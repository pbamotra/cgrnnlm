a form of asbestos once used to make <unk> cigarette filters has caused a high percentage of cancer deaths among a group of workers exposed to it more than n years ago researchers reported n
the asbestos fiber crocidolite is unusually resilient once it enters the lungs with even brief exposures to it causing symptoms that show up decades later researchers said <unk>
<unk> <unk> the unit of <unk> <unk> - based <unk> <unk> that makes <unk> cigarettes stopped using crocidolite in its <unk> cigarette filters in <unk>
although preliminary findings were reported more than a year ago the latest results appear in today <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> a forum likely to bring new attention to the problem
a <unk> spokewoman said this is an old story
we talking about years ago before anyone heard of asbestos having any questionable properties
there is no asbestos in our products now
neither <unk> nor the researchers who studied the workers were aware of any research on smokers of the <unk> cigarettes
we have no useful information on whether users are at risk said <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> led a team of researchers from the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the medical schools of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
the <unk> spokeswoman said <unk> asbestos was used in very modest amounts in making paper for the filters in the early n and replaced with a different type of filter in <unk>
from <unk> to <unk> <unk> billion <unk> cigarettes with the filters were sold the company said n
among n men who worked closely with the substance n have died more than three times the expected number
four of the five surviving workers have asbestos - related diseases including three with recently diagnosed cancer
the total of n deaths from malignant mesothelioma lung cancer and asbestosis was far higher than expected the researchers said <unk>
the morbidity rate is a striking finding among those of us who study asbestos - related diseases said <unk> <unk>
the percentage of lung cancer deaths among the workers at the <unk> <unk> <unk> paper factory appears to be the highest for any asbestos workers studied in western industrialized countries he said n
the plant which is owned by <unk> <unk> <unk> was under contract with <unk> to make the cigarette filters
the finding probably will support those who argue that the <unk> should regulate the class of asbestos including crocidolite more stringently than the common kind of asbestos chrysotile found in most schools and other buildings <unk> <unk> said <unk>
the <unk> is one of the few industrialized nations that does n't have a higher standard of regulation for the smooth needle - like fibers such as crocidolite that are classified as amphobiles according to <unk> <unk> <unk> a professor of pathlogy at the <unk> of <unk> <unk> of <unk>
more common chrysotile fibers are curly and are more easily rejected by the body <unk> <unk> explained <unk>
in <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> imposed a gradual ban on virtually all uses of asbestos
by <unk> almost all remaining uses of cancer - causing asbestos will be outlawed
about <unk> workers at a factory that made paper for the <unk> filters were exposed to asbestos in the n
areas of the factory were particularly dusty where the crocidolite was used
workers dumped large burlap sacks of the imported material into a huge bin poured in cotton and acetate fibers and mechanically mixed the dry fibers in a process used to make filters
workers described clouds of blue dust that hung over parts of the factory even though exhaust fans ventilated the area
there no question that some of those workers and managers contracted asbestos - related diseases said <unk> <unk> vice president of human resources for <unk> <unk>
but you have to recognize that these events took place n years ago
it has no bearing on our work force today

the survival of spinoff <unk> <unk> <unk> as a fledgling in the supercomputer business appears to depend heavily on the creativity and longevity of its chairman and chief designer <unk> <unk>
not only is development of the new company initial machine tied directly to <unk> <unk> so is its balance sheet
documents filed with the securities and <unk> <unk> on the pending spinoff disclosed that <unk> <unk> <unk> will withdraw the almost n million in financing n it is providing the new firm if <unk> <unk> leaves or if the product - design project n he heads is scrapped
the documents also said that although the <unk> <unk> <unk> has been working on the project for more than six years the <unk> machine is at least another year away from a fully operational prototype
moreover there have been no orders for the <unk> so far though the company says n it is talking with several prospects
while many of the risks were anticipated when <unk> - based <unk> <unk> first announced the spinoff in <unk> the strings n it attached to the financing had n't been made public until yesterday
we did n't have much of a choice <unk> <unk> chief financial officer <unk> <unk> said in an interview
the theory is that <unk> is the chief designer of the <unk> and without him it could not be completed
<unk> <unk> did not want to fund a project that did not include <unk>
the documents also said that <unk> <unk> anticipates needing perhaps another <unk> million in financing beginning next <unk>
but <unk> <unk> called that a worst - case scenario
the filing on the details of the spinoff caused <unk> <unk> stock to jump <unk> yesterday to close at <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> composite trading
analysts noted yesterday that <unk> <unk> decision to link its n million promissory note to <unk> <unk> presence will complicate a valuation of the new company
it has to be considered as an additional risk for the investor said <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> will be a concept stock he said
you either believe <unk> <unk> can do it again or you do n't
besides the designer age other risk factors for <unk> <unk> new company include the <unk> tricky unproven chip technology
the <unk> documents describe those chips which are made of gallium arsenide as being so fragile and minute n they will require special robotic handling equipment
in addition the n will contain <unk> processors twice as many as the largest current supercomputer
<unk> <unk> also will face intense competition not only from <unk> <unk> which has about <unk> of the world - wide supercomputer market and which is expected to roll out the <unk> machine a direct competitor with the <unk> in <unk>
the spinoff also will compete with <unk> <unk> machines <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
the new company said <unk> it believes n there are fewer than n potential customers for supercomputers priced between n million and n million presumably the n price range
under terms of the spinoff <unk> <unk> stockholders are to receive one <unk> <unk> share for every two <unk> <unk> shares n they own in a distribution expected to occur in about two weeks
no price for the new shares has been set
instead the companies will leave it up to the marketplace to decide
<unk> <unk> has applied to trade on <unk>
analysts calculate <unk> <unk> initial book value at about <unk> a share
along with the note <unk> <unk> is transferring about n million in assets primarily those related to the <unk> development which has been a drain on <unk> <unk> earnings
pro - forma balance sheets clearly show why <unk> <unk> favored the spinoff
without the n research and development expenses the company would have been able to report a profit of n million for the first half of n rather than the <unk> million n it posted
on the other hand had it existed then <unk> <unk> would have incurred a n million loss
<unk> <unk> who could n't be reached for comment will work for the new <unk> <unk> <unk> company as an independent contractor the arrangement n he had with <unk> <unk>

those countries including <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> are still of some concern to the <unk> but are deemed to pose less - serious problems for american patent and copyright owners than those on the priority list
<unk> <unk> a <unk> lawyer specializing in intellectual - property cases said n the threat of <unk> retaliation combined with a growing recognition that protecting intellectual property is in a country own interest prompted the improvements made by <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>

the new seven - year funds one offering a fixed - rate return and the other with a floating - rate return linked to the <unk> interbank offered rate offer two key advantages to japanese investors
first they are designed to eliminate the risk of prepayment mortgage - backed securities can be retired early if interest rates decline and such prepayment forces investors to redeploy their money at lower rates
second they channel monthly mortgage payments into semiannual payments reducing the administrative burden on investors
by addressing those problems <unk> <unk> said <unk> the new funds have become extremely attractive to japanese and other investors outside the <unk>
such devices have boosted japanese investment in mortgage - backed securities to more than <unk> of the <unk> billion in such instruments outstanding and their purchases are growing at a rapid rate
they also have become large purchasers of <unk> <unk> corporate debt buying n billion in <unk> <unk> bonds during the first nine months of the year or almost a tenth of the total amount issued

it the latest investment craze sweeping <unk> <unk> a rash of new closed - end country funds those publicly traded portfolios that invest in stocks of a single foreign country
no fewer than n country funds have been launched or registered with regulators this year triple the level of all of <unk> according to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> - based research firm
the turf recently has ranged from <unk> to <unk> to <unk>
next week the <unk> <unk> launch will be capped by a visit by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the first time <unk> a head of state has kicked off an issue at the <unk> <unk> here
the next province
anything possible how about the <unk> <unk> <unk> quips <unk> <unk> a managing partner at <unk> <unk> associates of <unk> <unk>
the recent explosion of country funds mirrors the closed - end fund mania of the <unk> <unk> <unk> says n when narrowly focused funds grew wildly popular
they fell into oblivion after the <unk> crash
unlike traditional open - end mutual funds most of these one - country portfolios are the closed - end type issuing a fixed number of shares that trade publicly
the surge brings to nearly n the number of country funds that are or soon will be listed in <unk> <unk> or <unk>
these funds now account for several billions of dollars in assets
people are looking to stake their claims now before the number of available nations runs out says <unk> <unk> an analyst at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
behind all the hoopla is some heavy - duty competition
as individual investors have turned away from the stock market over the years securities firms have scrambled to find new products that brokers find easy n to sell
and the firms are stretching their nets far and wide to do it
financial planners often urge investors to diversify and to hold a smattering of international securities
and many emerging markets have outpaced more mature markets such as the <unk> and <unk>
country funds offer an easy way n to get a taste of foreign stocks without the hard research of seeking out individual companies
but it does n't take much to get burned
political and currency gyrations can whipsaw the funds
another concern the funds share prices tend to swing more than the broader market
when the stock market dropped nearly <unk> <unk> n for instance the <unk> <unk> plunged about <unk> and the <unk> <unk> fell <unk>
and most country funds were clobbered more than most stocks after the <unk> crash
what so wild about the funds frenzy right now is that many are trading at historically fat premiums to the value of their underlying portfolios
after trading at an average discount of more than <unk> in late <unk> and part of last year country funds currently trade at an average premium of <unk>
the reason share prices of many of these funds this year have climbed much more sharply than the foreign stocks n they hold
it probably worth paying a premium for funds that invest in markets that are partially closed to foreign investors such as <unk> <unk> some specialists say n
but some european funds recently have skyrocketed <unk> <unk> has surged to a startling n premium
it has been targeted by japanese investors as a good long - term play tied to n european economic integration
and several new funds that are n't even fully invested yet have jumped to trade at big premiums
i very alarmed to see these rich valuations says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the newly fattened premiums reflect the increasingly global marketing of some country funds <unk> <unk> suggests <unk>
unlike many <unk> investors those in <unk> or <unk> seeking foreign - stock exposure may be less resistant to paying higher prices for country funds
there may be an international viewpoint cast on the funds listed here <unk> <unk> says
nonetheless plenty of <unk> analysts and money managers are aghast at the lofty trading levels of some country funds
they argue that <unk> investors often can buy american depositary receipts on the big stocks in many funds these so - called adrs represent shares of foreign companies traded in the <unk>
that way investors can essentially buy the funds without paying the premium
for people who insist on jumping in now to buy the funds <unk> <unk> <unk> says the only advice n i have for these folks is that those who come to the party late had better be ready to leave quickly
the <unk> and <unk> <unk> are holding technical talks about possible repayment by <unk> of n million in pre - communist russian debts owed to the <unk> government the <unk> <unk> said <unk>
if the debts are repaid it could clear the way n for soviet bonds to be sold in the <unk>
however after two meetings with the soviets a <unk> <unk> spokesman said that it too early to say whether that will happen
coincident with the talks the <unk> <unk> said <unk> it has permitted a soviet bank to open a <unk> <unk> branch
the branch of the <unk> for <unk> <unk> affairs was approved last spring and opened in <unk>
but a soviet bank here would be crippled unless <unk> found a way n to settle the n million debt which was lent to the country short - lived democratic <unk> government before the communists seized power in <unk>
under a <unk> law the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as amended it illegal for americans to extend credit to countries in default to the <unk> government unless they are members of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
the <unk> belongs to neither organization
<unk> has settled <unk> debts with other countries in recent years at less than face value
the <unk> <unk> stressed the <unk> debts as the key to satisfying the <unk> <unk>
but the soviets might still face legal obstacles to raising money in the <unk> until they settle hundreds of millions of dollars in additional debt still outstanding from the <unk> <unk> <unk> lend - lease program
in another reflection that the growth of the economy is leveling off the government said that orders for manufactured goods and spending on construction failed to rise in <unk>
meanwhile the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> said <unk> its latest survey indicated that the manufacturing economy contracted in <unk> for the sixth consecutive month
its index inched up to <unk> in <unk> from <unk> in <unk>
any reading below <unk> suggests n the manufacturing sector is generally declining
the purchasing managers however also said that orders turned up in <unk> after four months of decline
factories booked n billion in orders in <unk> nearly the same as the <unk> billion in <unk> the <unk> <unk> said <unk>
if not for a <unk> surge in orders for capital goods by defense contractors factory orders would have fallen <unk>
in a separate report the department said n construction spending ran at an annual rate of n billion not significantly different from the <unk> billion reported for <unk>
private construction spending was down but government building activity was up
the figures in both reports were adjusted to remove the effects of usual seasonal patterns but were n't adjusted for inflation
<unk> <unk> economist for <unk> <unk> a <unk> bank said n demand for exports of factory goods is beginning to taper off
at the same time the drop in interest rates since the spring has failed to revive the residential construction industry
what sector is stepping forward to pick up the slack he asked
i draw a blank
by most measures the nation industrial sector is now growing very slowly if at all
factory payrolls fell in <unk>
so did the <unk> <unk> <unk> industrial - production index
yet many economists are n't predicting that the economy is about to slip into recession
they cite a lack of imbalances that provide early warning signals of a downturn
inventories are closely watched for such clues for instance
economists say n a buildup in inventories can provoke cutbacks in production that can lead to a recession
but yesterday factory orders report had good news on that front it said <unk> factory inventories fell n in <unk> the first decline since <unk> n
this conforms to the soft landing scenario said <unk> <unk> an economist at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
i do n't see any signs that inventories are excessive
a soft landing is an economic slowdown that eases inflation without leading to a recession
the department said n orders for nondurable goods those intended to last fewer than three years fell n in <unk> to n billion after climbing <unk> the month before
orders for durable goods were up <unk> to n billion after rising <unk> the month before
the department previously estimated that durable - goods orders fell <unk> in <unk>
factory shipments fell <unk> to n billion after rising n in <unk>
shipments have been relatively level since <unk> the <unk> <unk> noted <unk>
manufacturers backlogs of unfilled orders rose n in <unk> to n billion helped by strength in the defense capital goods sector
excluding these orders backlogs declined <unk>
in its construction spending report the <unk> <unk> said <unk> residential construction which accounts for nearly half of all construction spending was off <unk> in <unk> to an annual rate of n billion
<unk> <unk> economist for the <unk> bankers <unk> predicted <unk> the drop in interest rates eventually will boost spending on single - family homes but probably not until early next year
spending on private nonresidential construction was off <unk> to an annual rate of n billion with no sector showing strength
<unk> construction spending rose n to n billion
after adjusting for inflation the <unk> <unk> said <unk> construction spending did n't change in <unk>
for the first nine months of the year total construction spending ran about n above last year level
the government construction spending figures contrast with a report issued earlier in the week by <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> reported an n increase in construction contracts awarded in <unk>
the goverment counts money as it is spent <unk> counts contracts when they are awarded
the government includes money spent on residential renovation <unk> does n't
although the purchasing managers index continues to indicate a slowing economy it is n't signaling an imminent recession said <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman of the association survey committee and director of materials management at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
he said <unk> the index would have to be in the low n range for several months to be considered a forecast of recession
the report offered new evidence that the nation export growth though still continuing may be slowing
only n of the purchasing managers reported better export orders in <unk> down from <unk> in <unk>
and <unk> said n export orders were down last month compared with n the month before
the purhasing managers report also added evidence that inflation is under control
for the fifth consecutive month purchasing managers said n prices for the goods n they purchased fell
the decline was even steeper than in <unk>
they also said that vendors were delivering goods more quickly in <unk> than they had for each of the five previous months
economists consider that a sign that inflationary pressures are abating
when demand is stronger than suppliers can handle and delivery times lengthen prices tend to rise
the purchasing managers report is based on data provided by more than <unk> purchasing executives
each of the survey indicators gauges the difference between the number of purchasers reporting improvement in a particular area and the number reporting a worsening
for the first time the <unk> survey polled members on imports
it found that of the n who import <unk> said n they imported more in <unk> and <unk> said n they imported less than the previous month
while acknowledging n one month figures do n't prove a trend <unk> <unk> said it does lead you to suspect <unk> imports are going down or at least not increasing that much
items listed as being in short supply numbered only about a dozen but they included one newcomer milk and milk powder
it an odd thing n to put on the list <unk> <unk> noted
he said that for the second month in a row food processors reported a shortage of nonfat dry milk
they blamed increased demand for dairy products at a time of exceptionally high <unk> exports of dry milk coupled with very low import quotas

judging from the <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> pages n baby boomers on both sides of the <unk> have a lot in common
although set in <unk> the novel texture is almost entirely western especially american
characters drink <unk> <unk> whistle <unk> <unk> <unk> and watch <unk> <unk> reruns
they read <unk> <unk> and talk about <unk> and <unk>
they worry about their careers drink too much and suffer through broken marriages and desultory affairs
this is <unk>
for an american reader part of the charm of this engaging novel should come in recognizing that <unk> is n't the buttoned - down society of contemporary american lore
it also refreshing to read a japanese author who clearly does n't belong to the self - aggrandizing we - japanese school of writers who perpetuate the notion of the unique japanese unfathomable by outsiders
if a <unk> <unk> <unk> carries an implicit message for international relations it that the japanese are more like us than most of us think n
that not to say that the nutty plot of a <unk> <unk> <unk> is rooted in reality
it imaginative and often funny
a disaffected hard - drinking n hero sets off for snow country in search of an elusive sheep with a star on its back at the behest of a sinister erudite mobster with a <unk> degree
he has in tow his prescient girlfriend whose sassy retorts mark her as anything but a docile butterfly
along the way he meets a solicitous christian chauffeur who offers the hero <unk> phone number and the <unk> <unk> a sweet roughhewn figure who wears what else a sheepskin
the <unk> <unk> <unk> is a publishing sensation in <unk>
a more recent novel norwegian wood every japanese under <unk> seems to be fluent in <unk> lyrics has sold more than four million copies since <unk> published it in <unk>
but he is just one of several youthful writers <unk> brat pack who are dominating the best - seller charts in <unk>
their books are written in idiomatic contemporary language and usually carry hefty dashes of <unk>
in <unk> <unk> you <unk> have <unk> <unk> <unk> pages n the beatles give way to baseball in the <unk> version n we would be hard put to call a game

<unk> is japanese for team spirit and japanese ballplayers have miles and miles of it
a player commitment to practice and team image is as important as his batting average

but other than the fact that besuboru is played with a ball and a bat it unrecognizable fans politely return foul balls to stadium ushers the strike zone expands depending on the size of the hitter ties are permitted even welcomed since they honorably sidestep the shame of defeat players must abide by strict rules of conduct even in their personal lives players for the <unk> giants for example must always wear ties when on the road
you <unk> have <unk> is the often amusing chronicle of how american ballplayers rationed to two per team fare in <unk>
despite the enormous sums of money n they paid to stand up at a japanese plate a good number decide n it not worth it and run for home
funny <unk> <unk> <unk> pages <unk> by <unk> <unk> is anything but
it the petulant complaint of an impudent american whom <unk> hosted for a year while he was on a <unk> <unk> in <unk> to the regret of both parties
in sometimes amusing more often supercilious even vicious passages <unk> <unk> describes how <unk> invades even the most mundane aspects of its workers lives at the regimented office where employees are assigned lunch partners and at home in the austere company dormitory run by a prying caretaker
some of his observations about japanese management style are on the mark
it probably true that many salarymen put in unproductive overtime just for the sake of solidarity that the system is so hierarchical that only the assistant manager can talk to the manager and the manager to the general manager and that <unk> was chary of letting a young short - term american employee take on any responsibility
all of this must have been enormously frustrating to <unk> <unk> who went to <unk> with degrees in business and computer science and was raring to invent another <unk>
but <unk> ultimately took a lesson from the american management books and fired <unk> <unk> after he committed the social crime of making an appointment to see the venerable <unk> <unk> founder of <unk>

as an actor <unk> <unk> is n't the inheritor of <unk> <unk> spirit
<unk> <unk> has already laid his claim to that
but it is <unk> <unk> as movie director producer and writer who has been obsessed with refitting <unk> <unk> <unk> in a contemporary way
in <unk> as a film student at the <unk> campus of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> shot a <unk> in <unk> a <unk> black - and-white film about a sketch artist a man of the streets
now n years later <unk> <unk> has revived his artist in a full - length movie called <unk> stories a poignant piece of work about a modern - day tramp
of course if the film contained dialogue <unk> <unk> <unk> would be called a homeless person
so would the little <unk> for that matter

<unk> <unk> <unk> a college friend of <unk> <unk> who earns his living playing the double bass in classical music ensembles has prepared an exciting eclectic score that tells you what the characters are thinking and feeling far more precisely than intertitles or even words would
much of <unk> <unk> film takes a highly romanticized view of life on the streets though probably no more romanticized than <unk> <unk> notion of the <unk> as the good - hearted free spirit
filmed in lovely black and white by <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> streets of <unk> stories seem benign
on <unk> <unk> men and women walk with great purpose noticing one another only when they jostle for cabs
the artist hangs out in <unk> <unk> on a strip of <unk> <unk> populated by jugglers magicians and other good - natured hustlers
this clearly is not real life no crack dealers no dead - eyed men selling four - year-old copies of <unk> no one curled up in a cardboard box
the artist has his routine
he spends his days sketching passers - by or trying to
at night he returns to the condemned building n he calls home
his life including his skirmishes with a competing sketch artist seems carefree
he is his own man
then just as the <unk> is given a blind girl n to cure in <unk> <unk> the artist is put in charge of returning a two - year-old waif <unk> <unk> whose father has been murdered by thugs to her mother
this cute child turns out to be a blessing and a curse
she gives the artist a sense of purpose but also alerts him to the serious inadequacy of his vagrant life
the beds at the <unk> <unk> seem far drearier when he has to tuck a little girl into one of them at night
to further load the stakes <unk> <unk> dreamed up a highly improbable romance for the artist with a young woman who owns her own children shop and who lives in an expensive high - rise apartment building
this story line might resonate more strongly if <unk> <unk> had as strong a presence in front of the camera as he does behind it
<unk> <unk> final purpose is n't to glamorize the artist vagabond existence
he has a point <unk> he wants to make and he makes it with a great deal of force
the movie ends with sound the sound of street people talking and there is n't anything whimsical or enviable in those rough beaten voices
the french film maker <unk> <unk> has managed another kind of weird achievement with his story of women

but she did n't deserve to have her head chopped off
there is very little n to recommend <unk> <unk> a confused rendering of the <unk> <unk> novel of the <unk> <unk>
most of the picture is taken up with endless scenes of many people either fighting or eating and drinking to celebrate victory

this is the year <unk> the negative ad for years a secondary presence in most political campaigns became the main event
the irony is that the attack commercial after getting a boost in last year presidential campaign has come of age in an off - off election year with only a few contests scattered across the country
but in the three leading political contests of <unk> the negative ads have reached new levels of hostility raising fears that this kind of mudslinging empty of significant issues is ushering in a new era of campaigns without content
now says <unk> <unk> a pioneer in political television the idea is to attack first last and always
a trend that started with the first stirrings of politics accelerated with the dawn of the television age and became a sometimes - tawdry art form in <unk> has reached an entirely new stage
to get people attention these days says <unk> <unk> a political consultant your tv ad needs to be bold and entertaining and more often than not that means confrontational
and unlike a few years ago you do n't even have to worry whether the ad is truthful
in <unk> as often as not the principal fights in the major campaigns are prompted by the ads themselves
take a look then at the main attack commercials that set the tone for <unk> elections in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
the screen fills with a small tight facial shot of <unk> <unk> democratic candidate for mayor of <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> failed to file his income taxes for four straight years says a disembodied male voice
and then this television commercial paid for by <unk> <unk> <unk> campaign and produced by <unk> <unk> the master of negative tv ads really gets down to business
<unk> <unk> the ad charges <unk> also failed to report his campaign contributions accurately hid his links to a failing insurance company and paid a convicted kidnapper through a phony organization with no members no receipts and no office
<unk> <unk> says the kicker why does he always wait until he caught
<unk> innuendoes says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> issues director designed to prosecute a case of political corruption that simply does n't exist
stung by the <unk> ads <unk> <unk> <unk> consultants <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> finally unleashed a negative ad of their own
the screen shows two distorted unrecognizable photos presumably of two politicians
compare two candidates for mayor says the announcer
one says n he for banning cop - killer bullets
the other has opposed a ban on cop - killer bullets
one claims <unk> he pro - choice
the other has opposed a woman right to choose
funny thing says the kicker both these candidates are named <unk> <unk>
who telling the truth
everybody and nobody
it a classic situation of ads that are true but not always fully accurate
<unk> <unk> did fail to file his income taxes for four years but he insists n he voluntarily admitted the oversight when he was being considered for a city job
he was on the board of an insurance company with financial problems but he insists n he made no secret of it
the city <unk> <unk> <unk> has refused to pay <unk> <unk> <unk> in matching funds because his campaign records are incomplete
the campaign has blamed these reporting problems on computer errors
and says <unk> <unk> <unk> he did n't know <unk> the man n his campaign paid for a get - out-the-vote effort had been convicted of kidnapping
but say <unk> <unk> <unk> managers he did have an office and his organization did have members
<unk> <unk> campaign chairman <unk> <unk> says n the <unk> ad is deceptive
the other side he argues <unk> knows <unk> <unk> has always been pro - choice even though he has personal reservations
they know n he is generally opposed to cop - killer bullets but that he had some reservations about the language in the legislation
<unk>
democratic <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> opened his gubernatorial battle with <unk> <unk> <unk> with an abortion commercial produced by <unk> <unk> that analysts of every political persuasion agree n was a tour de force
against a shot of <unk> superimposed on an american flag an announcer talks about the strong tradition of freedom and individual liberty that virginians have nurtured for generations
then just as an image of the statue of <unk> <unk> dissolves from the screen the announcer continues on the issue of abortion <unk> <unk> wants to take away your right to choose and give it to the politicians
that commercial which said <unk> <unk> <unk> wanted to take away the right of abortion even in cases of rape and incest a charge <unk> <unk> <unk> denies changed the dynamics of the campaign transforming it at least in part into a referendum on abortion
the ad prompted <unk> <unk> the former <unk> attorney general to launch a series of advertisements created by <unk> <unk> and designed to shake <unk> <unk> support among the very women who were attracted by the abortion ad
the <unk> counterattack featured a close - up of a young woman in shadows and the ad suggested that she was recalling an unpleasant courtroom ordeal
a voice says <unk> now do n't you have boyfriends
then an announcer interjects it was <unk> <unk> who introduced a bill <unk> to force rape victims age <unk> and younger to be interrogated about their private lives by lawyers for accused rapists
so the next time <unk> <unk> <unk> talks about the rights of women ask him about this law <unk> he tried to pass
<unk> <unk> did introduce such legislation n years ago but he did so at the request of a constituent a common legislative technique used by lawmakers
the legislation itself noted that it was introduced by request and in <unk> <unk> <unk> introduced a bill <unk> to protect rape victims from unfounded interrogation
people have grown tired of these ads and <unk> has gotten the stigma of being a negative campaigner says <unk> <unk> a political scientist at <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> has managed to get across the idea that <unk> will say anything to get elected governor and more important has been able to put the onus for all the negative campaigning on <unk>
<unk> <unk> said this week that he would devote the remainder of the political season to positive campaigning but the truce lasted only hours
by <unk> night television stations were carrying new ads featuring <unk> <unk> himself raising questions about <unk> <unk> sensitivity to rape victims
<unk> <unk>
the attacks began when democratic <unk> <unk> <unk> aired an ad featuring a drawing of <unk> and a photograph of <unk> <unk> rival <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
remember <unk> says a female voice
consider <unk> <unk>
and then this commercial produced by <unk> <unk> gets down to its own mean and dirty business
pictures of rusted oil drums swim into focus and the female voice purrs that hazardous waste on his <unk> <unk> property the neighbors are suing for consumer fraud
and the nose on <unk> <unk> face grows
the only fraud involved cry <unk> <unk> partisans is the <unk> commercial itself and so the <unk> campaign has responded with its own <unk> commercial produced by <unk> <unk>
in this one the screen fills with photographs of both candidates
who really lying asks a female voice
<unk> lying the voice goes on because the barrel on <unk> land contained heating oil was cleaned up and caused no pollution
<unk> <unk> long nose shrinks while <unk> <unk> grows
who telling the truth
<unk> <unk> a political scientist at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> says <unk> it another example of an ad that true but not fully accurate
barrels were dumped on the <unk> property a complaint was made but there is no evidence n the barrels were a serious threat to the environment
even so according to <unk> <unk> the ad was devastating because it raised questions about <unk> <unk> credibility
but it building on a long tradition
in <unk> on route to a re - election rout of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> appeared in person saying if you want to keep the crime rates high <unk> is your man
a seat on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> was sold for <unk> down <unk> from the previous sale last <unk>
seats currently are quoted at <unk> bid and <unk> asked
the record price for a full membership on the exchange is <unk> set <unk> <unk> <unk>
japanese investment in <unk> <unk> is propelling the region toward economic integration
interviews with analysts and business people in the <unk> suggest that japanese capital may produce the economic cooperation that southeast asian politicians have pursued in fits and starts for decades
but <unk> power in the region also is sparking fears of domination and posing fresh policy questions
the flow of japanese funds has set in motion a process whereby these economies will be knitted together by the great japanese investment machine says <unk> <unk> <unk> vice chairman of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
in the past five years japanese companies have tripled their commitments in <unk> to n billion
in <unk> for example the government <unk> of <unk> approved <unk> million of japanese investment in <unk> <unk> times the <unk> investment figure for the year
<unk> commitment in <unk> <unk> also includes steep increases in foreign assistance and trade
<unk> other cash - rich countries are following <unk> lead and pumping capital into the region
in <unk> and <unk> <unk> rising wages are forcing manufacturers to seek other overseas sites for labor - intensive production
these nations known as <unk> little tigers also are contributing to <unk> <unk> integration but their influence will remain subordinate to <unk>
for recipient countries such as <unk> and <unk> the investment will provide needed jobs and spur growth
but asian nations harsh memories of their military domination by <unk> in the early part of this century make them fearful of falling under japanese economic hegemony now
because of budget constraints in <unk> the <unk> encourages <unk> to share economic burdens in the region
but it resists yielding political ground
in the coming decade analysts say n u.s.-japanese relations will be tested as <unk> comes to terms with its new status as the region economic behemoth
<unk> swelling investment in <unk> <unk> is part of its economic evolution
in the past decade japanese manufacturers concentrated on domestic production for export
in the n spurred by rising labor costs and the strong yen these companies will increasingly turn themselves into multinationals with plants around the world
to capture the investment southeast asian nations will move to accommodate japanese business
these nations internal decisions will be made in a way n not to offend their largest aid donor largest private investor and largest lender says <unk> <unk> <unk> director of the international business and research program at the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>
japanese money will help turn <unk> <unk> into a more cohesive economic region
but analysts say n asian cooperation is n't likely to parallel the <unk> <unk> <unk> approach
rather japanese investment will spur integration of certain sectors says <unk> <unk> <unk> a specialist in <unk> asian economies at the <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> and <unk> affairs at <unk> <unk>
in electronics for example a japanese company might make television picture tubes in <unk> assemble the sets in <unk> and export them to <unk>
the effect will be to pull <unk> together not as a common market but as an integrated production zone says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
countries in the region also are beginning to consider a framework for closer economic and political ties
the economic and foreign ministers of n <unk> and <unk> nations will meet in <unk> next week to discuss global trade issues as well as regional matters such as transportation and telecommunications
participants will include the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> as well as the six members of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the philippines and <unk>
in addition the <unk> this year offered its own plan for cooperation around the <unk> rim in a major speech by <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> following up a proposal made in <unk> by australian <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the <unk> proposal reasserts <unk> intention to continue playing a leading political role in the region
in <unk> as in <unk> a new order is taking shape <unk> <unk> said <unk>
the <unk> with its regional friends must play a crucial role in designing its architecture
but maintaining <unk> influence will be difficult in the face of japanese dominance in the region
<unk> not only outstrips the <unk> in investment flows but also outranks it in trade with most southeast asian countries although the <unk> remains the leading trade partner for all of <unk>
moreover the japanese government now the world largest aid donor is pumping far more assistance into the region than the <unk> is
while <unk> officials voice optimism about <unk> enlarged role in <unk> they also convey an undertone of caution
there an understanding on the part of the <unk> that <unk> has to expand its functions in <unk> says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> undersecretary of commerce for trade
if they approach it with a benevolent altruistic attitude there will be a net gain for everyone
some asian nations are apprehensive about <unk> demand that <unk> step up its military spending to ease the <unk> security burden in the region
the issue is further complicated by uncertainty over the future of the <unk> leases on military bases in the philippines and by a possible <unk> troop reduction in <unk> <unk>
many asians regard a <unk> presence as a desirable counterweight to japanese influence
no one wants the <unk> to pick up its marbles and go home <unk> <unk> says
for their part <unk> and <unk> <unk> are expected to step up their own investments in the next decade to try to slow the japanese juggernaut
they do n't want <unk> to monopolize the region and sew it up says <unk> - <unk> <unk> professor of <unk> asian politics at the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> <unk> could hardly believe her eyes
while giving the <unk> <unk> of <unk> skills to ninth graders at <unk> <unk> <unk> last <unk> <unk> she spotted a student looking at crib sheets
she had seen cheating before but these notes were uncanny
a stockbroker is an example of a profession in trade and finance
at the end of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> surrendered before <unk>
the <unk> - <unk> conference committee is used when a bill is passed by the <unk> and <unk> in different forms
virtually word for word the notes matched questions and answers on the social - studies section of the test <unk> the student was taking
in fact the student had the answers to almost all of the <unk> questions in that section
the student surrendered the notes but not without a protest
my teacher said n it was ok for me to use the notes on the test he said
the teacher in question was <unk> <unk> considered by many students and parents to be one of the best at the school
confronted <unk> <unk> admitted <unk> she had given the questions and answers two days before the examination to two low - ability geography classes
she had gone so far as to display the questions on an overhead projector and underline the answers
<unk> <unk> was fired and prosecuted under an unusual <unk> <unk> law that makes it a crime to breach test security
in <unk> she pleaded guilty and paid a n fine
her alternative was n days in jail
her story is partly one of personal downfall
she was an unstinting teacher who won laurels and inspired students but she will probably never teach again
in her wake she left the bitterness and anger of a principal who was her friend and now calls her a betrayer of colleagues who say n she brought them shame of students and parents who defended her and insist <unk> she was treated harshly and of school - district officials stunned that despite the bald - faced nature of her actions she became something of a local martyr
<unk> <unk> case also casts some light on the dark side of school reform where pressures on teachers are growing and where high - stakes testing has enhanced the temptation to cheat
the <unk> statute <unk> <unk> <unk> violated was designed to enforce provisions of <unk> <unk> school - improvement laws
prosecutors alleged that she was trying to bolster students scores to win a bonus under the state <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the bonus depended on her ability to produce higher student - test scores
there is incredible pressure on school systems and teachers to raise test scores says <unk> <unk> an education professor and testing specialist at <unk> <unk>
so efforts to beat the tests are also on the rise
and most disturbing it is educators not students who are blamed for much of the wrongdoing
a <unk> study released in <unk> by friends for <unk> an <unk> <unk> school - research group concluded that outright cheating by american educators is common
the group says <unk> standardized achievement test scores are greatly inflated because teachers often teach the test as <unk> <unk> did although most are never caught
evidence of widespread cheating has surfaced in several states in the last year or so
<unk> education department suspects adult responsibility for erasures at <unk> schools that changed wrong answers to right ones on a statewide test
after numerous occurrences of questionable teacher help to students <unk> is revising its security practices
and sales of test - coaching booklets for classroom instruction are booming
these materials including <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> materials are nothing short of sophisticated crib sheets according to some recent academic research
by using them teachers with administrative blessing telegraph to students beforehand the precise areas on which a test will concentrate and sometimes give away a few exact questions and answers
<unk> of <unk> <unk> is widespread in <unk> <unk> and common in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> school district
experts say n there is n't another state in the country where tests mean as much as they do in <unk> <unk>
under the state <unk> <unk> <unk> low test scores can block students promotions or force entire districts into wrenching state - supervised interventions that can mean firings
high test scores on the other hand bring recognition and extra money a new computer lab for a school grants for special projects a bonus for the superintendent
and <unk> <unk> says n it is getting results
since the reforms went in place for example no state has posted a higher rate of improvement on the <unk> <unk> <unk> than <unk> <unk> although the state still posts the lowest average score of the about n states who use the <unk> as the primary college entrance examination
critics say <unk> <unk> <unk> is paying a price by stressing improved test scores so much
friends of <unk> rates <unk> <unk> one of the worst seven states in its study on academic cheating
says <unk> the organization founder <unk> <unk> prosecuting <unk> <unk> is a way for n administrators to protect themselves and look like they take cheating seriously when in fact they do n't take it seriously at all
<unk> <unk> director of testing for the <unk> <unk> department of education says <unk> <unk> <unk> allegations of cheating are purely without foundation and based on unfair inferences
partly because of worries about potential abuse however he says n the state will begin keeping closer track of achievement - test preparation booklets next spring
<unk> <unk> reforms were designed for schools like <unk> <unk> <unk>
standing on a shaded hill in a run - down area of this old textile city the school has educated many of <unk> <unk> best and brightest including the state last two governors <unk> <unk> winning physicist <unk> <unk> and actress <unk> <unk>
but by the early n its glory had faded like the yellow bricks of its broad facade
it was full of violence and gangs and kids cutting class says <unk> <unk> the school principal
crime was awful test scores were low and there was no enrollment in honors programs
<unk> <unk> took over in <unk> becoming the school seventh principal in n years
her immediate predecessor suffered a nervous breakdown
prior to his term a teacher bled to death in the halls stabbed by a student
academically <unk> <unk> says <unk> the school was having trouble serving in harmony its two disparate and evenly split student groups a privileged white elite from old monied neighborhoods and blacks many of them poor from run - down inner city neighborhoods
<unk> <unk> resolved to clean out deadwood in the school faculty and restore safety and she also had some new factors working in her behalf
one was statewide school reform which raised overall educational funding and ushered in a new public spirit for school betterment
another was <unk> <unk> who came to <unk> in <unk> full of the energy and ambitions that reformers wanted to reward
being a teacher just became my life says the <unk> <unk> <unk> a teacher for n years before her dismissal
i loved the school its history
i even dreamt about school and new things <unk> to do with my students
while <unk> <unk> fired and restructured staff and struggled to improve curriculum <unk> <unk> worked n days and fast became a student favorite
in <unk> and <unk> she applied for and won bonus pay under the reform law
encouraged by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> taught honor students in the state teacher cadet program a reform creation designed to encourage good students to consider teaching as a career
she won grant money for the school advised cheerleaders ran the pep club proposed and taught a new <unk> <unk> class in <unk> <unk> and was chosen by the school <unk> as teacher of the <unk>
she was an inspirational lady she had it all together says <unk> <unk> a freshman at the <unk> of <unk> <unk> who had <unk> <unk> in the teacher - cadet class last year
she says that because of <unk> <unk> she gave up ambitions in architecture and is studying to become a teacher
<unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> grader also says <unk> <unk> <unk> inspired her to go into education
she taught us more in <unk> <unk> than i ever learned in other classes says <unk> <unk> a <unk> senior
in the classroom students say <unk> <unk> <unk> distinguished herself by varying teaching approaches forcing kids to pair up to complete classroom work or using college - bowl type competitions
on weekends she came to work to prepare study plans or sometimes even to polish the furniture in her classroom
she just never gave it up says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> mother
you see her correcting homework in the stands at a football game
some fellow teachers however viewed <unk> <unk> as cocky and too yielding to students
<unk> <unk> says <unk> she often defended her to colleagues who called her a grandstander
pressures began to build
friends told her <unk> she was pushing too hard
because of deteriorating hearing she told colleagues <unk> she feared <unk> she might not be able to teach much longer
<unk> <unk> extra work was also helping her earn points in the state incentive - bonus program
but the most important source of points was student improvement on tests
huge gains by her students in <unk> and <unk> meant a total of n in bonuses over two years a meaningful addition to her annual salary of <unk>
winning a bonus for a third year was n't that important to her <unk> <unk> insists n
but others at <unk> <unk> say n she was eager to win if not for money then for pride and recognition
<unk> <unk> <unk> another social - studies teacher says n she believed <unk> <unk> <unk> wanted to keep her standing high so she could get a new job that would n't demand good hearing
indeed <unk> <unk> was interested in a possible job with the state teacher cadet program
last <unk> after attending a teaching seminar in <unk> <unk> <unk> says <unk> she returned to <unk> two days before annual testing feeling that she had n't prepared her low - ability geography students adequately
when test booklets were passed out n hours ahead of time she says n she copied questions in the social studies section and gave the answers to students
<unk> <unk> admits <unk> she made a big mistake but insists n her motives were correct
i was trying to help kids in an unfair testing situation she says
only five of the n questions were geography questions
the rest were history sociology finance subjects n they never had
<unk> <unk> says that she also wanted to help lift <unk> <unk> <unk> overall test scores usually near the bottom of n district high schools in rankings carried annually by local newspapers
mostly she says n she wanted to prevent the damage to self - esteem that her low - ability students would suffer from doing badly on the test
these kids broke my heart she says
a whole day goes by and no one even knows <unk> they alive
they desperately needed somebody who showed <unk> they cared for them who loved them
the last thing n they needed was another drag - down blow
<unk> officials and prosecutors say <unk> <unk> <unk> is lying
they found students in an advanced class a year earlier who said n she gave them similar help although because the case was n't tried in court this evidence was never presented publicly
that pretty much defeats any inkling that she was out to help the poor underprivileged child says <unk> <unk> the prosecutor in the case who is also president of <unk> <unk> <unk> alumni association
<unk> <unk> concedes that she went over the questions in the earlier class adding i wanted to help all students
<unk> <unk> says <unk> <unk> <unk> never complained to school officials that the standardized test was unfair
do i have much sympathy for her <unk> <unk> asks
not really
i believe in the system
i believe n you have to use the system to change it
what she did was like taking the law into your own hands
<unk> <unk> says that when the cheating was discovered she wanted to avoid the morale - damaging public disclosure that a trial would bring
she says <unk> she offered <unk> <unk> a quiet resignation and thought <unk> she could help save her teaching certificate
<unk> <unk> declined
she said something like you just want to make it easy for the school
i was dumbfounded <unk> <unk> recalls
it was like someone had turned a knife in me
to the astonishment and dismay of her superiors and legal authorities and perhaps as a measure of the unpopularity of standardized tests <unk> <unk> won widespread local support
the school - board hearing at which she was dismissed was crowded with students teachers and parents who came to testify on her behalf
supportive callers decried unfair testing not <unk> <unk> on a local radio talk show on which she appeared
the show did n't give the particulars of <unk> <unk> offense saying only that she helped students do better on the test
the message to the board of education out of all this is n we got to take a serious look at how we doing our curriculum and our testing policies in this state said the talk - show host
editorials in the <unk> newspaper allowed that <unk> <unk> was wrong but also said n the case showed how testing was being overused
the radio show enraged us says <unk> <unk>
partly because of the show <unk> <unk> says <unk> the district decided not to recommend <unk> <unk> for a first - time offenders program that could have expunged the charges and the conviction from her record
and legal authorities cranked up an investigation worthy of a murder case
over <unk> witnesses mostly students were interviewed
at <unk> <unk> <unk> meanwhile some students especially on the cheerleading squad were crushed
it hard to explain to a n why someone n they like had to go says <unk> <unk>
soon t - shirts appeared in the corridors that carried the school familiar red - and-white <unk> logo on the front
on the back the shirts read we have all the answers
many colleagues are angry at <unk> <unk>
she did a lot of harm says <unk> <unk> who had discovered the crib notes
we work damn hard at what we do for damn little pay and what she did cast unfair aspersions on all of us
but several teachers also say n the incident casts doubt on the wisdom of evaluating teachers or schools by using standardized test scores
says <unk> <unk> a mathematics teacher the incentive pay thing has opened up a can of worms
there may be others doing what she did
<unk> <unk> says <unk> she pleaded guilty because she realized <unk> it would no longer be possible to win reinstatement and because she was afraid of further charges
<unk> <unk> for one was relieved
despite the strong evidence against <unk> <unk> popular sentiment was so strong in her favor <unk> <unk> says <unk> that i afraid <unk> a jury would n't have convicted her
since chalk first touched slate schoolchildren have wanted to know what on the test
these days students can often find the answer in test - coaching workbooks and worksheets n their teachers give them in the weeks prior to taking standardized achievement tests
the mathematics section of the widely used <unk> <unk> <unk> asks fifth graders what is another name for the <unk> numeral <unk>
it also asks them to add two - sevenths and three - sevenths
worksheets in a test - practice kit called <unk> materials sold to schools across the country by <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> contain the same questions
in many other instances there is almost no difference between the real test and <unk> materials
what more the test and <unk> materials are both produced by the same company <unk> - <unk> a joint venture of <unk> - <unk> <unk> and <unk> parent <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
close parallels between tests and practice tests are common some educators and researchers say n
test - preparation booklets software and worksheets are a booming publishing subindustry
but some practice products are so similar to the tests themselves that critics say n they represent a form of school - sponsored cheating
if i took these preparation booklets into my classroom i have a hard time justifying to my students and parents that it was n't cheating says <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> teacher who has studied test coaching
he and other critics say n such coaching aids can defeat the purpose of standardized tests which is to gauge learning progress
it as if <unk> decided to give only french history questions to students in a european history class and when everybody aces the test they say n their kids are good in european history says <unk> <unk> an <unk> <unk> psychiatrist and founder of an educational research organization friends for <unk> which has studied standardized testing
standardized achievement tests are given about n million times a year across the country to students generally from kindergarten through eighth grade
the most widely used of these tests are macmillan\/mcgraw cat and <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> of <unk> skills by <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> test
sales figures of the test - prep materials are n't known but their reach into schools is significant
in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> educators say n they are common classroom tools
<unk> says n well over n million of its <unk> high test - preparation books have been sold since their introduction n years ago with most sales in the last five years
about n sets of <unk> <unk> teachers binders have also been sold in the past four years
the materials in each set reach about n students
scoring <unk> and <unk> materials are the best - selling preparation tests
<unk> <unk> director of marketing for <unk> <unk> the <unk> division that publishes <unk> <unk> says n it is n't aimed at improving test scores
he also asserted that exact questions were n't replicated
when referred to the questions that matched he said n it was coincidental
<unk> <unk> the schoolteacher and <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> education professor concluded in a study last <unk> that <unk> test versions of <unk> <unk> and <unk> materials should n't be used in the classroom because of their similarity to the actual test
they devised a n scale awarding one point for each subskill measured on the cat test to rate the closeness of test preparatives to the fifth - grade <unk>
because many of these subskills the symmetry of geometrical figures metric measurement of volume or pie and bar graphs for example are only a small part of the total fifth - grade curriculum <unk> <unk> says <unk> the preparation kits would n't replicate too many if their real intent was general instruction or even general familiarization with test procedures
but <unk> materials matched on <unk> of n subskills
scoring high matched on <unk>
in <unk> sections where students knowledge of two - letter consonant sounds is tested the authors noted that <unk> <unk> concentrated on the same sounds that the test does to the exclusion of other sounds that fifth graders should know
<unk> materials for the fifth - grade contains at least a dozen examples of exact matches or close parallels to test items
<unk> <unk> senior editor of <unk> <unk> says that <unk> <unk> and <unk> are ignoring the need n students have for becoming familiar with tests and testing format
he said <unk> authors of <unk> <unk> scrupulously avoid replicating exact questions but he does n't deny that some items are similar
when scoring <unk> first came out in <unk> it was a publication of <unk> <unk>
<unk> - <unk> was outraged
in a n advisory to educators <unk> - <unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> should n't be used because it represented a parallel form of the <unk> and <unk> tests
but in <unk> <unk> - <unk> purchased the <unk> <unk> unit that publishes <unk> <unk> which later became part of <unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk> say <unk> they are unaware of any efforts by <unk> - <unk> to modify or discontinue <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> said <unk> it completed the acquisition of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for n million
the <unk> - based s&l which has n branch offices in north central <unk> had assets of n billion at the end of <unk>
<unk> <unk> - based <unk> is an insurance and financial services concern

the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> services plans to extend its moratorium on federal funding of research involving fetal - tissue transplants
medical researchers believe n the transplantation of small amounts of fetal tissue into humans could help treat juvenile diabetes and such degenerative diseases as <unk> <unk> and <unk>
but anti - abortionists oppose such research because they worry that the development of therapies using fetal - tissue transplants could lead to an increase in abortions
<unk> <unk> assistant secretary for health said <unk> the ban on federal funding of fetal - tissue transplant research should be continued indefinitely
he said n the ban wo n't stop privately funded tissue - transplant research or federally funded fetal - tissue research that does n't involve transplants
<unk> officials say that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> will support <unk> <unk> ruling which will be issued soon in the form of a letter to the acting director of the <unk> institutes of <unk>
both <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> oppose federal funding for abortion as does <unk> <unk> except in cases where a woman life is threatened
the controversy began in n when the <unk> institutes of <unk> aware of the policy implications of its research asked for an <unk> review of its plan to implant fetal tissue into the brain of a patient suffering from <unk> disease
the department placed a moratorium on the research pending a review of scientific legal and ethical issues
a majority of an <unk> - appointed panel recommended late last year that the research continue under carefully controlled conditions but the issue became embroiled in politics as anti - abortion groups continued to oppose federal funding
the dispute has hampered the administration efforts to recruit prominent doctors n to fill prestigious posts at the helm of the <unk> and the centers for <unk> <unk>
several candidates have withdrawn their names from consideration after administration officials asked them for their views on abortion and fetal - tissue transplants
<unk> <unk> whom <unk> <unk> nominated to serve as surgeon general reportedly has assured the administration that she opposes abortion
<unk> <unk> is deputy director of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
some researchers have charged that the administration is imposing new ideological tests for top scientific posts
earlier this week <unk> <unk> tried to defuse these charges by stressing that candidates n to head the <unk> and the <unk> will be judged by standards of scientific and administrative excellence not politics
but the administration handling of the fetal - tissue transplant issue disturbs many scientists
when scientific progress moves into uncharted ground there has to be a role for society to make judgments about its applications says <unk> <unk> associate dean of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
the disturbing thing about this abortion issue is that the debate has become polarized so that no mechanism exists for finding a middle ground
<unk> is one of the few medical institutions conducting privately funded research on fetal - tissue transplants
but <unk> <unk> warns that <unk> <unk> ruling may discourage private funding
the unavailability of federal funds and the climate in which the decision was made certainly do n't provide any incentive for one of the more visible foundations to provide support he said
despite the flap over transplants federal funding of research involving fetal tissues will continue on a number of fronts
such research may ultimately result in the ability to regenerate damaged tissues or to turn off genes that cause cancer or to regulate genes that cause down syndrome the leading cause of mental retardation according to an <unk> summary
the <unk> currently spends about n million annually on fetal - tissue research out of a total research budget of <unk> billion

the stocks of banking concerns based in <unk> were n't helped much by the announcement traders said <unk> because many of those concerns have financial problems tied to their real - estate loan portfolios making them unattractive takeover targets

the warnings issued to at least n criminal defense attorneys in several major cities in the last week have led to an outcry by members of the organized bar who claim n the information is protected by attorney - client privilege
the <unk> warnings stem from a <unk> law that requires anyone who receives more than <unk> in cash from a client or customer in one or more related transactions in the course of trade or business to report the payment on a document known as <unk> <unk>
the form asks for such details as the client name <unk> <unk> number passport number and details about the services provided for the payment
failure to complete the form had been punishable as a misdemeanor until last <unk> when <unk> determined that the crime was a felony punishable by up to n years in prison
attorneys have argued since <unk> when the law took effect that they can not provide information about clients who do n't wish their identities to be known
many attorneys have returned incomplete forms to the <unk> in recent years citing attorney - client privilege
until last week the <unk> rarely acted on the incomplete forms
this form forces a lawyer to become in effect a witness against his client said <unk> <unk> <unk> president of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> lawyers
the <unk> is asking lawyers to red - flag a criminal problem to the government added <unk> <unk> a <unk> lawyer who has heard from dozens of attorneys who received letters in recent days and has himself received the computer - generated <unk> forms sent by certified mail
<unk> <unk> said that clients who pay cash may include alleged drug dealers who do n't have domestic bank accounts
these individuals may not necessarily be under investigation when they hire lawyers
<unk> <unk> said n there also may be other circumstances under which individuals would n't want the government to know n they had retained criminal defense lawyers
filling out detailed forms about these individuals would tip the <unk> off and spark action against the clients he said n
the defense lawyers group formed a task force this week chaired by <unk> <unk> attorney <unk> <unk> <unk> to deal with the matter
the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of delegates passed a resolution in <unk> condemning the <unk> reporting requirement
<unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> lawyer who heads the <unk> grand jury committee said that lawyers are prohibited by the <unk> code of ethics from disclosing information about a client except where a court orders it or to prevent the client from committing a criminal act that could result in death

at that meeting he said <unk> the <unk> <unk> assured him that enforcement procedures would n't be threatened against attorneys without further review and advance notice
<unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> officials opposed the <unk> <unk> moderate stance on the matter
but in the letters sent in recent days <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> computing center in <unk> told attorneys that failing to voluntarily submit the requested information could result in summons enforcement action being initiated
in some cases the <unk> asked for information dating back to forms n it received in <unk>
a spokesman for the <unk> confirmed that there has been correspondence mailed about incomplete n but he declined to say why the letters were sent to lawyers now
individuals familiar with the <unk> <unk> policy said that <unk> officials had n't any knowledge of the <unk> actions in the last week
lawyers worry that if they provide information about clients that data could quickly end up in the hands of prosecutors
prosecutors need court permission to obtain the tax returns of an individual or a business
but they have obtained <unk> forms without court permission and used the information to help develop criminal cases
some criminal lawyers speculated that the <unk> was sending the letters to test the issue
in a number of recent cases federal courts have refused to recognize attorneys assertions that information relating to fees from clients should be confidential

federal judges make <unk> annually in <unk> <unk> rejected a bill that would have increased their pay by n
<unk> <unk> <unk> said n it is unjust for judges to make what they do

<unk> <unk> top executive took the unusual step of publicly apologizing for his company making bids of just one yen for several local government projects while computer rival <unk> <unk> made a written apology for indulging in the same practice
meanwhile business and government leaders rebuked the computer makers and fretted about the broader statement n the companies actions make about japanese cutthroat pricing
<unk> said <unk> it bid the equivalent of less than a <unk> penny on three separate municipal contracts during the past two years
the company also disclosed that during that period it offered n yen or about <unk> for another contract
but <unk> <unk> no . n computer maker is n't alone
<unk> one of its largest domestic competitors said n it bid one yen in two separate public auctions since <unk>
in both cases <unk> lost the contract to <unk> which made the same bid and won a tie - breaking lottery
all the contracts were for computer - system-design contracts and involved no hardware or software
the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> summoned executives from the companies to make sure n they understood the concern about such practices according to a government spokesman

the bids he added n were contrary to common sense
<unk> released a statement saying we feel sorry for having caused trouble to society a form of apology common in <unk> for companies caught in embarrassing situations
japanese companies have long had a reputation for sacrificing short - term profits to make a sale that may have long - term benefits
but the growing controversy comes as many practices historically accepted as normal here such as politicians accepting substantial gifts from businessmen or having extramarital affairs are coming under close ethical scrutiny
the fire is also fueled by growing international interest in japanese behavior
so far there have been no public overseas complaints about the issue
but in one of the auctions in question <unk> <unk> machines <unk> made a bid substantially higher than the <unk> offer according to the municipality
the low - ball bids touch on issues central to the increasingly tense trade debate
foreigners complain that they have limited access to government procurement in <unk> in part because japanese companies unfairly undercut them
the <unk> government in recent years has accused japanese companies of excessively slashing prices on semiconductors and supercomputers products n <unk> and <unk> make
asked whether the bidding flap would hurt u.s.-japan relations <unk> <unk> said this will be a minus factor
the one - yen controversy first came to a head last week when the city of <unk> announced that <unk> won a contract to design a computer system n to map its waterworks
the city had expected to pay about n million yen <unk> but <unk> essentially offered to do it for free
then <unk> <unk> said n it made a similar bid to win a library contract in <unk> prefecture two weeks earlier
it also said that in <unk> it bid <unk> yen to design a system for the <unk> prefectural library and two years ago it bid one yen to plan the telecommunications system for <unk> prefecture
the company said n it has offered to withdraw its bids in <unk> and <unk>
the municipalities said n they have n't decided whether to try to force the company to go through with the contracts
<unk> and <unk> said n they were still investigating and that knowledge of more such bids could emerge
<unk> <unk> insisted that headquarters had n't approved the bids and that he did n't know about most of the cases until <unk>

in <unk> the custom - chip maker said n excess capacity and lagging billings would result in an estimated n million to n million net loss for the third quarter
but company officials said yesterday that they decided to take a n million pretax charge for the period to cover a restructuring of world - wide manufacturing operations citing extended weakness in the market as well as a decision to switch to more economical production techniques
over the summer months there has been a slowing in the rate of new orders from the computer sector our primary market said <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman and chief executive officer
in addition recent industry forecasts for n indicate a slow environment at least until midyear
as a result the company said <unk> it decided to phase out its oldest capacity and make appropriate reductions in operating expenses
the n million net loss equals n cents a share
not counting the extraordinary charge the company said n it would have had a net loss of n million or seven cents a share
a year earlier it had profit of n million or n cents a share
revenue rose <unk> to n million from n million
the charge partly reflects a switch from older five - inch to more - efficient six - inch silicon wafers with which to fabricate chips
related to that decision the company said <unk> it was converting its <unk> <unk> <unk> factory to a research and development facility
a spokesman declined to speculate about possible reductions in force
this is a company that has invested in capacity additions more aggressively than any other company in the industry and now the industry is growing more slowly and they are suddenly poorly positioned said <unk> <unk> chip analyst at <unk> <unk> <unk>
i think n the stock is dead money for a while
yesterday announcement was made after markets closed
<unk> chip makers are facing continued slack demand following a traditionally slow summer
part of the problem is that chip buyers are keeping inventories low because of jitters about the course of the <unk> economy

the dollar posted gains against all major currencies yesterday buoyed by persistent japanese demand for <unk> bond issues
while market sentiment remains cautiously bearish on the dollar based on sluggish <unk> economic indicators dealers note that japanese demand has helped underpin the dollar against the yen and has kept the <unk> currency from plunging below key levels against the mark
at the same time dealers said <unk> the <unk> unit has been locked into a relatively narrow range in recent weeks in part because the hefty japanese demand for dollars has been offset by the mark strength resulting in a stalemate
<unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> reasons that while the mark has posted significant gains against the yen as well the mark climbed to n yen from <unk> yen late <unk> in <unk> <unk> the strength of the <unk> bond market compared to its foreign counterparts has helped lure investors to dollar - denominated bonds rather than mark bonds
<unk> - <unk> trade is the driving force in the market said <unk> <unk> a vice president with <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> but i not convinced <unk> it will continue
who knows what will happen down the road in three to six months if foreign investment starts to erode

<unk> <unk> a corporate trader with <unk> of <unk> in <unk> <unk> traced the dollar recent solid performance against the yen to purchases of securities by japanese insurance companies and trust banks and the sense that another wave of investment is waiting in the wings
he contends that the perception in <unk> of a vitriolic <unk> response to <unk> <unk> announcement of its purchase of <unk> pictures <unk> <unk> has been temporarily mollified
he cites the recent deal between the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> as well as the possible white knight role of an undisclosed japanese company in the <unk> - <unk> <unk> takeover bid for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as evidence
the forthcoming maturity in <unk> of a <unk> japanese government yen - denominated bond issue valued at about <unk> billion has prompted speculation in the market that investors redeeming the bonds will diversify into dollar - denominated instruments according to <unk> <unk>
it remains unclear whether the bond issue will be rolled over
meanwhile traders in <unk> say that the prospect of lower <unk> interest rates has spurred dollar buying by japanese institutions
they point out that these institutions want to lock in returns on high - yield <unk> <unk> debt and suggest n demand for the <unk> unit will continue unabated until rates in the <unk> recede
the market again showed little interest in further evidence of a slowing <unk> economy and traders note that the market in recent weeks has taken its cues more from <unk> <unk> than <unk> economic indicators
dealers said <unk> the dollar merely drifted lower following the release <unk> of the <unk> purchasing managers report
the managers index which measures the health of the manufacturing sector stood at <unk> in <unk> above <unk> n and also above average forecasts for the index of <unk>

but some of the tv stations that bought <unk> reruns for record prices two years ago are n't laughing much these days
the reruns have helped ratings at many of the <unk> network affiliates and independent tv stations that air the shows
but the ratings are considerably below expectations and some stations say n they may not buy new episodes when their current contracts expire
meanwhile stations are fuming because many of them say <unk> the show distributor <unk> <unk> is giving an ultimatum either sign new long - term commitments to buy future episodes or risk losing <unk> to a competitor
at the same time <unk> is trying to persuade stations to make commitments to a different world a spin - off of <unk> whose reruns will become available in <unk>

<unk> move comes as the syndication market is being flooded with situation comedies that are still running on the networks

in this era of frantic competition for ad dollars a lot of revenue - desperate magazines are getting pretty cozy with advertisers fawning over them in articles and offering pages of advertorial space
so can a magazine survive by downright thumbing its nose at major advertisers

founded by <unk> <unk> publishing entrepreneur <unk> <unk> <unk> made its debut this fall with the promise to give consumers the straight scoop on the <unk> waste crisis
the magazine combines how - to pieces on topics like backyard composting explanatory essays on such things as what happens after you flush your toilet and hard - hitting pieces on alleged environmental offenders
garbage editors have dumped considerable energy into a whirling rampage through supermarket aisles in a bid to identify corporate <unk> good guys and bad boys
in one feature called in the dumpster editors point out a product n they deem to be a particularly bad offender
from an advertising standpoint the problem is n these offenders are likely to be some of the same folks that are major magazine advertisers these days
with only two issues under its belt <unk> has alienated some would - be advertisers and raised the ire of others
<unk> <unk> for one is furious <unk> its <unk> <unk> microwave product was chastised in the premiere in the dumpster column
the magazine editors ran a giant diagram of the product with arrows pointing to the packaging polystyrene foam polyproplene and polyester film all plastic items n they say n are non - biodegradable

i think that this magazine is not only called garbage but it is practicing journalistic garbage fumes a spokesman for <unk> <unk>
he says <unk> <unk> was n't even contacted by the magazine for the opportunity to comment
modifications had been made to the <unk> <unk> product at the time n the issue was printed he says n making it less an offender than was portrayed

you really need the <unk> <unk> of the world to be interested in your magazine if you going to make a run of it says <unk> <unk> senior vice president and media director at <unk> <unk> <unk>
the economics of magazine publishing pretty much require that you have a pretty solid base of big - time ad spenders he adds n
the first two issues featured ads from only a handful of big advertisers including <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> but the majority were from companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> international firms that do n't spend much money advertising and ca n't be relied on to support a magazine over the long haul
a <unk> <unk> spokeswoman says <unk> its ad in the premiere issue was a one - time purchase and n it does n't have any plans to advertise in future issues
we do n't spend much on print advertising she says

we are able to increase our price above the n level if necessary
he declined to say however how much <unk> containers might raise its price
<unk> <unk> speculated that the leeway that <unk> containers has means that <unk> would have to substantially increase their bid if they going to top us
<unk> however harshly criticized <unk> containers plan yesterday characterizing it as a highly conditional device designed to entrench management confuse shareholders and prevent them from accepting our superior cash offer
a spokesman for <unk> estimated that <unk> containers plan if all the asset sales materialize would result in shareholders receiving only <unk> to n a share in cash
the lower figures the spokesman said n would stem from preferred shares being converted to common stock and the possibility that <unk> <unk> subsidiaries might be required to place their shares in the open market

the <unk> <unk> auto makers said n the rule changes were n't surprising because <unk> administration officials have long said n they planned to impose car safety standards on light trucks and vans
safety advocates including some members of <unk> have been urging the department for years to extend car - safety requirements to light trucks and vans which now account for almost one - third of all vehicle sales in the <unk>
they say that many vehicles classed as commercial light trucks actually carry more people than cargo and therefore should have the same safety features as cars

when <unk> <unk> proprietor of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> announced a n price tag for his <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> this fall few wine shops and restaurants around the country balked
this is the peak of my wine - making experience <unk> <unk> declared when he introduced the wine at a dinner in <unk> <unk> and i wanted to single it out as such
it is in my estimation the best wine <unk> <unk> <unk> has produced and with fewer than <unk> cases available it is sure to sell quickly
the price is a new high for <unk> <unk> <unk> but it is not the highest
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> weighed in this fall with a sticker price of <unk> a bottle
one of the fastest growing segments of the wine market is the category of superpremiums wines limited in production of exceptional quality or so perceived at any rate and with exceedingly high prices
for years this group included a stable of classics <unk> first growths <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> burgundies <unk> - <unk> and <unk> <unk> deluxe champagnes <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> rarefied sweet wines <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> from <unk> and <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk>
these first magnitude wines ranged in price from <unk> to n a bottle
in the last year or so however this exclusive club has taken in a host of flashy new members
the classics have zoomed in price to meet the competition and it almost seems that there a race on to come up with the priciest single bottle among current releases from every major wine region on the globe
<unk> can boast the lion share of high - priced bottles
<unk> first growths from <unk> and <unk> are <unk> to n each except for the smallest in terms of production <unk> <unk> which costs around <unk>
these prices seem rather modest however in light of other french wines from current vintages
<unk> <unk> the leading <unk> now goes for well over <unk> a bottle for a lighter vintage like n the spectacularly rich <unk> runs n
in <unk> some of the prestige cuvees are inching toward <unk> a bottle
the first <unk> <unk> to crack that price barrier was the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> de <unk>
the <unk> <unk> is <unk>
<unk> <unk> at <unk> a bottle sells out around the country and <unk> <unk> de <unk> <unk> de <unk> is encroaching upon that level
the great reds of the <unk> <unk> have soared in price as well
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for example is <unk>
none of <unk> wine regions can steal a march on <unk> however
the six wines of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> - <unk> <unk> of the most precious acres of vineyard anywhere in the world have commanded three - digit price tags for several years now
with the n vintage they soared higher <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> - <unk> <unk>
another small <unk> estate <unk> - <unk> has just offered its <unk> <unk> - <unk> for n
from <unk> there is <unk> <unk> <unk> at <unk> a bottle <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a n cabernet from <unk> and <unk> - <unk> <unk> at <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> released only in its <unk> year is <unk> as is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
there are certain cult wines that can command these higher prices says <unk> <unk> of <unk> one of the largest wine shops in <unk>
what different is that it is happening with young wines just coming out
we seeing it partly because older vintages are growing more scarce
wine auctions have almost exhausted the limited supply of those wines <unk> <unk> continued <unk> we seen a dramatic decrease in demand for wines from the <unk> and <unk> which go for n to n a bottle
some of the newer wines even at <unk> to n a bottle or so almost offer a bargain
take <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk>
it made only in years when the grapes ripen perfectly the last was <unk> and comes from a single acre of grapes that yielded a mere n cases in <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> originally planned to sell it for <unk> a bottle but when a retailer in <unk> <unk> asked is that wholesale or retail he re - thought the matter
offering the wine at roughly <unk> a bottle wholesale n retail he sent merchants around the country a form asking them to check one of three answers n no the wine is too high <unk> responses n yes it high but i take it n responses <unk> i take all <unk> i can get <unk> responses
the wine was shipped in six - bottle cases instead of the usual n but even at that it was spread thin going to n retailers in n states
we thought n it was awfully expensive said <unk> <unk> wine director at <unk> in <unk> <unk> one of the top stores in suburban <unk> but there are people out there with very different opinions of value
we got our two six - packs and they gone
<unk> <unk> remarked that he thinks n steeper prices have come about because producers do n't like to see a hit wine dramatically increase in price later on
even if there is consumer resistance at first a wine that wins high ratings from the critics will eventually move
there may be sticker - shock reaction initially said <unk> <unk> but as the wine is talked about and starts to sell they eventually get excited and decide n it worth the astronomical price to add it to their collection
it just sort of a one - upsmanship thing with some people added <unk> <unk>
they like to talk about having the new <unk> <unk> <unk> one of <unk> <unk> cabernets or the <unk> <unk> <unk> or the <unk>
producers have seen this market opening up and they now creating wines that appeal to these people
that explains why the number of these wines is expanding so rapidly
but consumers who buy at this level are also more knowledgeable than they were a few years ago
they wo n't buy if the quality is not there said <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
or if they feel n the wine is overpriced and n they can get something equally good for less
<unk> <unk> has increased prices on some wines like <unk> <unk> <unk> now n just to slow down movement but he is beginning to see some resistance to high - priced red burgundies and cabernets and chardonnays in the <unk> to n range
image has of course a great deal n to do with what sells and what does n't and it ca n't be forced
wine merchants ca n't keep <unk> <unk> in stock but they have to push <unk> <unk> <unk> even lowering the price from <unk> to n
it hardly a question of quality the <unk> <unk> is a beautiful wine but as <unk> <unk> noted n people have their own ideas about value
it interesting to find that a lot of the expensive wines are n't always walking out the door
in every major market in the <unk> for instance you can buy <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> virtually all of the first growth <unk> except <unk> as well as <unk> one and <unk> from <unk> and at the moment the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
with the biggest wine - buying period of the year looming as the holidays approach it will be interesting to see how the superpremiums fare
by <unk> it should be fairly clear what hot and what not

signs of a slowing economy are increasing pressure on the <unk> <unk> to cut short - term interest rates but it is n't clear whether the central bank will do so
a survey by the <unk> n district banks shows n economic growth has been sluggish in recent weeks while upward pressures on prices have moderated
the economy is clearly slowing says <unk> <unk> president of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
if you look at the third quarter as posting roughly <unk> growth i do see some slowing in the fourth quarter agrees <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
nevertheless both <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> say <unk> the slowdown so far is no cause for concern
we coming closer to achieving the stated objective of slowing the economy to a point where hopefully some downward trend in prices will occur said <unk> <unk>
<unk> administration officials are looking to the <unk> to bring down rates and financial markets seem to be expecting easier credit as well
i think n the market had been expecting the <unk> to ease sooner and a little more than it has to date said <unk> <unk> vice president of global markets for <unk> <unk> <unk>
the <unk> cut the key federal funds interest rate by about n percentage point to <unk> after the <unk> n stock market plunge but has shown no sign of movement since
the report from the <unk> found that manufacturing in particular has been weak in recent weeks
the <unk> <unk> for instance reported that manufacturing activity continues to decline for the fourth month in a row
and in the <unk> district the report said <unk> a manufacturer of capital goods noted slower orders for some types including defense equipment petroleum equipment food packaging machinery and material handling equipment
retail sales also were reported slow in most districts particularly for discretionary big - ticket items such as furniture home appliances and consumer electronics
and construction also was described as slow in most areas
despite the economic slowdown there are few clear signs that growth is coming to a halt
as a result <unk> officials may be divided over whether to ease credit
several <unk> governors in <unk> have been pushing for easier credit but many of the regional <unk> presidents have been resisting such a move
<unk> <unk> said <unk> he is pleased with the economy recent performance and does n't see a lot of excesses out there that would tilt us into recession
there is always a chance of recession added <unk> <unk> but if you ask me to put a percentage on it i would think n it well below a n chance

unless it can raise money in financial markets <unk> <unk> said <unk> the federal government wo n't have the cash n to pay off n billion in <unk> bills that mature on <unk>
without congressional action the <unk> ca n't sell any new securities even savings bonds
but despite partisan bickering over the debt ceiling which has become entangled in the fight over cutting capital - gains taxes <unk> is almost certain to act in time n to avoid default
each day that <unk> fails to act will cause additional disruption in our borrowing schedule possibly resulting in higher interest costs to the taxpayer <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said in a speech prepared for delivery last night to a group of bankers
to avoid these costs and a possible default immediate action is imperative
the securities n to be sold next week will raise about <unk> billion in cash and redeem n billion in maturing notes

none of the securities will be eligible for when - issued trading until <unk> approves an increase in the debt ceiling clearing the way for a formal offering <unk> <unk> said <unk>
the <unk> said <unk> it needs to raise n billion in the current quarter in order to end <unk> with a n billion cash balance
auctions held in <unk> and those scheduled for next week will raise a total of n billion
the remaining n billion could be raised through the sale of short - term <unk> bills two - year notes in <unk> and five - year notes in early <unk> the <unk> said n

however the junk - bond market has collapsed in recent weeks lessening the likelihood that such a transaction would succeed
now he said <unk> the group plans to put in several hundred million dollars in equity and finance the remainder with bank debt
he also said that the group reduced its offer because it was n't allowed to see <unk> <unk> confidential financial information without agreeing that it would n't make an offer unless it had <unk> <unk> consent

criticism in the <unk> over recent japanese acquisitions is looming ever larger in the two countries relations
officials from both nations say <unk> the <unk> public skittishness about japanese investment could color a second round of bilateral economic talks scheduled for next week in <unk>
not that <unk> and <unk> disagree on the japanese acquisitions indeed each has come out in favor of unfettered investment in the <unk>
where they disagree is on the subject of <unk> direct investment in <unk>
the <unk> wants the removal of what it perceives as barriers to investment <unk> denies n there are real barriers
the heated talk stirred up by recent japanese investments in the <unk> is focusing attention on the differences in investment climate even though it only one of many subjects n to be covered in the bilateral talks known as the <unk> impediments <unk>
the japanese should see this rhetoric as a signal of the need for a change in their own economy says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> assistant <unk> secretary who has been in <unk> this week informally discussing the impending negotiations with government and business leaders
we have a long history of maintaining an open direct - investment policy <unk> <unk> says
<unk> investors should have a greater opportunity at direct investment in <unk>
the japanese fret openly about the <unk> public rancor
one clear sign of <unk> nervousness came this week when a spokesman for <unk> <unk> <unk> devoted nearly all of a regular half - hour briefing for foreign journalists to the subject of recent japanese investments in the <unk>
we believe that it is vitally important for those japanese business interests in the <unk> to be more aware of the emotions and concerns of the american people said the spokesman <unk> <unk>
at the same time though he chastised the media for paying such close attention to japanese investment when other foreign countries notably <unk> are acquiring more american assets
fears that japanese investors are buying up <unk> have escalated sharply in the past several weeks with <unk> <unk> purchase of <unk> pictures <unk> <unk> from <unk> - <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> acquisition of a n holding in <unk> <unk> the owner of some of midtown <unk> most exclusive real estate
even before those moves added fuel the fires of discontent had been well stoked by the highly publicized experience in <unk> of one <unk> investor <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>

the <unk> <unk> <unk> chaired by a fellow <unk> democratic <unk> <unk> <unk> last month urged <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to use <unk> <unk> experience in talks with <unk> to highlight this problem facing americans who seek access to the japanese capital markets
while <unk> <unk> and japanese officials say <unk> the question of investors access to the <unk> and japanese markets may get a disproportionate share of the public attention a number of other important economic issues will be on the table at next week talks
among them are differences in savings and investment rates corporate structures and management and government spending
each side has a litany of recommendations for the other
the <unk> says n it is anxious for results
we feel very strongly that we really need action across the full range of issues n we identified and we need it by next spring <unk> <unk> says
both sides have agreed that the talks will be most successful if negotiators start by focusing on the areas that can be most easily changed
but they have n't clarified what those might be
after the first set of meetings two months ago some <unk> officials complained that <unk> had n't come up with specific changes n it was prepared to make
the japanese retort that the first round was too early to make concessions
just to say n the distribution system is wrong does n't mean anything says a <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> official
we need to clarify what exactly is wrong with it
that process of sorting out specifics is likely to take time the japanese say n no matter how badly the <unk> wants quick results
for instance at the first meeting the two sides could n't even agree on basic data used in price discussions
since then a team of about <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> officials have crossed the globe gauging consumer prices
by <unk> they hope to have a sheaf of documents n both sides can trust
little by little there is progress says the <unk> official
both sides are taking action

the deal also gave <unk> access to a high - tech medical product
they view this as a growth area so they went about it with a systematic approach says <unk> <unk> a <unk> vice president
indeed for many japanese trading companies the favorite <unk> small business is one whose research and development can be milked for future japanese use
the japanese companies bankroll many small <unk> companies with promising products or ideas frequently putting their money behind projects that commercial banks wo n't touch
japanese companies have financed small and medium - sized <unk> firms for years but in recent months the pace has taken off
in the first half of n alone japanese corporations invested n million in minority positions in <unk> companies a <unk> rise from the figure for all of <unk> reports <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>

in investing on the basis of future transactions a role often performed by merchant banks trading companies can cut through the logjam that small - company owners often face with their local commercial banks

they want assets they want a balance sheet which has no relation to the business n a company can generate

for n years <unk> <unk> went to her neighborhood bank because it was convenient
a high - balance customer that banks pine for she did n't give much thought to the rates n she was receiving nor to the fees n she was paying
but in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> introduced its <unk> <unk> a package designed to lure customers such as <unk> <unk>
among other things it included checking safe deposit box and credit card all for free plus a good deal on installment loans
all n she had to do was put <unk> in a certificate of deposit or qualify for a <unk> personal line of credit
i deserve something for my loyalty she says
she took her business to <unk> <unk>
so it goes in the competitive world of consumer banking these days
for nearly a decade banks have competed for customers primarily with the interest rates n they pay on their deposits and charge on their loans
the competitive rates were generally offset by hefty fees on various services
but many banks are turning away from strict price competition
instead they are trying to build customer loyalty by bundling their services into packages and targeting them to small segments of the population
you dead in the water if you are n't segmenting the market says <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> <unk> a bank consulting firm in <unk>
<unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> recently introduced its <unk> <unk> <unk> aimed at young adults just starting careers
the program not only offers a pre - approved car loan up to <unk> but throws in a special cash - flow statement n to help in saving money
in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> launched the <unk> account a package designed for the thirtysomething crowd with services that include a credit card and line of credit with no annual fees and a full percentage point off on installment loans
the theory such individuals many with young children are in their prime borrowing years and having borrowed from the bank they may continue to use it for other services in later years
for some time banks have been aiming packages at the elderly the demographic segment with the highest savings
those efforts are being stepped up
<unk> <unk> vice president of retail sales at <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> says <unk> the company now targets sub - segments within the market by tailoring its popular seniors partners <unk> to various life styles
varying age geography and life - style differences create numerous sub - markets <unk> <unk> says

an active n in <unk> <unk> may care more about <unk> <unk> games while a n in <unk> <unk> may care more about a seminar on health she says
banks have tried packaging before
in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> launched the <unk> <unk> which included free checking a credit card safe - deposit box and travelers checks for a <unk> monthly fee
the concept begot a slew of copycats but the banks stopped promoting the packages
one big reason thin margins
many banks particularly smaller ones were slow to computerize and could n't target market niches that would have made the programs more profitable
as banks earnings were squeezed in the <unk> the emphasis switched to finding ways n to cut costs
but now computers are enabling more banks to analyze their customers by age income and geography
they are better able to get to those segments in the wake of the deregulation that began in the late <unk>
deregulation has effectively removed all restrictions on what banks can pay for deposits as well as opened up the field for new products such as high - rate cds
where a bank once offered a standard passbook savings account it began offering money - market accounts certificates of deposit and interest - bearing checking and staggering rates based on the size of deposits
the competition has grown more intense as bigger banks such as <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> extend their market - share battles into small towns across the nation
today a banker is worrying about local regional and money - center banks as well as thrifts and credit unions says <unk> <unk> at <unk> <unk>
so people who were n't even thinking about targeting n years ago are scrambling to define their customer base
the competition has cultivated a much savvier consumer
the average household will spread n accounts over a dozen financial institutions says <unk> <unk> <unk> who runs his own bank consulting firm in <unk> <unk>
this much fragmentation makes attracting and keeping today rate - sensitive customers costly
packages encourage loyalty by rewarding customers for doing the bulk of their banking in one place
for their troubles the banks get a larger captive audience that is less likely to move at the drop of a rate
the more accounts n customers have <unk> <unk> says n the more likely they are to be attracted to a package and to be loyal to the bank that offers it
that can pay off down the road as customers especially the younger ones change from borrowers to savers\/investors
packaging has some drawbacks
the additional technology personnel training and promotional effort can be expensive
<unk> <unk> spent more than n million to introduce its <unk> line several packages aimed at different segments in <unk> according to <unk> <unk> senior vice president of marketing
it not easy to roll out something that comprehensive and make it pay <unk> <unk> says
still bankers expect packaging to flourish primarily because more customers are demanding that financial services be tailored to their needs
these days banking customers walk in the door expecting you to have a package especially for them <unk> <unk> says
some banks are already moving in that direction according to <unk> <unk> sale marketing director at <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>
<unk> <unk> he says <unk> now has packages for seven customer groups
soon it will split those into <unk>
says <unk> <unk> i think n more banks are starting to realize that we have to be more like the department store not the boutique
iras
<unk> <unk> said n it will amend a registration statement filed with the securities and <unk> <unk> to delete a plan to sell <unk> newly issued common shares
the <unk> <unk> company said n it will resubmit the registration n to cover only the n million warrants each exercisable for the purchase of one common share
currently <unk> has about n million common shares outstanding
<unk> develops and markets low - cost software peripheral equipment and accessories for computers
five things n you can do for n or less
n buy a new <unk>
n take a hawaiian vacation
n send your child to a university
n buy a diamond necklace
n make a lasting difference in the regulatory life of an american savings - and-loan association through the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
americans today spend n like pocket change they do n't think much about it
but for an ailing savings - and-loan association teetering on insolvency it can lead to safety from imminent demise and to a future full of promise
your n will help keep a needy savings and loan solvent and out of the federal budget deficit
as a <unk> <unk> <unk> you be helping a neighborhood s&l in areas crucial to its survival
like healthy regulatory capital
a steady deposit base
performing loans
at the same time you give your <unk> <unk> <unk> the gift of hope and freedom from the federal regulators who want to close its doors for good
as a <unk> <unk> <unk> you will experience the same joy felt by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and others who find ways n to help troubled savings institutions and their employees help themselves
that builds confidence self sufficiency not to mention critical regulatory net worth
do n't wait a savings institution needs your help now
every day n you delay a savings institution health and the federal budget deficit grows worse
think about the good n you can do for just n a month about the cost of a mid - size <unk> or two semesters at a state university
then send your support to a savings institution that has taken a bad rap in the press and on its bottom line
every n n you send will go a long way to boost sagging net worth and employee morale and keep your <unk> <unk> <unk> off the federal budget deficit
<unk> <unk> is a lawyer in <unk> <unk>
the <unk> <unk> <unk> said n it plans to institute an additional circuit breaker aimed at stemming market slides
separately <unk> <unk> told a closed <unk> subcommittee meeting in <unk> that he would support securities and <unk> <unk> halts of program trading during market emergencies
but the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman said <unk> he does n't support reinstating a collar on program trading arguing that firms could get around such a limit
the <unk> <unk> said <unk> a new one - hour price limit would take effect in its <unk> <unk> <unk> stock - index futures pit once <unk> <unk> futures fell n index points the equivalent of about a n drop in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
if the <unk> limit is triggered after <unk> p.m <unk> time it would remain in effect until the normal close of trading at <unk> p.m
with the limit in effect members would be able to execute trades at the limit price or at higher prices but not below it
the exchange said <unk> it decided n a new circuit breaker was needed following a review of the tumultuous trading in stocks and stock - index futures on <unk> <unk> n when the <unk> <unk> industrials plunged <unk> points and stock - index futures prices skidded as well
late that afternoon the <unk> <unk> stock - index futures contract fell a total of <unk> index points hitting a <unk> circuit breaker limit that remained in effect for the rest of the trading session
the <unk> said that its existing n n limit on <unk> n stock - index futures trading equal to about n points on the <unk> <unk> industrials which was triggered <unk> n will remain in effect
<unk> <unk> <unk> executive committee chairman said that the <unk> limit appeared to lessen the selling panic <unk> n
but when the contract reopened the subsequent flood of sell orders that quickly knocked the contract down to the <unk> limit indicated that the intermediate limit of <unk> points was needed to help keep stock and stock - index futures prices synchronized
several traders maintained that the <unk> <unk> circuit - breaker aggravated the market slide <unk> n by directing additional selling pressure to the floor of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
all of the changes require regulatory approval which is expected shortly
the exchange also said that the <unk> circuit breaker which currently provides only a one - hour respite during market sell - offs will become the maximum one - day limit for the <unk> <unk> stock - index futures contract the one - day limit now is <unk> index points
a final modification was made to the five - point opening limit for the contract
the <unk> said <unk> that five - point limit will remain in effect for the first n minutes of trading
the limit lapses under current exchange rules if contracts trade above the limit price during the opening n minutes of trading
in <unk> <unk> aides said <unk> <unk> <unk> told congressmen that the collar which banned program trades through the <unk> <unk> computer when the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> moved <unk> points did n't work well
he said that firms could get around the collar by executing trades manually
in a post - hearing news conference <unk> <unk> who has publicly expressed concern about market volatility said <unk> he told the <unk> finance and telecommunications subcommittee that he would support the program - trading halt proposal providing n the <unk> would be comfortable with the language in a bill
the program - trading issue is heating up on <unk> <unk> as it is on <unk> <unk> and several legislators want to grant the <unk> the power to shut off the programs when trading becomes too volatile
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has said n he would be willing to consider circuit breakers that have preset trigger points but he does n't want discretionary power to stop programs
a <unk> aide suggested that <unk> <unk> was so vague and mushy that it was the kind of meeting where people of all viewpoints could come out feeling good
at one point <unk> <unk> angered the subcommittee chairman <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by not going much beyond what already had been reported in the morning newspapers
<unk> said n we could have done this in public because so little sensitive information was disclosed the aide said <unk>
<unk> <unk> then responded that he would have been happy just writing a report to the panel the aide added <unk>
at another point during the hearing <unk> <unk> asked <unk> <unk> what would be discussed at a <unk> <unk> exchange board meeting today
<unk> <unk> said <unk> the <unk> <unk> is likely to study the program - trading issue
that response annoyed <unk> <unk> <unk> aides said <unk> and the congressman snapped back that there had been enough studies of the issue and that it was time for action on the matter
fifteen of the <unk> subcommittee members attended the hearing most notably <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the full <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> chairman who has been willing to let <unk> <unk> carry the legislation in recent months
<unk> <unk> expressed concern sources said <unk> about jurisdictional problems in regulating program trading which uses futures to offset stock trades
the futures industry is regulated by the <unk> futures <unk> <unk> which reports to the <unk> committees in both houses
the art of change - ringing is peculiar to the <unk> and like most english peculiarities unintelligible to the rest of the world
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> tailors
<unk>
of all scenes that evoke rural <unk> this is one of the loveliest an ancient stone church stands amid the fields the sound of bells cascading from its tower calling the faithful to evensong
the parishioners of <unk> <unk> and all angels stop to chat at the church door as members here always have
in the tower five men and women pull rhythmically on ropes attached to the same five bells that first sounded here in <unk>
but there is also a discordant modern note in <unk> though it ca n't be heard by the church - goers enjoying the peal of bells this cool autumn evening
like most of the other <unk> churches in <unk> with sets of bells <unk> <unk> once had its own band of ringers who would herald every <unk> morning and evening service
now only one local ringer remains <unk> <unk> <unk>
the others here today live elsewhere
they belong to a group of <unk> ringers including two octogenarians and four youngsters in training who drive every <unk> from church to church in a sometimes - exhausting effort to keep the bells sounding in the many belfries of <unk> <unk>
to ring for even one service at this tower we have to scrape says <unk> <unk> a retired water - authority worker
we tried to train the youngsters but they have their discos and their dances and they just drift away
<unk> <unk> worries that old age and the flightiness of youth will diminish the ranks of the <unk> <unk> group that keeps the <unk> bells pealing
history after all is not on his side
according to a nationwide survey taken a year ago nearly a third of <unk> church bells are no longer rung on sundays because there is no one n to ring them
it is easy to see why the ancient art is on the ropes
the less complicated version of playing tunes on bells as do the carillons of continental <unk> is considered by the <unk> to be childish fit only for foreigners
change - ringing a mind - boggling exercise n the <unk> invented n years ago requires physical dexterity some bells weigh more than a ton combined with intense mental concentration
proper english bells are started off in rounds from the highest - pitched bell to the lowest a simple descending scale using in larger churches as many as n bells
then at a signal the ringers begin varying the order in which the bells sound without altering the steady rhythm of the striking
each variation or change can occur only once the rules state n
ringers memorize patterns of changes known as methods which have odd - sounding names like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> caters
a series of <unk> or so changes is a peal and takes about three hours
a look at a <unk> night practice at <unk> <unk> <unk> church in the <unk> district of <unk> gives an idea of the work involved
ten shirt - sleeved ringers stand in a circle one foot ahead of the other in a prize - fighter stance each pulling a rope that disappears through a small hole in the high ceiling of the ringing chamber
no one speaks and the snaking of the ropes seems to make as much sound as the bells themselves muffled by the ceiling
totally absorbed the ringers stare straight ahead using peripheral vision they call it rope - sight to watch the other ropes and thus time their pulls
far above in the belfry the huge bronze bells mounted on wheels swing madly through a full n degrees starting and ending surprisingly in the inverted or mouth - up position
skilled ringers use their wrists to advance or retard the next swing so that one bell can swap places with another in the following change
in a well - known detective - story involving church bells <unk> novelist <unk> <unk> <unk> described ringing as a passion that finds its satisfaction in mathematical completeness and mechanical perfection
ringers she added n are filled with the solemn intoxication that comes of intricate ritual faultlessly performed
ringing does become a bit of an obsession admits <unk> <unk> master of the band at <unk> <unk> <unk> and one of <unk> best female ringers
it is a passion that usually stays in the tower however
more often than not ringers think of the church as something stuck on the bottom of the belfry
when their changes are completed and after they have worked up a sweat ringers often skip off to the local pub leaving worship for others below
this does not sit well with some clerics
with membership of the <unk> of <unk> steadily dwindling strong - willed vicars are pressing equally strong - willed and often non - religious ringers to attend services
two years ago the <unk> <unk> <unk> vicar of <unk> <unk> <unk> got so fed up with ringers who did n't attend service n he sacked the entire band the ringers promptly set up a picket line in protest
they were a self - perpetuating club that treated the tower as sort of a separate premises the <unk> <unk> says
an entirely new band rings today at <unk> <unk> several of whom are members of the congregation
but there still are n't enough ringers <unk> to ring more than six of the eight bells
at <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> the bells have fallen silent following a dust - up over church attendance
the vicar <unk> <unk> refuses to talk about it saying n it would reopen the wound
but <unk> <unk> vicar of a nearby church feels <unk> the fault is in the stairs from the bell tower that are located next to the altar
so crunch crunch crunch bang bang bang here come the ringers from above making a very obvious exit while the congregation is at prayer he says
<unk> <unk> admits to mixed feelings about this issue since he is both a vicar and an active bell - ringer himself
the sound of bells is a net n to draw people into the church he says
i live in hopes that the ringers themselves will be drawn into that fuller life
the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> ringers a sort of parliament of ringing groups aims to improve relations with vicars says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> president
it hopes to speak to students at theological colleges about the joys of bell ringing and will shortly publish a booklet for every vicar in the country entitled the bells in your care
says <unk> <unk> we recognize that we may no longer have as high a priority in church life and experience
<unk> <unk> is also attacking the greater problem lack of ringers
one survey says that of the <unk> trained bellringers in <unk> today only n of them still ring
also ringers do n't always live where the bells need to be rung like in small rural parishes and inner - city churches
but the council program to attract and train ringers is only partly successful says <unk> <unk> <unk>
right now we lucky if after five years we keep one new ringer out of <unk> he adds
one bright sign is that a growing number of women have entered the once male - dominated field more than a third of the ringers today are women
they are n't accepted everywhere however
the oldest bell - ringing group in the country the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> founded in <unk> remains male - only a fact that particularly galling to women because the group is the sole source of ringers for <unk> most prestigious churches <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
this being <unk> no woman has filed an equal - opportunity suit but the extent of the problem surfaced this summer in a series of letters to the <unk> <unk> a weekly newspaper for ringers
one writer signing his letter as <unk> - blooded balanced male remarked on the frequency of women fainting in peals and suggested that they settle back into their traditional role of making tea at meetings
in the torrent of replies that followed one woman ringer from <unk> observed that the average male ringer leaves quite a lot n to be desired badly dressed decorated with acne and a large beer - belly frequently unwashed and unbearably flatulent in peals
another women wrote from <unk> to say that in her n years of ringing i have never known a lady to faint in the belfry
i have seen one or two men die bless them
investors unsettled by the stock market gyrations can take some comfort in the predictable arrival of quarterly dividend checks
that has been particularly true this year with many companies raising their payouts more than n
but do n't breathe too easy those dividend increases may signal trouble ahead for stock prices some analysts warn <unk>
in the past they say n the strongest dividend growth has often come at times when the stock - market party was almost over
that can be a trap for unwary investors says <unk> <unk> <unk> senior quantitative analyst at <unk> <unk> <unk>
strong dividend growth he says <unk> is the black widow of valuation a reference to the female spiders that attract males and then kill them after mating
<unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> explains that companies raise their payouts most robustly only after the economy and corporate profits have been growing for some time
invariably those strong periods in the economy give way to recessionary environments he says
and recessionary environments are n't hospitable to the stock market
indeed analysts say that payouts have sometimes risen most sharply when prices were already on their way down from cyclical peaks
in <unk> for example dividends on the stocks in <unk> <unk> <unk> index soared n following much slower growth the year before
the <unk> index started sliding in price in <unk> n and fell <unk> in <unk> despite a <unk> expansion in dividends that year
that pattern has n't always held but recent strong growth in dividends makes some market watchers anxious
payouts on the <unk> <unk> stocks rose n in <unk> according to <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> estimates for n growth are generally between <unk> and <unk>
many people believe <unk> the growth in dividends will slow next year although a minority see double - digit gains continuing
meanwhile many market watchers say n recent dividend trends raise another warning flag while dividends have risen smartly their expansion has n't kept pace with even stronger advances in stock prices
as a result the market dividend yield dividends as a percentage of price has slid to a level that is fairly low and unenticing by historical standards
put another way the decline in the yield suggests <unk> stocks have gotten pretty rich in price relative to the dividends <unk> they pay some market analysts say n
they are keeping a close watch on the yield on the <unk> <unk>
the figure is currently about n up from <unk> before the recent market slide
some analysts say n investors should run for the exits if a sustained market rebound pushes the yield below <unk>
a drop below that <unk> benchmark has always been a strong warning sign that stocks are fully valued says <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>
in fact the market has always tanked
always
there never been an exception says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> investment adviser and money manager based on a review of six decades of stock - market data
the last time n the <unk> <unk> yield dropped below <unk> was in the summer of <unk>
stockholders who took the hint and sold shares escaped the <unk> debacle
there have been only seven other times in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> when the yield on the <unk> <unk> dropped below <unk> for at least two consecutive months <unk> <unk> found <unk>
and in each case he says n a sharp drop in stock prices began within a year
still some market analysts say n the current n reading is n't as troublesome as it might have been in years past
it not a very meaningful indicator currently because corporations are not behaving in a traditional manner says <unk> <unk> <unk> head of stock investments for <unk> <unk> the <unk> - based insurer
in particular <unk> <unk> says n businesses are paying out a smaller percentage of their profits and cash flow in the form of dividends than they have historically
so while stock prices may look fairly high relative to dividends they are not excessive relative to the underlying corporate strength
rather than increasing dividends some companies have used cash to buy back some of their shares notes <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> - chairman of the investment policy committee at <unk> <unk> <unk>
he factors that into the market yield to get an adjusted yield of about <unk>
that is just a tad below the average of the past <unk> years or so he says n
what will happen to dividend growth next year
common wisdom suggests a single - digit rate of growth reflecting a weakening in the economy and corporate profits
<unk> <unk> for instance is forecasting growth in <unk> <unk> dividends of just under <unk> in <unk> down from an estimated n this year
in other years in which there have been moderate economic slowdowns the environment n the firm expects in <unk> the change in dividends ranged from a gain of <unk> to a decline of <unk> according to <unk> analyst <unk> <unk>
the minority argument meanwhile is that businesses have the financial wherewithal this time around <unk> to declare sharply higher dividends even if their earnings weaken
dividend growth on the order of <unk> is expected by both <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
those dividend bulls argue that corporations are in the unusual position of having plenty of cash left over after paying dividends and making capital expenditures
one indicator <unk> investors might want to watch is the monthly tally from <unk> <unk> of the number of public companies adjusting their dividends
a total of n companies raised dividends in <unk> basically unchanged from <unk> a year ago <unk> said <unk> <unk>
that followed four straight months in which the number of increases trailed the year - earlier pace
while the <unk> tally does n't measure the magnitude of dividend changes a further slippage in the number of dividend increases could be a harbinger of slower dividend growth next year
in any case opinion is mixed on how much of a boost the overall stock market would get even if dividend growth continues at double - digit levels
<unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> estimates n the stock market will deliver a <unk> to n total return from appreciation and dividends over the next <unk> months vs. a cash rate of return of perhaps <unk> or <unk> if dividend growth is weak
but <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> who also expects n growth in dividends next year does n't think n it will help the overall market all that much
having the dividend increases is a supportive element in the market outlook but i do n't think n it a main consideration he says
with slower economic growth and flat corporate earnings likely next year i would n't look for the market to have much upside from current levels
your <unk> n page - one story on the renewed plight of <unk> <unk> says that <unk> <unk> had lost its chance to be in the telephone business by turning down <unk> <unk> <unk> offer to it of his invention because it supposedly felt that voice communication would never replace the telegraph
such is hardly the case
<unk> father - in-law <unk> <unk> <unk> wealthy and well - connected obtained financing n to start the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> which even had a subsidiary in <unk> <unk> called the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>

when <unk> established that the <unk> patent caveat was registered <unk> days before <unk> application <unk> <unk> dropped the lawsuit and agreed never to enter the telephone business the basis for the company current plight

troubled <unk> <unk> said n it fired more than half its work force and is discontinuing its hardware business to focus on its software and service operations
the ailing company which has reported net losses for n consecutive quarters said <unk> it wo n't manufacture network computer systems any more and will greatly reduce its costly direct sales force

further he said n the company does n't have the capital needed to build the business over the next year or two
we flat ran out of financing resources <unk> <unk> said
we had to do something structurally and radically different
as a result he said <unk> <unk> will focus on servicing its installed base of systems trying to provide maintenance for other manufacturers and expanding its software business using some of the applications n it developed for its hardware
the company currently offers a word - processing package for personal computers called <unk>

it was <unk> <unk> first visit to <unk> in <unk> that set in motion the historic rapprochement between <unk> and <unk>
but the former <unk> president sixth visit to <unk> during which he spoke at length with chinese leaders was nowhere near as successful at easing strains that have recently afflicted the sino - <unk> relationship
<unk> <unk> the most prominent <unk> <unk> to come to <unk> since <unk> bloody suppression of pro - democracy demonstrators in <unk> harped on international outrage over the massacre
the chinese in turn took aim at american interference in <unk> domestic affairs
one official newspaper <unk> <unk> even directly criticized <unk> <unk> who is normally referred to here as an old friend
the paper accused him of being a leading proponent of peaceful evolution a catch phrase n to describe what <unk> believes <unk> is the policy of western countries to seduce socialist nations into the capitalist sphere
the tension was evident on <unk> evening during <unk> <unk> final banquet toast normally an opportunity for reciting platitudes about eternal friendship
instead <unk> <unk> reminded his host chinese <unk> <unk> <unk> that americans have n't forgiven <unk> leaders for the military assault of <unk> <unk> that killed hundreds and perhaps thousands of demonstrators
many in the <unk> <unk> including many friends of <unk> believe n the crackdown was excessive and unjustified <unk> <unk> told <unk> <unk> who was directly involved in ordering the attack
the events of <unk> through <unk> damaged the respect and confidence which most americans previously had for the leaders of <unk>
the chinese responded in an equally undiplomatic fashion
in talks with <unk> <unk> chinese leaders expressed no regret for the killings and even suggested that the <unk> was prominently involved in the demonstrations this spring
in a meeting <unk> <unk> leader <unk> <unk> told <unk> <unk> frankly speaking the <unk> was involved too deeply in the turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion which occurred in <unk> not long ago
<unk> was the real victim and it is unjust to reprove <unk> for it
despite the harsh exchanges the <unk> and <unk> still seem to be looking for a way n to mend relations which have deteriorated into what <unk> <unk> referred to as the greatest crisis in chinese - american relations since his initial visit to <unk> n years ago
in his return toast to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> the relationship had reached a stalemate
relations between <unk> and the <unk> have been tense since <unk> <unk> when chinese dissident <unk> <unk> and his wife <unk> <unk> took refuge in the <unk> <unk> in <unk>
shortly afterwards <unk> <unk> imposed a series of anti - <unk> sanctions including suspension of most high - level talks which could be codified in <unk> congressional legislation in the coming weeks
<unk> <unk> is traveling in <unk> as a private citizen but he has made clear that he is an unofficial envoy for the <unk> administration
<unk> <unk> met <unk> <unk> and his national security adviser <unk> <unk> before coming to <unk> on <unk>
and he plans to brief the president at the end of the week <unk> sources said n
<unk> <unk> was to leave <unk> today
according to an american member of the <unk> party the former president raised a number of controversial issues in his n hours of talks with top - level chinese officials
these included <unk> economic policies human rights and the question of <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> also proposed that <unk> restore its participation in the <unk> <unk> a <unk> government - funded academic exchange
<unk> pulled out of the program in <unk>
in his talks the former president urged <unk> leaders to acknowledge that their nation is part of the world community and welcome the infusion of outside contacts and ideas
ideas are going over borders and there no <unk> ideological weapon that can shoot them down he told a group of americans at the <unk> <unk> on <unk>
there are no signs however of <unk> yielding on key issues
but in one minor matter <unk> <unk> appears to have gained a concession
in a meeting with <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> said that he hoped n he would n't encounter guards with machine guns during his visit to the <unk> <unk>
sure enough when he arrived at the embassy two days later the machine - gun-toting guards were gone for the first time in five months
a few blocks away at the <unk> ambassador residence the guards encircling the compound also had discarded their <unk> - model arms for the first time since early <unk>
but the guards there retained their pistols and a large contingent of plainclothes police remained nearby in unmarked cars
moreover police and soldiers continue to harass americans who have filed several protests with the <unk> <unk> in the past week
several times chinese guards have pointed their automatic rifles at young children of <unk> diplomats and clicked the trigger
the rifles were n't loaded
your <unk> n article <unk> <unk> firms <unk> <unk> graduates states industrial companies are accusing financial institutions of jeopardizing <unk> economy by raising the salary stakes for new employees
the japanese industrial companies should know better
they are barking up the wrong tree because it is basically their fault n they ca n't attract new employees
<unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> believes <unk> the money worship among young people caused the problem
he is just passing the buck to young people
what wrong with asking for more money
money is not everything but it is necessary and business is not volunteer work
it is not unethical to choose a higher - salaried job
unfortunately japanese manufacturers have neither good working conditions nor good compensation packages
i get the impression that some japanese managers believe n working harder for less money is beautiful
i visited a lot of major japanese manufacturers but i never felt <unk> i would want to be employed by any of them
many of them recently have been spending a lot of money on public relations and advertising to improve their images but they should realize that the most important thing is real change not changing people perceptions
if the japanese companies are seriously considering their survival they could do at least three things to improve the situation raise salaries higher than those of financial institutions improve working conditions better offices and more vacations for example accept and hire more labor from outside <unk>
<unk>
in reference to your <unk> n page - one article <unk> <unk> <unk> even higher ratings than the <unk> it is regrettable that you must continually define blacks by our negatives among liberals n have positive views of her while n approve of the president job performance
in part this may reflect the fact that she speaks a more progressive language than her husband as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> puts it
among professionals n have a favorable opinion of her compared to n who approve of her husband performance
while a quarter of black voters disapprove of <unk> <unk> handling of his job only n have a negative view of his spouse
the statistics imply that three - quarters of blacks approve of <unk> <unk> job performance and n of blacks approve of <unk> <unk>
if the assumption is that it is surprising that so few blacks find <unk> and <unk> <unk> distasteful the positive view is even more newsworthy
such an editorial point of view perpetuates an insidious stereotyped perspective
why are we blacks continually defined by our minority and the lowest common denominator

program traders are fond of predicting that if they are blocked in the <unk> they will simply emigrate to foreign stock markets
but in <unk> and <unk> where computer - driven trading now plays a small but growing role traders say n a number of hurdles loom
government officials especially in <unk> probably would resist any onslaught of program trading by players trying to shrug off the <unk> furor over their activities and marching abroad with their business
<unk> is very concerned about the possible effects of program trading a senior japanese official said n after the <unk> n stock plunge in <unk> <unk>
<unk> stock - index futures are n't even traded in <unk> now
and because of the time difference the japanese and the <unk> markets trading hours do n't overlap
it all adds up to a barrier to american - style index arbitrage the most popular form of <unk> program trading that seeks to exploit brief differences between prices of stocks in <unk> <unk> and the price of a futures contract in <unk> based on those stocks
about <unk> of all program trading by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> firms in <unk> took place in foreign markets according to <unk> <unk> data
yet it is difficult to imagine <unk> racing to introduce <unk> - style stock - index futures
<unk> <unk> <unk> already is scrutinizing institutional investors activity to see whether policy changes are needed to cope with the current level of program trading said <unk> <unk> <unk> vice minister for international finance
program trading has taken off in <unk> since last year introduction of home - market stock - index futures trading on the <unk> and <unk> stock exchanges
but regulators are wary
they have n't forgotten the leap in share prices last <unk> n when the first bout of foreign - led index arbitrage drove stocks skyward in the last half - hour of trading startling regulators who thought n they had written enough rules n to prevent such a swing
<unk> <unk> <unk> had set up mechanisms n to limit how far futures prices could fall in a single session and to give market operators the authority to suspend trading in futures at any time
maybe it was n't enough a <unk> <unk> official noted after the <unk> n surge
<unk> regulators have since tightened controls on index - related stock purchases
<unk> leading program traders are the big <unk> securities houses though the japanese are playing catch - up
some <unk> firms notably <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> have reaped a hefty chunk of their japanese earnings from index arbitrage both for customers and for their own accounts
<unk> <unk> last week joined a growing list of <unk> securities firms that have stopped doing index arbitrage for their own accounts
both <unk> <unk> <unk> who heads <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> who heads <unk> <unk> there ascribe a good part of their firms success in <unk> to their ability to offer sophisticated futures - related investment strategies to big institutional clients
they do n't have plans to cut back
it has not been disruptive in the markets here <unk> <unk> said
the real difference seems to be that the cash market here is big enough and liquid enough that the futures market is n't having the same impact <unk> it does in <unk>
the british also are scrutinizing program trades
index - arbitrage trading is something n we want to watch closely an official at <unk> <unk> <unk> said n
we do n't think n there is cause for concern at the moment
<unk> serves increasingly as a conduit for program trading of <unk> stocks
market professionals said <unk> <unk> has several attractions
first the trading is done over the counter and is n't reported on either the <unk> or <unk> stock trading tapes
second it can be used to unwind positions before <unk> trading begins but at prices pegged to the previous session <unk> <unk> close
in addition to the extra privacy of these trades the transactions can often be less expensive to execute because the parties do n't have to pay a floor brokerage fee or a specialist fee
still much less index - arbitrage activity is done over here than in the <unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> chief investment manager at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which manages about <unk> billion n billion in <unk> <unk> institutional funds
<unk> has two main index - arbitrage instruments
a <unk> <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> index option contract is traded on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> options <unk>
and an <unk> - <unk> futures contract is traded on the <unk> <unk> <unk> futures <unk>
both contracts have gained a following since the <unk> global market crash
the average number of <unk> - <unk> option contracts traded on the <unk> exchange has surged nearly tenfold since the contract launch in <unk>
this year the average of daily contracts traded totaled n up from <unk> a year earlier and from <unk> in <unk>
but a survey early this summer indicated that the volume of index - options trading was only n of the size of the underlying equity market exchange officials said n
this compares with estimates that the <unk> derivatives market is perhaps four times as large as the underlying domestic market
the <unk> voted to boost the federal minimum wage for the first time since early n casting a solid n vote for a compromise measure backed by <unk> <unk>
the vote came after a debate replete with complaints from both proponents and critics of a substantial increase in the wage floor
advocates said <unk> the <unk> rise to n an hour by <unk> n is too small for the working poor while opponents argued that the increase will still hurt small business and cost many thousands of jobs
but the legislation reflected a compromise agreed to on <unk> by <unk> <unk> and democratic leaders in <unk> after congressional republicans urged the <unk> <unk> to bend a bit from its previous resistance to compromise
so both sides accepted the compromise which would lead to the first lifting of the minimum wage since a four - year law was enacted in <unk> raising the wage to n an hour from <unk>
under the measure passed yesterday the minimum wage would rise to <unk> next <unk>
the <unk> plans to take up the measure quickly and is expected to pass it
there are no smiles about this bill <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said during <unk> floor debate yesterday
but because it all n we got i going to vote for it
while the minimum wage had traditionally been pegged at half the average <unk> manufacturing wage the level of n an hour in <unk> will still be less than n of average factory pay <unk> <unk> said <unk>
but <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> instead praised the <unk> acceptance of a new youth training wage a subminimum that <unk> administrations have sought for many years
adopting a training - wage policy means getting beyond the nickel and diming of the minimum wage <unk> <unk> said <unk>
policy makers regard the youth wage as helping to limit the loss of jobs from an increase in the minimum wage but they have lately touted it as necessary to help impart job skills to entrants into the work force
labor unions and democrats long fought the idea but recently acceded to it in the face of <unk> administration insistence
the compromise sets the training wage at n an hour next <unk> and at n an hour or <unk> of the minimum wage in <unk> n
employers can pay the subminimum for <unk> days without restriction to workers with less than six months of job experience and for another <unk> days if the company uses a government - certified training program for the young workers
the training wage covers only workers who are <unk> to n years old
the <unk> <unk> previously insisted on an unrestricted six - month training wage that could be paid any time n a worker of any age took a new job
the <unk> <unk> of <unk> still opposed to any mininum - wage increase said <unk> the compromise plan to lift the wage floor n in two stages between <unk> n and <unk> n will be impossible for many employers to accommodate and will result in the elimination of jobs for american workers and higher prices for american consumers

the question now can he act more like hard - charging <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> the n chairman and chief executive officer of <unk> - <unk> <unk> is leading the forest - product concern unsolicited <unk> billion bid for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> has given the offer a public cold shoulder a reaction <unk> <unk> <unk> has n't faced in his n earlier acquisitions all of which were negotiated behind the scenes
so far <unk> <unk> is trying to entice <unk> into negotiating a friendly surrender while talking tough
we are prepared to pursue aggressively completion of this transaction he says
but a takeover battle opens up the possibility of a bidding war with all n that implies
if a competitor enters the game for example <unk> <unk> could face the dilemma of paying a premium for <unk> or seeing the company fall into the arms of a rival
given that choice associates of <unk> <unk> and industry observers say n the former university president who has developed a reputation for not overpaying for anything would fold
there a price above which i positive <unk> <unk> has the courage <unk> not to pay says <unk> <unk> <unk> - <unk> executive vice president for pulp and paper
says long - time associate <unk> <unk> vice president corporate development at <unk> industries <unk> he is n't of the old school of winning at any cost
he also is a consensus manager insiders say n
the decision to make the bid for <unk> for example was made only after all six members of <unk> - <unk> management committee signed onto the deal even though <unk> <unk> knew <unk> he wanted to go after the company early on says <unk> <unk> <unk>
associates say <unk> <unk> <unk> picked up that careful approach to management as president of <unk> <unk> <unk>
assuming that post at the age of <unk> he managed by consensus as is the rule in universities says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a university official who is researching a book on <unk> <unk>
but he also showed a willingness to take a strong stand
in <unk> <unk> <unk> called in state police to arrest student protesters who were occupying a university building
that impressed <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> - <unk> chief executive at the time whom <unk> <unk> had met while fundraising for the institute
in <unk> <unk> <unk> enticed <unk> <unk> into joining the company as executive vice president in charge of chemicals the move befuddled many in <unk> - <unk> who did n't believe <unk> a university administrator could make the transition to the corporate world
but <unk> <unk> rose swiftly through the ranks demonstrating a raw intelligence that he says <unk> he knew <unk> he possessed early on
the son of a physicist <unk> <unk> skipped first grade because his reading ability was so far above his classmates
moving rapidly through school he graduated <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> at age n after spending only <unk> n years in college
he earned his doctorate in nuclear physics from the <unk> <unk> of <unk>
<unk> <unk> agrees that he has a retentive memory but friends say <unk> that an understatement
they call it photographic
<unk> <unk> also has engineered a surprising turnaround of <unk> - <unk>
taking over as chief executive officer in <unk> he inherited a company that was mired in debt and hurt by a recession - inspired slide in its building - products business
<unk> <unk> began selling non - core businesses such as oil and gas and chemicals
he even sold one unit that made vinyl checkbook covers
at the same time he began building up the pulp and paper segment of the company while refocusing building products on home repair and remodeling rather than materials for new - home construction
the idea was to buffet building products from cycles in new - home construction
the formula has paid off so far
<unk> - <unk> sales climbed to n billion last year compared with n billion in <unk> when <unk> <unk> took the reins
profit from continuing operations has soared to n million from n million
<unk> <unk> attributes the gains to the philosophy of concentrating on what a company knows best
the record of companies that have diversified is n't all that impressive he says
<unk> would n't be a diversification
it would be a good match <unk> <unk> and many analysts say n of two healthy companies with high - quality assets and strong cash flows
the resulting company would be the largest forest - products concern in the world with combined sales of more than n billion
but can <unk> <unk> carry it off
in this instance industry observers say n he is entering uncharted waters
says <unk> <unk> an analyst at <unk> <unk> <unk> this is the greatest acquisition challenge n he has faced
a <unk> - <unk> conference approved major portions of a package for more than n million in economic aid for <unk> that relies heavily on n million in credit and loan guarantees in fiscal <unk> in hopes of stimulating future trade and investment
for the <unk> for <unk> <unk> appropriators approved n million in secondary loan guarantees under an expanded trade credit insurance program and total loan guarantees for the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are increased by n million over fiscal <unk> as part of the same <unk> package
the conference approved at least n million in direct cash and development assistance as well and though no decision was made both sides are committed to adding more than n million in economic support funds and environmental initiatives sought by the <unk> administration
the agreement on <unk> contrasts with the major differences remaining over the underlying foreign aid bill which has already provoked veto threats by the <unk> <unk> and is sharply confined under this year budget
these fiscal pressures are also a factor in shaping the <unk> package and while more ambitious authorizing legislation is still pending the appropriations bill in conference will be more decisive on <unk> aid to <unk> <unk>
to accommodate the additional cash assistance the <unk> <unk> <unk> last week was required to reallocate an estimated n million from the <unk>
and though the size of the loan guarantees approved yesterday is significant recent experience with a similar program in <unk> <unk> indicates that it could take several years before the new polish government can fully use the aid effectively
the action on <unk> came as the conference separately approved n million for international population planning activities an <unk> increase over fiscal <unk>
the <unk> and <unk> are divided over whether the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> will receive any portion of these appropriations but the size of the increase is itself significant
in a second area of common concern the world environment an additional n million will be provided in development assistance <unk> to fund a series of initiatives related both to global warming and the plight of the african elephant
the sweeping nature of the bill draws a variety of special interest amendments running from an import exemption for a <unk> airplane museum to a small but intriguing struggle among sugar producing nations over the fate of <unk> quota of exports to the profitable <unk> market
<unk> was stripped of this right because of <unk> differences with the <unk> regime but the central american country would have received a quota of <unk> metric tons over a n period ending <unk> <unk> <unk>
about a quarter of this share has already been reallocated according to the industry but the remaining n tons are still a lucrative target for growers because the current <unk> price of <unk> cents a pound runs as much as a nickel a pound above the world rate
the potential sales are nearly n million and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> began the bidding this year by proposing language that the quota be allocated to <unk> - speaking countries of the <unk> such as <unk> and <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> a conservative californian added a provision of his own intended to assist <unk> and the <unk> then broadened the list further by including all countries in the <unk> <unk> <unk> initiate as well as the philippines backed by the powerful <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> wary of upsetting its <unk> <unk> allies has apparently instructed its lobbyist to abandon the provision initially drafted by <unk> <unk> but the greater question is whether <unk> <unk> who has strong ties to the sugar industry is able to insert a claim by the philippines
in separate floor action the <unk> waived budget restrictions and gave quick approval to n billion in supplemental appropriations for law enforcement and anti - drug programs in fiscal <unk>
the funding is attached to an estimated n billion transportation bill that goes next to the <unk> and carries with it a proposed permanent smoking ban on virtually all <unk> domestic airline flights
the leadership hopes to move the compromise measure promptly to the <unk> <unk> but in recent days the <unk> has been as likely to bounce bills back to the <unk>
the most recent example was a nearly n billion fiscal <unk> bill funding the <unk> <unk> and <unk> departments
and after losing a battle <unk> night with the <unk> <unk> relations <unk> appropriators from both houses are expected to be forced back to conference
beauty takes backseat to <unk> on
everyone agrees that most of the nation old bridges need to be repaired or replaced
but there disagreement over how to do it
highway officials insist n the ornamental railings on older bridges are n't strong enough to prevent vehicles from crashing through
but other people do n't want to lose the bridges beautiful sometimes historic features
the primary purpose of a railing is to contain a vehicle and not to provide a scenic view says <unk> <unk> a planner with the <unk> <unk> <unk>
he and others prefer to install railings such as the type <unk> safety shape a four - foot-high concrete slab with no openings
in <unk> <unk> the type <unk> railing is being used to replace arched openings on the <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> who teaches art at <unk> <unk> calls the new structure just an ugly bridge and one that blocks the view of a new park below
in <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> will soon be replaced the cast - iron medallions from its railings relegated to a park
compromises are possible
citizens in <unk> <unk> upset over changes to a bridge negotiated a deal the bottom half of the railing will be type <unk> while the top half will have the old bridge floral pattern
similarly highway engineers agreed to keep the old railings on the <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> as long as they could install a crash barrier between the sidewalk and the road

seed for <unk> <unk> fails to take
it a two birds with one stone deal <unk> <unk> architects propose using grain elevators to house prisoners

the <unk> <unk> cited <unk> <unk> for numerous health and safety violations at two <unk> plants and proposed n million in fines the largest penalty ever proposed for alleged workplace violations by an employer
the department <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> proposed fines of n million for alleged violations at the company <unk> <unk> <unk> steel mill that was a record for proposed penalties at any single facility
<unk> cited nearly n alleged violations of federal electrical crane - safety record - keeping and other requirements
a second citation covering the company <unk> <unk> coke works involved more than n alleged violations of electrical - safety and other requirements for which <unk> proposed n million in fines
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said the magnitude of these penalties and citations is matched only by the magnitude of the hazards to workers which resulted from corporate indifference to worker safety and health and severe cutbacks in the maintenance and repair programs needed to remove those hazards
<unk> said n there have been three worker fatalities at the two plants in the past two years and n deaths since n
<unk> <unk> the head of <unk> said <unk> <unk> managers have known about many of the safety and health deficiencies at the plants for years yet have failed to take necessary action to counteract the hazards
particularly flagrant <unk> <unk> said <unk> are the company numerous failures to properly record injuries at its <unk> works in spite of the firm promise n it had made in an earlier corporate - wide settlement agreement to correct such discrepancies
that settlement was in <unk> n
a <unk> spokesman said n the company had n't yet received any documents from <unk> regarding the penalty or fine
once we do they will receive very serious evaluation the spokesman said
no consideration is more important than the health and safety of our employees
<unk> said <unk> it has been cooperating with <unk> since the agency began investigating the <unk> and <unk> works
he said that if and when safety problems were identified they were corrected
the <unk> citations represented the first sizable enforcement action taken by <unk> under <unk> <unk>
he has promised stiffer fines though the size of penalties sought by <unk> have been rising in recent years even before he took office this year
the big problem is that <unk> management has proved unwilling to devote the necessary resources and manpower to removing hazards and to safeguarding safety and health in the plants said <unk> <unk> <unk> regional administrator in <unk>

due to an editing error a letter to the editor in yesterday edition from <unk> <unk> <unk> mistakenly identified the <unk>
it should be the <unk> resources <unk> <unk>
your <unk> n editorial the <unk> <unk> referred to research by us and six of our colleagues that was reported in the <unk> <unk> issue of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
your comments implied n we had discovered that the principal cause of homelessness is to be found in the large numbers of mentally ill and substance - abusing people in the homeless population
we have made no such statement
it is clear that most mentally ill people and most alcoholics do not become homeless
the causes of homelessness are poorly understood and complex in any individual case
in quoting from our research you emphasized the high prevalance of mental illness and alcoholism
you did not note that the homeless people n we examined had a multitude of physical disorders in addition to their psychiatric problems and substance abuse
they suffered from malnutrition chest diseases cardiovascular disorders skin problems infectious diseases and the aftereffects of assaults and rape
homeless people not only lack safety privacy and shelter they also lack the elementary necessities of nutrition cleanliness and basic health care
in a recent report the <unk> of <unk> pointed out that certain health problems may predispose a person to homelessness others may be a consequence of it and a third category is composed of disorders whose treatment is difficult or impossible if a person lacks adequate shelter
the interactions between health and homelessness are complex defying sweeping generalizations as to cause or effect
if we look to the future preventing homelessness is an important objective
this will require us to develop a much more sophisticated understanding of the dynamics of homelessness than we currently possess an understanding that can be developed only through careful study and research
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>
a study by <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> says <unk> homelessness is due to a complex array of problems with the common thread of poverty
the study shows that nearly n of the homeless population is made up of women and children and that only n of the homeless exhibits some combination of drug alcohol and mental problems
according to <unk> <unk> homelessness is simultaneously a housing problem an employment problem a demographic problem a problem of social disaffiliation a mental health problem a family violence problem a problem created by the cutbacks in social welfare spending a problem resulting from the decay of the traditional nuclear family and a problem intimately connected to the recent increase in the number of persons living below the poverty level
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
to quote the highly regarded director of a privately funded drop - in center for the homeless in <unk> <unk> if you homeless you do n't sleep for fear of being robbed or murdered
after your first three weeks of sleep deprivation you scarcely in touch with reality any more without psychiatric treatment you may well be unable to fend for yourself ever again
some of the homeless obviously had pre - existing mental illness or addiction
but many others have fallen through cracks in the economy into the grim brutal world of our city streets
once there what ways of escape are open to them other than drink drugs or insanity
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
you dismiss as sentimental the view that the reduction of federal housing - assistance programs by <unk> might have played a significant role in the increased number of men and women sleeping on our city streets during the <unk> - <unk> years
there is no sign that you bothered to consider the inverse of your logic namely that mental illness and substance abuse might be to some degree consequences rather than causes of homelessness
your research stopped when a convenient assertion could be made
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
of the approximately n sponsors of the recent march in <unk> for the homeless you chose to cite such groups as the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of bricklayers and <unk> <unk> insinuating that the march got its major support from self - serving groups that know a good thing when they see it and that the crusade was based on greed or the profit motive
but is n't the desire for profit the driving force behind those who subscribe to and advertise in your paper
why did n't you mention the <unk> or the <unk> or catholic charities <unk> or a hundred other nonprofit organizations that participated in the march
as for the findings on the <unk> <unk> homeless who underwent psychiatric examinations i suggest n you conduct your own survey
choose n business executives including perhaps someone from your own staff and put them out on the streets to be deprived for one month of their homes families and income
i would predict that within a short time most of them would find <unk> a satisfactory substitute for <unk> <unk> and that their normal phobias anxieties depressions and substance abuse would increase dramatically

<unk> <unk> <unk> said n it plans to raise n million to n million canadian dollars <unk> n million to n million through a private placement of perpetual preferred shares

a spokesman for the <unk> cable television and telecommunications concern said <unk> the coupon rate has n't yet been fixed but will probably be set at around <unk>
he declined to discuss other terms of the issue
the <unk> passed legislation designed to make it easier for the <unk> <unk> to block airline leveraged buy - outs
the final vote came after the <unk> rejected republican efforts to weaken the bill and approved two amendments sought by organized labor
the <unk> administration has threatened to veto such a bill because of what it views as an undesirable intrusion into the affairs of industry but the n vote suggests that supporters have the potential n to override a veto
the broader question is where the <unk> stands on the issue
while the <unk> <unk> <unk> has approved legislation similar to the <unk> bill on airline leveraged buy - outs the measure has n't yet come to the full floor
although the legislation would apply to acquisitions involving any major airline it is aimed at giving the <unk> <unk> the chance to review in advance transactions financed by large amounts of debt
the purpose of the bill is to put the brakes on airline acquisitions that would so load a carrier up with debt that it would impede safety or a carrier ability to compete <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said
the bill as it was approved by the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> would give the <unk> <unk> up to <unk> days <unk> to review any purchase of <unk> or more of the stock in an airline
the department would be required to block the buy - out if the acquisition is likely to financially weaken a carrier so that safety would be impaired its ability to compete would be sharply diminished it would be put into foreign control or if the transaction would result in the sale of airline - related assets unless selling such assets had an overriding public benefit
the <unk> approved an amendment offered by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that would in addition to the previous criteria also require the department to block the acquisition of an airline if the added debt incurred were likely to result in a reduction in the number of the carrier employees or their wages or benefits
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said n the amendment which passed n would let the american worker know that we consider them occasionally
but <unk> <unk> said that the provision which he dubbed a special interest amendment was likely to make the bill even more controversial
on <unk> the <unk> approved a labor - backed amendment that would require the <unk> <unk> to reject airline acquisitions if the person seeking to purchase a carrier had run two or more airlines previously that have filed for protection from creditors under chapter n of the federal <unk> <unk>
the provision called the two - time-losers amendment by its supporters apparently was aimed at preventing <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from attempting to take over another airline
follow - up report
you now may drop by the <unk> of <unk> offices in <unk> and read the text of what the <unk> is broadcasting to those n million people around the world who tune in to it each week
you can even take notes extensive notes for the <unk> folks wo n't look over your shoulder about what you read
you can do all this even if you not a reporter or a researcher or a scholar or a member of <unk>
and my newspaper can print the text of those broadcasts
until the other day you as an ordinary citizen of this democracy had no right to see what your government was telling your cousins around the world
that was the law
and i apparently had no right to print hither what the <unk> was booming to yon
it was censorship
it was outrageous
and it was stupid
the theory was that the <unk> is a propaganda agency and this government should n't propagandize its own people
that sounds neat but this government any government propagandizes its own people every day
<unk> press releases speeches briefings tours of military facilities publications are all propaganda of sorts
propaganda is just information n to support a viewpoint and the beauty of a democracy is that it enables you to hear or read every viewpoint and then make up your own mind on an issue
the restrictions on viewing and dissemination of <unk> material were especially absurd an agency in the information business was not being allowed to inform
in <unk> <unk> i wrote in this space about this issue
assuming n it was n't one of those columns that you clipped and put on the refrigerator door i review the facts
the <unk> of <unk> is a government agency that broadcasts news and views some might say propaganda in <unk> languages to n million listeners around the world
it does a first - rate job
its budget n million is paid for by you
but a n law barred the dissemination of that material in the <unk>
the law let scholars reporters and researchers read texts of <unk> material only at <unk> headquarters in <unk> but it barred them from copying texts
and of course there that word dissemination
how that again
you may come by the agency to read but not copy either manually or by photocopying a <unk> official explained when i asked
what if i tune in my short - wave radio transcribe an editorial or program and print it in my newspaper
nor are you free to reprint such material i was advised
that sounded a lot like censorship so after years of letters and conversations that went nowhere i sued
a couple of weeks ago i lost the case in federal district court in <unk> <unk>
at least that the way n it was reported
and indeed the lawsuit was dismissed
but i i like to think of it in terms of we all of us won the point
for a funny thing happened on the way to the ruling the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which runs the <unk> changed its position on three key points
the <unk> said that on reflection of course i could print anything n i could get my hands on
the word dissemination it decided n referred only to itself
the <unk> officially and publicly declared the absolute right of everyone except the <unk> to disseminate agency program materials in the <unk> <unk> my lawyer the scholarly <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> said in a memo pointing out the facts and trying to make me feel good after the press reported that i had lost
the court noted the new <unk> position but just in case officially found that <unk> did not intend to preclude plaintiffs from disseminating <unk> information domestically
the <unk> said that on reflection anyone could view the <unk> materials not just the reporters scholars researchers and congressmen who are mentioned in the statute
the <unk> publicly and officially stated in the litigation that all persons are allowed access to the materials notwithstanding the statutory designations because the <unk> has determined that it will not check the credentials of any person appearing and requesting to see the materials <unk> <unk> noted
and the <unk> said that all of us could take extensive notes
the agency publicly and officially declared in the lawsuit that persons who examine the materials may make notes and while the agency position is that persons may not take verbatim notes no one will check to determine what notes a person has taken <unk> <unk> reported
i had sought in my suit the right to print <unk> material which had been denied me and i had sought a right to receive the information arguing in effect that a right to print government information is n't very helpful if i have no right to get the information
but the court disagreed
the <unk> <unk> proscribes the government from passing laws abridging the right to free speech <unk> <unk> <unk> ruled
the <unk> <unk> does not prescribe a duty upon the government to assure easy access to information for members of the press
so now the situation is this
you have a right to read <unk> of <unk> scripts if you do n't mind traveling to <unk> every week or so and visiting the <unk> office during business hours
i have a right to print those scripts if i go there and laboriously but no longer surreptitiously copy them out in long hand
but neither of us can copy the material on a <unk> machine or have it sent to us
in an era when every government agency has a public - relations machine that sends you stuff whether you want it or not this does seem odd
indeed <unk> <unk> ruled that it would be easy to conclude that the <unk> position is inappropriate or even stupid but it the law
so the next step i suspect <unk> is to try to get the law changed
we i assume <unk> you in this with me at this point need to get three words for examination only eliminated from the law
section n of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> says <unk> <unk> material shall be available to certain of us but now thanks to the <unk> new position all of us for examination only
if those words were n't there the nice people at the <unk> would be able to send you the information or at the very least let you photocopy it
this is not a trivial issue
you have raised important questions which ought to be answered what does <unk> say about <unk> abroad how do we say it and how can american taxpayers get the answers to these questions a man wrote me a couple of years ago
the man was <unk> <unk> <unk>
at the time he was director of
he had no answers then
now there are some
this democracy is suddenly a little more democratic
i feel pretty good about it
<unk> <unk> is editor and co - owner of the <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> and president of <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> was forced out as <unk> <unk> <unk> president and chief executive officer the strongest evidence yet of the power that <unk> family members intend to wield in reshaping the troubled food company
<unk> <unk> <unk> the n president of the company <unk> <unk> unit and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the chief financial officer will run <unk> as a team dividing responsibilities rather evenly until a successor is named
the board already has been searching for strong outside candidates including food - industry executives with considerable international experience
<unk> <unk> reacted favorably to <unk> <unk> departure and its implications
in heavy trading on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> shares rose n to close at <unk>
the profit motive of the major shareholders has clearly changed for the better said <unk> <unk> a food industry analyst for <unk> - <unk> in <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> was widely seen as sales and not profit oriented
new managers would think a little more like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> added
some of the surge in the stock price appeared to be linked to revived takeover speculation which has contributed to volatility of <unk> shares in recent months
campbell international businesses particularly in the <unk> and <unk> appear to be at the heart of its problems
<unk> has fallen short of targets and operating earnings are far below results in <unk> units
for example <unk> is a distant third in the <unk> frozen foods market where it recently paid <unk> times earnings for <unk> <unk> <unk> and wound up with far more capacity than it could use
similarly <unk> italian biscuit operation <unk> <unk> <unk> has been hurt by overproduction and distribution problems
such problems will require considerable skill to resolve
however neither <unk> <unk> nor <unk> <unk> has much international experience
<unk> <unk> a seasoned marketer who is said to have a good rapport with <unk> employees will have responsibility for all domestic operations except the <unk> <unk> unit
<unk> <unk> a veteran of several manufacturing companies who joined <unk> in <unk> will take charge of all overseas operations as well as <unk>
in an joint interview yesterday both men said n they would like to be the company next chief executive
<unk> <unk> <unk> had been under intense pressure from the board to boost <unk> mediocre performance to the level of other food companies
the board is dominated by the heirs of the late <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who controlled about n of <unk> stock when he died in <unk>
in recent months <unk> <unk> children and other family members have pushed for improved profitability and higher returns on their equity
in <unk> the company took a n million pretax charge against fiscal <unk> earnings when it announced a world - wide restructuring plan
the plan calls for closing at least nine plants and eliminating about <unk> jobs
but analysts said n early results from the reorganization have been disappointing especially in <unk> and there were signs that the board became impatient
<unk> officials said <unk> <unk> <unk> was n't available yesterday to discuss the circumstances of his departure
the company prepared statement quoted him as saying the ceo succession is well along and i decided for personal reasons to take early retirement
but people familiar with the agenda of the board meeting last week in <unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> was fired
<unk> <unk> himself had said repeatedly that he intended to stay on until he reached the conventional retirement age of <unk> in <unk> n unless i get fired
<unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> had withdrawn his name as a candidate for re - election as a director at the annual shareholder meeting scheduled for <unk> n
for fiscal <unk> <unk> <unk> received a salary of <unk>
he owns about n shares of <unk> stock and has options to buy more than <unk> additional shares
he will be eligible for an annual pension of more than <unk> with certain other fringe benefits
during <unk> <unk> nine - year term as president the company sales rose to n billion from n billion and net income increased to n million from n million the statement said <unk>
<unk> <unk> said n he and <unk> <unk> both advocated closing some plants as long ago as early n
you got to make the restructuring work said <unk> <unk>
you got to make those savings now
<unk> <unk> expressed confidence that he and <unk> <unk> can convince the board of their worthiness to run the company
we look upon this as a great opportunity to prove the fact that we have a tremendous management team he said
he predicted that the board would give the current duo until early next year before naming a new chief executive
<unk> <unk> said <unk> the two have orders to focus on bottom - line profits and to take a hard look at our businesses what is good what is not so good
analysts generally applaud the performance of <unk> <unk> the company largest division which posted n unit sales growth and a n improvement in operating profit for fiscal <unk>
the way that we been managing <unk> <unk> can hopefully spread to other areas of the company <unk> <unk> said
in the interview at headquarters yesterday afternoon both men exuded confidence and seemed to work well together
you got two champions sitting right before you said <unk> <unk>

a successor was n't named which fueled speculation that <unk> <unk> may have clashed with <unk> <unk> <unk> whose family company <unk> publications <unk> owns <unk> <unk>
abrupt departures are n't unheard of within the <unk> empire
in an interview <unk> <unk> said <unk> his departure evolved out of discussions with <unk> <unk> and that the decision n i reached
he declined to elaborate other than to say it just seemed the right thing <unk> to do at this minute
sometimes you just go with your gut
<unk> <unk> said <unk> he will stay until <unk> n and work with his successor who is to be named soon
<unk> <unk> meanwhile insisted that he is n't unhappy with <unk> <unk> or the performance of <unk> <unk> the largest trade publishing house in the <unk>
the company said <unk> the publisher annual sales volume increased to n million from n million during <unk> <unk> tenure
<unk> has handled the extraordinary growth of the company quite brilliantly said <unk> <unk>
the company is doing well it stable it got good people
<unk> has an agenda and this seemed like the natural time
<unk> officials believe that while <unk> <unk> has enjoyed spectacular growth and has smoothly integrated many acquisitions in recent years some of the bigger ones have n't been absorbed so easily
<unk> <unk> <unk> acquired last year is said to be turning in disappointing results
as a private company <unk> <unk> does n't report its earnings
<unk> <unk> who succeeded <unk> <unk> has been only the second president of <unk> <unk> since it was founded in <unk>
speculation on his successor centers on a number of division heads at the house
possible candidates include <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> huge and successful paperback division
some say <unk> <unk> <unk> head of a recently acquired british company <unk> <unk> could be chosen
there is also speculation that <unk> <unk> could bring in a powerhouse businessman or another <unk> family member n to run the business side in combination with a publishing executive like <unk> <unk> who left <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to run the <unk> <unk> also owned by the <unk> family
not included on the most - likely-successor list are <unk> <unk> recruited two years ago to be publisher of adult trade books for <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> president of the prestigious <unk> <unk> <unk> unit
when <unk> <unk> took her job several important divisions that had reported to her predecessor were n't included partly because she did n't wish to be a full - time administrator
<unk> <unk> is widely viewed as a brilliant editor but a less - than-brilliant administrator and his own departure was rumored recently
<unk> <unk> a tall energetic man who is widely respected as a publishing executive has spent much of his time in recent years on human rights issues
<unk> learned during the <unk> administration that it could intimidate the executive branch by uttering again and again the same seven words provided that no funds shall be spent
this phrase once again is found throughout the many appropriations bills now moving through <unk>
it signals <unk> attempt under the pretext of guarding the public purse to deny the president the funding necessary to execute certain of his duties and prerogatives specified in <unk> <unk> of the <unk>
this species of congressional action is predicated on an interpretation of the appropriations clause that is erroneous and unconstitutional
the appropriations clause states that no money shall be drawn from the <unk> but in <unk> of appropriations made by <unk>
the prevailing interpretation of the clause on <unk> <unk> is that it gives <unk> an omnipresent veto over every conceivable action of the president through the ability to withhold funding
this interpretation was officially endorsed by <unk> in <unk> in the <unk> - <unk> <unk>
as partisans of congressional power understand a power of the purse so broadly construed would emasculate the presidency and swallow the principle of separation of powers
it is not supported by the text or history of the <unk>
the framers hardly discussed the appropriations clause at the <unk> <unk> of <unk> according to <unk> notes
to the extent n they did their concern was to ensure fiscal accountability
moreover the framers believed that the nation needed a unitary executive with the independence and resources n to perform the executive functions that the <unk> <unk> had performed poorly under the <unk> of <unk>
it would contradict that objective if the appropriations clause technically a limitation on legislative power could be read as placing the president on <unk> short leash making the executive consist of the president and every member of <unk>
as it went to the conference panel now deliberating the appropriations bill for the executive office of the president for fiscal <unk> contained some breathtaking attempts by <unk> to rewrite the <unk> under the pretext of protecting the public money
during the coming weeks <unk> <unk> must decide whether to veto the bills containing them or alternatively to sign these bills into law with a statement declaring their intrusions on executive power to be in violation of article ii and thus void and severable
the n appropriations legislation attempts to strip the president of his powers to make certain appointments as provided by <unk> <unk>
article ii places on the president the duty to nominate and by and with the advice and <unk> of the <unk> appoint ambassadors judges and other officers of the <unk>
it also empowers the president to make recess appointments without <unk> approval the <unk> shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the <unk> by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session
yet <unk> <unk> of the appropriations bill for the executive office provides no part of any appropriation for the current fiscal year contained in this or any other <unk> shall be paid to any person for the filling of any position for which he or she has been nominated after the <unk> has voted not to approve the nomination of said person
thus with one brief passage in an appropriations bill <unk> repeals the president power to make recess appointments under article <unk>
section n also imposes unconstitutional conditions on the president ability to nominate candidates of his choosing
the language of the appropriations rider implies that any nomination to any position of a rejected nominee will result in the president being denied funding n to pay that person salary
the president could probably not avoid this restriction by choosing people willing to serve without pay because the <unk> - <unk> <unk> prohibits voluntary service to the government
the n appropriations bills also contain a number of muzzling provisions that violate the recommendation clause in <unk> <unk> of the <unk>
<unk> provisions which might be called blindfold laws as well prevent the executive branch from even looking at certain policy options let alone from recommending them to <unk>
such laws violate the provision in <unk> <unk> that requires the president to make recommendations to <unk> but which gives the president the discretion n to select the subject matter of those recommendations
typically these laws seek to prevent executive branch officials from inquiring into whether certain federal programs make any economic sense or proposing more market - oriented alternatives to regulations
probably the most egregious example is a proviso in the appropriations bill for the executive office that prevents the president <unk> of <unk> and <unk> from subjecting agricultural marketing orders to any cost - benefit scrutiny
there is something inherently suspect about <unk> prohibiting the executive from even studying whether public funds are being wasted in some favored program or other
perhaps none of the unconstitutional conditions contained in the appropriations bills for fiscal n better illustrates <unk> attempt to usurp executive power than <unk> <unk> of the executive - office bill none of the funds made available pursuant to the provisions of this <unk> shall be used to implement administer or enforce any regulation which has been disapproved pursuant to a resolution of disapproval duly adopted in accordance with the applicable law of the <unk> <unk>
this provision amounts to a legislative veto over the president execution of the law since a one - house resolution could be said to be duly adopted even though it would require neither bicameral action in <unk> nor presentation to the president for his signature or veto
the <unk> <unk> decision in <unk> v. <unk> held that legislative vetoes are unconstitutional
<unk> <unk> should veto appropriations acts that contain these kinds of unconstitutional conditions on the president ability to discharge his duties and exercise his prerogatives
if <unk> <unk> fails to do so in his first year he will invite <unk> for the remainder of his presidency to rewrite article ii of the <unk> to suit its purposes
what becomes custom in the <unk> administration will only become more difficult n for future presidents including democrats to undo
<unk> <unk> learned that lesson
by <unk> then - <unk> <unk> <unk> was discussing arms control in <unk> with <unk> <unk> and then attempting to direct the president through an appropriations rider to treat the soviets as though the <unk> had ratified salt <unk>
if a veto is unworkable because it would leave part of the executive branch unfunded the president could sign the appropriations bills into law and assert a power of excision declaring the rider restricting his article ii powers to be unconstitutional and severable
the <unk> does not expressly give the president such power
however the president does have a duty not to violate the <unk>
the question is whether his only means of defense is the veto
excision of appropriations riders that trespass on the president duties and prerogative under article <unk> would be different from the line - item veto
as discussed in the context of controlling federal spending the line - item veto is characterized as a way n for the president to excise perfectly constitutional provisions in a spending bill that are objectionable merely because they conflict with his policy objectives
the excision of unconstitutional conditions in an appropriations bill would be a power of far more limited applicability
one could argue that it is not an assertion of a item veto at all for the president by exerting a power of excision to resist unconstitutional conditions in legislation that violate the separation of powers
there is no downside if the president asserts a right of excision over unconstitutional conditions in the fiscal <unk> appropriations bills
if <unk> does nothing <unk> <unk> will have won
if <unk> takes the dispute to the <unk> <unk> assuming n it can establish standing <unk> to sue <unk> <unk> might win
in that case he might receive an opinion from the court that is a vindication of the president right to perform the duties and exercise the prerogatives n the framers thought n should be entrusted to the executive
if <unk> <unk> loses at the court it might be disappointing as <unk> v. <unk> was for the <unk> administration
but the presidency would be no worse off than it is now
moreover the electorate would have received a valuable civics lesson in how the separation of powers works in practice
as it stands now <unk> presumes after the <unk> administration that the <unk> <unk> will take unconstitutional provisions in appropriations bills lying down
<unk> <unk> should set things straight
if he does not he will help realize <unk> fear in the <unk> <unk> . n of a legislature everywhere extending the sphere of its activity and drawing all powers into its impetuous vortex
<unk> <unk> served as an attorney in the <unk> administration
his longer analysis of executive power and the appropriations clause is to appear in the <unk> <unk> <unk> later this year
despite one of the most devastating droughts on record net cash income in the <unk> <unk> rose to a new high of n billion last year
the previous record was n billion in <unk> according to the <unk> <unk>
net cash income the amount left in farmers pockets after deducting expenses from gross cash income increased in n states in <unk> as the drought cut into crop yields and drove up commodity prices the department <unk> <unk> <unk> reported n yesterday
most of those states set farm income records
the worst crop damage occurred in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the northern <unk> plains
what saved many farmers from a bad year was the opportunity to reclaim large quantities of grain and other crops that they had mortgaged to the government under price - support loan programs
with prices soaring they were able to sell the reclaimed commodities at considerable profit the agency <unk> report said <unk>
in less parched areas meanwhile farmers who had little or no loss of production profited greatly from the higher prices
to the surprise of some analysts net cash income rose in some of the hardest - hit states including <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk>
analysts attributed the increases partly to the <unk> billion disaster - assistance package enacted by <unk>
last year record net cash income confirms the farm sector rebound from the agricultural depression of the early n
it also helps explain the reluctance of the major farm lobbies and many lawmakers to make any significant changes in the <unk> farm program next year
commodity prices have been rising in recent years with the farm price index hitting record peaks earlier this year as the government curtailed production with land - idling programs to reduce price - depressing surpluses
at the same time export demand for <unk> wheat corn and other commodities strengthened said <unk> <unk> a department analyst
farmers also benefited from strong livestock prices as the nation cattle inventory dropped close to a n low
all of these forces came together in <unk> to benefit agriculture <unk> <unk> said
<unk> led the nation with <unk> billion in net cash income last year followed by <unk> <unk> billion <unk> <unk> billion <unk> <unk> billion and <unk> <unk> billion
<unk> and <unk> were among the few major farm states n to log a decline in net cash income
despite federal disaster relief the drought of <unk> was a severe financial setback for an estimated n to n farmers according to the department
many lost their farms
<unk> economists do n't expect <unk> to be as good a year as <unk> was
indeed net cash income is likely to fall this year as farm expenses rise and government payments to farmers decline
at the same time an increase of land under cultivation after the drought has boosted production of corn soybeans and other commodities causing a fall in prices that has been only partly cushioned by heavy grain buying by the soviets
last year government payments to farmers slipped to less than n billion from a record n billion in <unk>
payments are expected to range between <unk> billion and n billion this year
after years of struggling the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> will publish its last edition today shut down by its parent <unk> <unk> following unsuccessful efforts to sell the venerable newspaper
the demise of the <unk> <unk> once the nation largest afternoon newspaper with circulation exceeding n turns the country second - largest city into a one - newspaper town at least in some senses
the <unk> <unk> <unk> with a circulation of more than n million dominates the region
but it faces stiff competition in <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> which sells more than <unk> copies a day and in the <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which sells more than <unk>
nearby cities such as <unk> and <unk> <unk> also have large dailies
in <unk> closely held <unk> based in <unk> <unk> put the paper on the block
speculation had it that the company was asking n million for an operation said to be losing about n million a year but others said <unk> <unk> might have virtually given the paper away
an attempted buy - out led by <unk> <unk> <unk> chief operating officer never materialized and a stream of what one staff member dismissed as tire - kickers and lookee - loos had filed through since
the prospective buyers included investor <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk>
the death of the <unk> a newsstand paper in a freeway town was perhaps inevitable
<unk> <unk> is a sprawling balkanized newspaper market and advertisers seemed to feel n they could buy space in the mammoth <unk> then target a particular area with one of the regional dailies
the <unk> was left in limbo
further the <unk> seemed torn editorially between keeping its old - time <unk> readership blue - collar and sports - oriented and trying to provide a sprightly upscale alternative to the sometimes staid <unk>
<unk> had flirted with a conversion to tabloid format for years but never executed the plan
the <unk> joins the <unk> <unk> - <unk> which folded and the <unk> <unk> - <unk> which was sold as cornerstones of the old <unk> newspaper empire abandoned by the company in the n
many felt <unk> <unk> kept the paper alive as long as it did if marginally because of its place in family history
its fanciful offices were designed by architect <unk> <unk> who built the <unk> castle at <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> had kept an apartment in the spanish <unk> - style building
analysts said <unk> the <unk> demise does n't necessarily represent the overall condition of the newspaper industry
the <unk> was a survivor from a bygone age said <unk> <unk> <unk> a media analyst with <unk> <unk>
actually the long deterioration in daily newspapers shows signs of coming to an end and the industry looks pretty healthy
founded as the <unk> in <unk> by <unk> <unk> the <unk> was crippled by a bitter decade - long strike that began in <unk> and cut circulation in half
financially it never recovered editorially it had its moments
in <unk> <unk> hired editor <unk> <unk> who brightened the editorial product considerably
he and his successor <unk> <unk> <unk> restored respect for the editorial product and though in recent years the paper had been limping along on limited resources its accomplishments were notable
for example the <unk> consistently beat its much - larger rival on disclosures about <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> financial dealings
the <unk> sports coverage and arts criticism were also highly regarded
<unk> <unk> <unk> vice president and general manager of <unk> newspapers stood up in the paper newsroom yesterday and announced that no buyers had stepped forward and that the paper would fold putting more than n full - time employees out of work
<unk> said n it would provide employees with a placement service and pay them for n days
some long - tenured employees will receive additional benefits the company said n
hours after the announcement representatives of the <unk> <unk> <unk> were in a bar across the street recruiting
the reaction in the newsroom was emotional
i never seen so many people crying in one place at one time said <unk> <unk> an assistant city editor
so <unk> <unk> was chosen as the paper final headline
i doing the main story and i already two beers drunk said reporter <unk> <unk> whom the <unk> hired away several years ago but who returned to the <unk> out of preference
his wife also works for the paper as did his father
outside a young pressman filling a news box with an extra edition headlined <unk> <unk> <unk> refused to take a reader quarter
forget it he said as he handed her a paper
it does n't make any difference now
<unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> it did n't make a n million semiannual interest payment due yesterday on n million of senior subordinated debentures
the radio - station owner and programmer said <unk> it was trying to obtain additional working capital from its senior secured lenders and other financial institutions
it said <unk> it needs to make the payment by <unk> n to avoid a default that could lead to an acceleration of the debt
in <unk> the company said <unk> it was seeking offers for its five radio stations in order to concentrate on its programming business
if you really rather have a <unk> do n't leave home without the <unk> <unk> card
or so the slogan might go
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> motors <unk> beleaguered <unk> division are joining forces in a promotion aimed at boosting <unk> sales while encouraging broader use of the <unk> <unk> card
the companies are giving four - day vacations for two to <unk> buyers who charge all or part of their down payments on the <unk> <unk> green card
they have begun sending letters explaining the program which began <unk> n and will end <unk> n to about five million card holders
neither company would disclose the program cost
<unk> approached <unk> <unk> about a joint promotion because its card holders generally have a good credit history and are good at making payments says a spokeswoman for the division
<unk> <unk> also represents the upscale image n we trying to project she adds
<unk> has been seeking for the past few years to restore its reputation as the doctor car a product for upscale professionals
sales were roughly flat in the n model year compared with a year earlier though industry sales fell
but since the <unk> model year began <unk> n <unk> sales have plunged n
for <unk> <unk> the promotion is part of an effort to broaden the use of its card for retail sales where the company expects to get much of the future growth in its card business
traditionally the card has been used mainly for travel and entertainment expenses
<unk> <unk> an <unk> <unk> executive vice president says n the promotion with <unk> is his company first with an auto maker but hopefully will be the first of many in the company effort to promote its green card as the total car - care card
to that end <unk> <unk> has been signing up gasoline companies car repair shops tire companies and car dealers to accept the card
many auto dealers now let car buyers charge part or all of their purchase on the <unk> <unk> card but few card holders realize this <unk> <unk> says <unk>
until now however buyers who wanted to finance part of a car purchase through <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> could n't put their down payment on a charge card because of possible conflicts with truth - in-lending and state disclosure laws over finance rates says a spokesman for the <unk> finance arm
but <unk> approved the <unk> program he says n because the <unk> <unk> green card requires payment in full upon billing and so does n't carry any finance rates
<unk> <unk> says <unk> <unk> <unk> considers <unk> and <unk> very sophisticated direct - mail marketers so by joining forces with them we have managed to maximize our direct - mail capability
in addition <unk> is a relatively respected nameplate among <unk> <unk> card holders says n an <unk> <unk> spokeswoman
when the company asked members in a mailing which cars they would like to get information about for possible future purchases <unk> came in fourth among <unk> cars and in the top n of all cars the spokeswoman says n
<unk> <unk> has more than n million card holders in the <unk> and over half have the green card
<unk> screened the card - member list for holders more than n years old with household incomes over <unk> who had n't missed any payments the <unk> spokeswoman says n
some n million of the five million who will get letters were preapproved for credit with <unk>
these n million people also are eligible to get one percentage point off <unk> advertised finance rates which start at n for two - year loan contracts
a spokesman for <unk> <unk> <unk> subsidiary says <unk> his company is using promotions to increase use of its cards but does n't have plans for a tie - in similar to the <unk> <unk> - <unk> link
three divisions at <unk> <unk> are working with <unk> on the promotion the establishment services division which is responsible for all merchants and companies that accept the card the travel division and the merchandise sales division
the vacation packages include hotel accommodations and in some cases tours or tickets to local attractions but not meals
destinations are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
a buyer who chooses to fly to his destination must pay for his own ticket but gets a companion ticket free if they fly on <unk> <unk>
in lieu of the vacation buyers can choose among several prizes including a grandfather clock or a stereo videocassette recorder
<unk> holders who receive the letter also are eligible for a sweepstakes with <unk> cars or a <unk> vacation as prizes
if they test - drive a <unk> they get an <unk> <unk> calculator
this is n't <unk> first travel - related promotion
a few years ago the company offered two round - trip tickets on <unk> <unk> airlines to buyers of its <unk> luxury car
the promotion helped <unk> sales exceed the division forecast by more than <unk> <unk> said n at the time
the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> declared illegal a variety of interest - rate swap transactions and options deals between a <unk> borough council and commercial banks
the ruling could lead to the cancellation of huge bank debts n the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> ran up after losing heavily on swap transactions
as many as <unk> <unk> and international banks stand to lose several hundred million pounds should the decision be upheld and set a precedent for other municipalities
an appeal is expected
in response to the ruling gilt futures swiftly plunged more than a point yesterday before recovering much of the loss by the end of the session
gilts or british government bonds which also fell sharply initially retraced some of the losses to end about <unk> point lower
the council which is alleged to have engaged in over <unk> deals valued at over <unk> billion n billion lost millions of pounds from soured swap deals
at one point <unk> is reported to have accounted for as much as <unk> of the sterling market in interest - rate swap dealings
when two parties engage in an interest - rate swap they are betting against each other on future rates
thus an institution obligated to make fixed - rate interest payments on debt swaps the payments with another making floating - rate payments
in most of the british transactions the municipalities agreed to make floating - rate payments to banks which would make fixed - rate payments
as interest rates rose municipalities owed the banks more than the banks were paying them
the court hearing began in early <unk> at the request of <unk> <unk> district auditor for <unk> who argued that local councils are n't vested with constitutional authority to engage in such capital - markets activities
the council backed the audit commission stand that the swap transactions are illegal
although the <unk> and <unk> council was by far the most active local authority engaging in such capital - markets transactions the court decision could set a precedent for similar transactions by <unk> other local councils
while this court ruling was only on <unk> it will obviously be very persuasive in other cases of a similar nature a solicitor representing one of the banks said
already n local councils have refused to honor fees and payments to banks incurred during various swaps dealings
other financial institutions involved include <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
if the banks exhaust all avenues of appeal it is possible that they would seek to have the illegality ruling work both ways some market sources said n
banks could seek to recover payments to local authorities in instances where the banks made net payments to councils
officials from the various banks involved are expected to meet during the next few days to consider other arrangements with local authorities that could be questionable
the banks have n days n to file an appeal against the ruling and are expected to do so shortly
in the aftermath of the stock market gut - wrenching n drop on <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> n stockbrokers across the country began a telephone and letter - writing campaign aimed at quashing the country second - largest program trader
the target of their wrath
their own employer <unk> <unk>
since <unk> minicrash <unk> <unk> has been shaken by an explosion of resentment against program trading the computer - driven lightning - fast trades of huge baskets of stocks and futures that can send stock prices reeling in minutes
but the heated fight over program trading is about much more than a volatile stock market
the real battle is over who will control that market and reap its huge rewards
<unk> trading itself according to many academics who have studied it is merely caught in the middle of this battle unfairly labeled as the evil driving force of the marketplace
the evidence indicates that program trading did n't in fact cause the market sharp fall on <unk> n though it may have exacerbated it
on one side of this power struggle stand the forces in ascendency on <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> consisting of high - tech computer wizards at the major brokerage firms their pension fund clients with immense pools of money and the traders at the fast - growing <unk> futures exchanges
these are the main proponents of program trading
defending their ramparts are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the traditional stock - picking money managers tens of thousands of stock brokers the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> listed companies and the clannish floor traders known as specialists who make markets in their stocks
so far <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> seems to be winning the program - trading battle successfully mobilizing public and congressional opinion to bludgeon their tormentors
the <unk> <unk> <unk> a major futures marketplace yesterday announced the addition of another layer of trading halts designed to slow program traders during a rapidly falling stock market and the <unk> <unk> is expected today to approve some additional restrictions on program trading
stung by charges that their greed is turning the stock market into a gigantic crapshoot almost all the big investment banking houses have abandoned index arbitrage a common form of program trading for their own accounts in the past few days
a few such as giant <unk> <unk> <unk> now refuse even to do index arbitrage trades for clients
the <unk> <unk> assault on program trading and its practitioners has been fierce and broad - based in part because some <unk> <unk> members feel n their very livelihood is at stake
some such as traditional money manager <unk> <unk> have taken out national newspaper advertisements demanding that market regulators stop the numbers racket on <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> stock specialists in a bold palace revolt began shortly after <unk> n to telephone the corporate executives of the companies whose stock is listed on the <unk> <unk> to have them pressure the exchange to ban program trading
<unk> <unk> the chairman of <unk> <unk> who is rallying other ceos to the anti - program trading cause says n he has received countless letters offering support
they said universally without a single exception do n't even compromise
kill it he says
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is n't likely to take all this lying down for long however
its new products and trading techniques have been highly profitable
program trading money managers have gained control over a big chunk of the invested funds in this country and the pressures on such money managers to produce consistent profits has wedded them to the ability to move rapidly in and out the market that program trading gives them
what more the last time <unk> major <unk> <unk> firms said n they were getting out of program trading in the aftermath of the <unk> crash they waited a few months and then sneaked back into it
even some members of the <unk> <unk> despite their current advantage seem to be conceding that the future belongs with the <unk> <unk>
last week <unk> <unk> <unk> one of the <unk> <unk> most respected floor traders and head of a major traders organization surrendered
he sold his exchange seat and wrote a bitter letter to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in which he said n the <unk> <unk> is too focused on machines rather than people
he said <unk> the exchange is headed for a real crisis if program trading is n't curbed
i do not want my money invested in what i consider as nothing more than a casino <unk> <unk> wrote
the battle has turned into a civil war at some firms and organizations causing internal contradictions and pitting employee against employee
at <unk> a unit of <unk> <unk> <unk> and other big brokerage firms stockbrokers battle their own firm program traders a few floors away
corporations like <unk> denounce program trading yet <unk> has in the past hired pension fund managers like bankers <unk> <unk> that are also big program traders
the <unk> <unk> the nation premier stock exchange is sharply divided between its floor traders and its top executives
its entrenched n stock specialists firms are fighting tooth and nail against programs
but the <unk> <unk> leadership over the specialists protests two weeks ago began trading a new stock basket product designed to facilitate program trading
a lot of people would like to go back to <unk> before program trading <unk> <unk> said n this week
i would like to go back to n
but we are not going back to n
again and again program - trading critics raise the casino theme
they say n greedy market manipulators have made a shambles of the nation free - enterprise system turning the stock market into a big gambling den with the odds heavily stacked against the small investor
the public did n't come to the market to play a game they can go to <unk> - <unk> betting for that says n a. <unk> <unk> chairman of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a traditional money management firm
the program traders on the other hand portray old - fashioned stock pickers as the neanderthals of the industry
critics like <unk> <unk> are looking for witches and people who use computers to trade are a convenient boogieman says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> firm that runs a n million fund that uses index arbitrage
just a blind fear of the unknown is causing them to beg the regulators for protection
for all the furor there is nothing particularly complex about the concept of stock - index arbitrage the most controversial type of computer - assisted program trading
like other forms of arbitrage it merely seeks to take advantage of momentary discrepancies in the price of a single product in this case a basket of stocks in different markets in this case the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> futures markets
that divergence is what stock index traders seek
when it occurs the traders place orders via computers to buy the basket of stocks such as the <unk> stocks that constitute the <unk> <unk> <unk> stock index in whichever market is cheaper and sell them in the more expensive market they lock in the difference in price as profit
such program trades which can involve the purchase or sale of millions of dollars of stock occur in a matter of seconds
a program trade of n million of stock typically earns a razor - thin profit of <unk>
to keep program - trading units profitable in the eyes of senior brokerage executives traders must seize every opportunity <unk> their computers find
the speed with which such program trades take place and the volatile price movements n they can cause are what program trading critics profess to despise
if you continue to do this the investor becomes frightened any investor the odd lotter mutual funds and pension funds says <unk> <unk> managing partner at <unk> <unk>
but many experts and traders say that program trading is n't the main reason for stock - market gyrations
i have not seen one iota of evidence n to support restrictions on program trading says <unk> a <unk> <unk> finance professor <unk> <unk> an authority on the subject
says the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is greater than program trading
the <unk> n plunge was triggered not by program traders but by news of the unraveling of the <unk> billion buy - out of <unk> <unk>
unable to unload <unk> and other airline shares takeover - stock speculators or risk arbitragers dumped every blue - chip stock <unk> they had
while program trades swiftly kicked in a circuit breaker that halted trading in stock futures in <unk> made some program trading impossible
<unk> <unk> <unk> head trader at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> says <unk> critics are ignoring the role n the takeover stock speculator is taking in the market as a source of volatility
many arbs are overleveraged she says n and they have to sell when things look like they fall apart
like virtually everything on <unk> <unk> the program - trading battle is over money and the traditionalists have been losing out on bundles of it to the <unk> <unk> in recent years
take the traditional money managers or stock pickers as they are derisively known among the computer jockeys
traditional stock managers like to charge <unk> cents to n cents for every n n they manage for big institutional investors and higher fees for smaller investors
yet many such managers consistently fail to even keep up with much less beat the returns of standard benchmarks like the
not surprisingly old - style money managers have been losing clients to giant stock - index funds that use computers to juggle portfolios so they mirror the <unk> <unk>
the indexers charge only a few pennies per <unk> managed
today about <unk> billion or <unk> of all pension - fund stock investments is held by index funds
the new <unk> <unk> of computers and automated trading threatens to make dinosaurs of the <unk> <unk> <unk> stock - specialist firms
these small but influential floor brokers long have earned fat returns of <unk> to <unk> a year on their capital by virtue of their monopoly in making markets in individual stocks
the specialists see any step to electronic trading as a death knell
and they believe <unk> the <unk> <unk> under <unk> <unk> has abandoned their interest
the son of a specialist and once one himself <unk> <unk> has nonetheless been striving with products like the new stock basket that his former colleagues dislike so much to keep index funds and other program traders from taking their business to overseas markets
meanwhile specialists trading risks have skyrocketed as a result of stock - market volatility
when the sell programs hit you can hear the order printers start to go on the <unk> <unk> trading floor says n one specialist there
the buyers walk away and the specialist is left alone as the buyer of last resort for his stable of stocks he contends n
no one is more unhappy with program trading than the nation stockbrokers
they are still trying to lure back small investors spooked by the <unk> stock - market crash and the market swings since then
small investors are absolutely dismayed that <unk> <unk> is stacking the deck against them and these wide swings are scaring them to death says <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman of regional broker <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>
stockbrokers business and pay has been falling
last year the average broker earned <unk> <unk> lower than in <unk>
corporate executives resent that their company stock has been transformed into a nameless piece of a stock - index basket
index traders who buy all n stocks in the <unk> <unk> often do n't even know what the companies <unk> they own actually do complains <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman of <unk> <unk> <unk>
do you make sweatshirts or sparkplugs
oh you in the paper business is one reaction <unk> <unk> <unk> says <unk> he gotten from his big institutional shareholders
by this <unk> program traders were doing a record n of the <unk> <unk> average daily trading volume
among the top practitioners were <unk> <unk> blue bloods <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> brothers <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
but then came <unk> n and the negative publicity orchestrated by the <unk> <unk> particularly against index arbitrage
the indexers strategy for the moment is to hunker down and let the furor die
there a lynch - mob psychology right now says the top program - trading official at a <unk> <unk> firm
<unk> <unk> cash cow has been gored but i do n't think <unk> anyone has proven that index arbitrage is the problem
too much money is at stake for program traders to give up
for example stock - index futures began trading in <unk> in <unk> and within two years they were the fastest - growing futures contract ever launched
stock futures trading has minted dozens of millionaires in their n and n
now on a good day <unk> stock - index traders trade more dollars worth of stock futures than the <unk> <unk> trades in stock
now the stage is set for the battle to play out
the anti - programmers are getting some helpful thunder from <unk>
program traders power to create total panic is so great that they ca n't be allowed to have their way says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>
we have to have a system that says to those largest investors
sit down
you will not panic
you will not put the financial system in jeopardy
but the prospects for legislation that targets program trading is unlikely anytime soon
many people including the <unk> <unk> think that it too late to put the genie back in the bottle
the <unk> <unk> directors meet today to approve some program - trading restrictions but a total ban is n't being considered <unk> <unk> officials say n
you not going to stop the idea of trading a basket of stocks says <unk> <unk> . <unk>
program trading is here to stay and computers are here to stay and we just need to understand it
<unk> of a total ban some anti - programmers have proposed several middle - ground reforms which they say n would take away certain advantages n program traders currently enjoy in the marketplace that other investors do n't
one such proposal regarding stock - index futures is an increase in the margin requirement or the good - faith payment of cash needed to trade them to about the same level as the margin requirement for stocks
currently margins on stock futures purchases are much lower roughly <unk> compared with n for stocks making the futures market much faster and potentially more speculative
program trading critics also want the <unk> <unk> <unk> rather than the futures industry to set such margins
futures traders respond that low margins help keep their markets active
higher margins would chase away dozens of smaller traders who help larger traders buy and sell they say
another proposed reform is to have program traders answer to an uptick rule a reform instituted after the great <unk> of <unk> that protects against stocks being relentlessly beaten downward by those seeking to profit from lower prices namely short sellers
the <unk> <unk> uptick rule prevents the short sale of a stock when the stock is falling in price
but in <unk> program traders received what amounted to an exemption from the uptick rule in certain situations to make it easier to link the stock and futures markets
a reinstatement of the uptick rule for program traders would slow their activity considerably
program traders argue that a reinstatement of the rule would destroy the pricing efficiency of the futures and stock markets
<unk> <unk> <unk> contributed to this article
fundamentalists
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said yesterday that he could support letting federal regulators suspend program trading during wild stock - price swings
thus the band - wagon psychology of recent days picks up new impetus
index arbitrage is a common form of program trading
as usually practiced it takes advantage of a rather basic concept two separate markets in different locations trading basically the same widgets ca n't trade them for long at prices that are widely different
in index arbitrage the widget is the <unk> <unk> and its price is constantly compared between the futures market in <unk> and the stock markets largely in <unk> <unk>
to profit from an index - arbitrage opportunity someone who owns the <unk> <unk> widget in <unk> <unk> must sell it and replace it with a cheaper <unk> <unk> widget in <unk>
if the money manager performing this service is being paid by his clients to match or beat the return of the <unk> <unk> index he is likely to remain fully invested at all times
few if any index - fund managers will risk leveraging performance by owning more than <unk> exposure to stocks and equally few will want to own less than a n position should stocks rise
by constantly seeking to own the cheapest widget index - arbitrage traders hope to add between <unk> and <unk> to the annual return of the <unk> <unk>
that represents a very thin excess return certainly far less than what most fundamental stock pickers claim to seek as their performance objective
the fact that a vast majority of fundamentalist money managers fail to beat the <unk> <unk> may contribute to the hysteria surrounding the issue
as more managers pursue the index - arbitrage strategy these small opportunities between markets will be reduced and eventually eliminated
the current opportunities arise because the process for executing a buy or sell order in the actual stocks that make up the <unk> <unk> is more cumbersome than transacting in the futures market
the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> attempt to introduce a new portfolio basket is evidence of investors desires to make fast and easy transactions of large numbers of shares
so if index arbitrage is simply taking advantage of thin inefficiencies between two markets for the same widget how did program trading evolve into the evil creature that is evoking the curses of so many observers
all arguments against program trading even those pressed without fact conclude with three expected results after reforms are implemented <unk> reduced volatility <unk> a long - term investment focus and n a level playing field for the small investor
but many of these reforms are unneeded even harmful
reducing volatility
an index - arbitrage trade is never executed unless there is sufficient difference between the markets in <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to cover all transaction costs
arbitrage does n't cause volatility it responds to it
think about what causes the difference in prices between the two markets for <unk> <unk> stocks usually it is large investors initiating a buy or sell in <unk>
a large investor will likely cause the futures market to decline when he sells his futures
arbitrage simply transfers his selling pressure from <unk> to <unk> <unk> while functioning as a buyer in <unk>
the start of the whole process is the key someone must fundamentally increase or decrease his ownership in widgets to make widget prices move
why does this large hypothetical seller trade in <unk> instead of <unk> <unk>
perhaps he is willing to sacrifice to the arbitrage trader some small profit in order to get quick and certain execution of his large trade
in a competitive market this investor has many ways n to execute his transactions and he will have more alternatives both foreign and domestic if his volume is profitable n for an exchange to handle
if not <unk> then in <unk> <unk> if not the <unk> then overseas
volatility surrounding his trades occurs not because of index arbitrage but because his is a large addition or subtraction to a widget market with finite liquidity
eliminate arbitrage and liquidity will decline instead of rising creating more volatility instead of less
the speed of his transaction is n't to be feared either because faster and cleaner execution is desirable not loathsome
if slowing things down could reduce volatility stone tablets should become the trade ticket of the future
encouraging long - term investing
we must be very cautious about labeling investors as long - term or short - term
policies designed to encourage one type of investor over another are akin to placing a sign over the <unk> <unk> door saying buyers welcome sellers please go away
the ultimate goal of any investor is a profit motive and regulators should not concern themselves with whether investors are sufficiently focused on the long term
a free market with a profit motive will attract each investor to the liquidity and risks n he can tolerate
in point of fact volatility as measured by the annualized standard deviation of daily stock price movements has frequently been much higher than it is today
periods before the advent of futures or program trading were often more volatile usually when fundamental market conditions were undergoing change <unk> <unk> and <unk> for example
it is interesting to see the fundamental stock pickers scream foul on program trading when the markets decline while hailing the great values still abounding as the markets rise
could rising volatility possibly be related to uncertainty about the economics of stocks instead of the evil deeds of program - trading goblins
some of the proposed fixes for what is labeled program - trading volatility could be far worse than the perceived problem
in using program trading as a whipping boy fundamentalist investors stand to gain the high ground in wooing small investors for their existing stock - selection products
they may however risk bringing some damaging interference from outside the markets themselves
how does a nice new tax say <unk> on any financial transaction sound
that ought to make sure n we all thinking for the long term
getting a level playing field
this argument is perhaps the most interesting one for abolishing program trading not because of its merits but because of the firms championing the cause
the loudest of these reformers are money managers who cater to smaller investors
they continually advise their clients on which individual stocks to buy or sell while their clients continue to hope for superior performance
even with mutual funds the little investor continues to tolerate high fees high commissions and poor performance while index - fund managers slowly amass a better record with lower fees lower commissions and less risk
yet our efforts are somehow less noble than those of an investment expert studiously devouring press clippings on each company n he follows
almost all new regulation is introduced in the interests of protecting the little guy and he invariably is the one least able to cope with its consequences
if spreads available from index arbitrage are so enormous surely any sizable mutual - fund company could profit from offering it to small investors
the sad reality is that the retail investor continues to pursue stellar performers first while leaving institutions to grapple with basis points of performance on large sums of money quarter by quarter
cost - effective index funds just are n't sexy enough to justify the high fees and commissions that retail customers frequently pay and that institutional customers refuse to pay
each new trading roadblock is likely to be beaten by institutions seeking better ways n to serve their high - volume clients here or overseas
legislating new trading inefficiencies will only make things harder on the least sophisticated investors
so what is next for program trading
left to its own devices index arbitrage will become more and more efficient making it harder and harder n to do profitably
spreads will become so tight that it wo n't matter which market an investor chooses arbitrage will prevent him from gaining any temporary profit
if government or private watchdogs insist however on introducing greater friction between the markets limits on price moves two - tiered execution higher margin requirements taxation etc . the end loser will be the markets themselves
instead we ought to be inviting more liquidity with cheaper ways n to trade and transfer capital among all participants

some democrats in <unk> are warning that a complicated new funding device for the two federal antitrust agencies could result in further cutbacks in a regulatory area already reduced sharply in recent years
the funding mechanism which has received congressional approval and is expected to be signed by <unk> <unk> would affect the antitrust operations of the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
as a part of overall efforts to reduce spending <unk> cut by n million the <unk> administration request for antitrust enforcement for fiscal n which began <unk> n
to offset the reduction <unk> approved a <unk> fee that investors and companies will have to pay each time n they make required filings to antitrust regulators about mergers acquisitions and certain other transactions
some democrats led by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> unsuccessfully opposed the measure because they fear that the fees may not fully make up for the budget cuts
but <unk> <unk> and <unk> officials said <unk> they expect the filing fees to make up for the budget reductions and possibly exceed them
it could operate to augment our budget <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> antitrust chief said in an interview
under measures approved by both houses of <unk> the administration request for n million for the <unk> <unk> would be cut n million
the <unk> budget request of n million about n million of which would go for antitrust enforcement would also be cut by n million
the administration had requested roughly the same amount for antitrust enforcement for fiscal <unk> as was appropriated in fiscal <unk>
the offsetting fees would apply to filings made under the <unk> - <unk> <unk>
under that law parties proposing mergers or acquisitions valued at n million or more must notify <unk> and <unk> <unk> antitrust regulators before completing the transactions
currently the government charges nothing for such filings
proponents of the funding arrangement predict that based on recent filing levels of more than <unk> a year the fees will yield at least n million this fiscal year or n million more than the budget cuts
when you do that there is not a cut but there is in fact a program increase of n million each for the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> during <unk> debate
but <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> responded that a recession could stifle merger activity reducing the amount of fees collected
the antitrust staffs of both the <unk> and <unk> <unk> were cut more than <unk> in the <unk> administration and enforcement of major merger cases fell off drastically during that period
today is not the time <unk> to signal that <unk> in any way sanctions the dismal state into which antitrust enforcement has fallen <unk> <unk> argued n

a. <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> investor who says <unk> the stock market fluctuations and gyrations give me the heebie - jeebies does n't see much point in outlawing program trading
those who still want to do it will just find some way n to get around any attempt to curb it
similarly <unk> <unk> a <unk> asset manager for a <unk> real - estate firm would like to see program trading disappear because i ca n't see that it does anything for the market or the country

also in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> an insurance - company lawyer comments that program trading increases volatility but i do n't think n it should be banned

he adds that his shares in a company savings plan are invested in a mutual fund and volatility on a given day may hurt the fund

if you were a short - term investor you might be more leery about program trading
<unk> <unk> of <unk> defends program trading because he believes that it can bring the market back up after a plunge

researchers at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> reported n they raised the electrical current - carrying capacity of new superconductor crystals by a factor of <unk> moving the materials closer to commercial use
the scientists said n they created small changes in the crystal - lattice structures of the superconductors to raise the amount of current that single crystals could carry to <unk> amps per square centimeter in a moderately strong magnetic field
the scientists said <unk> they made the advance with yttrium - containing superconductors cooled to liquid - nitrogen temperature or minus n degrees fahrenheit
their report appears in today issue of the journal <unk>
the finding marks a significant step in research on bulk superconductors which are aimed at use in wires for motors magnets generators and other applications
scientists had obtained even higher current - carrying capacity in thin films of the new superconductors but have had problems increasing the amount of current that bulk crystals could carry
superconductors conduct electricity without resistance when cooled
a family of ceramic superconductors discovered during the past three years promise new technologies such as cheaper electrical generation but only if their current - carrying capacity can be raised
the <unk> advance shows how one aspect of the current - carrying problem can be overcome
but it wo n't lead to imminent use of new superconductors cautioned <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> one of the <unk> researchers
he added that the current - carrying capacity of multi - crystal samples of superconductors remains too low for most practical uses because of so - called weak links between crystals
such multi - crystal materials will probably be needed for commercial applications
<unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> the <unk> team created the desired crystal changes by bombarding superconductor samples with neutrons a process that creates some radioactivity in the samples and may not be feasible for large - scale commercial use
still scientists breathed a collective sigh of relief about the finding because it demonstrates how to overcome the flux pinning problem that earlier this year was widely publicized as undercutting new superconductors potential
the problem involves the motion of small magnetic fields within superconductor crystals limiting their current - carrying capacity
<unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> the crystal changes n his team introduced apparently pins the magnetic fields in place preventing them from lowering current - carrying capacity
<unk> <unk> <unk> added that researchers are trying to determine precisely what crystal changes solved the problem
determining that may enable them to develop better ways n to introduce the needed crystal - lattice patterns
the <unk> team also is trying to combine their latest superconductor process with melt - textured growth a process discovered earlier at <unk> laboratories
the combined processes may significantly raise the current - carrying capacity of multi - crystal samples

small wonder since he asking <unk> <unk> taxpayers to sink up to n million into the new stadium
as <unk> <unk> digs out from the <unk> <unk> one opponents say n the last thing n the city can afford is an expensive new stadium
a stadium craze is sweeping the country
it fueled by the increasing profitability of major - league teams
something like one - third of the nation n largest cities are thinking about new stadiums ranging from <unk> to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
most boosters claim <unk> the new sports complexes will be moneymakers for their city
<unk> <unk> economist <unk> <unk> scoffs at that
he has looked at n baseball and football stadiums and found that only one private <unk> <unk> brought more money into a city than it took out
stadiums tend to redistribute existing wealth within a community not create more of it
voters generally agree when they are given a chance to decide if they want to sink their own tax dollars into a new mega - stadium
<unk> <unk> voters rejected a new ballpark two years ago
last month <unk> voters turned thumbs down on a n million stadium bond and tax proposition
its backers fielded every important interest on their team a popular mayor the <unk> of <unk> the major media and spent n on promotion
but voters decided that if the stadium was such a good idea someone would build it himself and rejected it <unk> to n
in <unk> <unk> its backers concede <unk> the ballpark is at best running even in the polls
<unk> <unk> the former <unk> <unk> mayor who built <unk> <unk> for the giants in the <unk> wo n't endorse the new ballpark
he says <unk> he had <unk> built because the <unk> claimed n they needed n parking spaces
since the new park will have only n spaces <unk> <unk> thinks <unk> backers are playing some fiscal games of their own with the voters
stadium boosters claim that without public money they would never be built
<unk> <unk> owner <unk> <unk> disagrees and he can prove it
several years ago he gave up trying to persuade <unk> to improve its city - owned <unk> <unk> and instead built his own <unk> million coliseum with private funds
he did n't see why the taxpayers should help build something <unk> he would then use to turn a healthy profit
this stadium shows that anything n government can do we can do better <unk> <unk> says
but to <unk> <unk> the former <unk> <unk> mayor who helped build that city cavernous money - losing <unk> questions of who benefits or the bottom line are of little relevance
the <unk> is an exercise in optimism a statement of faith he has said
it is the very building of it that is important not how much of it is used or its economics
an egyptian <unk> could n't have justified his pyramids any better
but civilization has moved forward since then
today taxpayers get to vote most of the time on whether they want to finance the building schemes of our modern political pharaohs or let private money erect these playgrounds for public passions

earnings were hurt by disposal of operations in its restructuring <unk> said <unk>
<unk> <unk> big securities firms face the prospect of having their credit ratings lowered
the reason risks from the firms new merchant banking activities are rising as revenue from the industry traditional business erodes
the downgrading of debt issued by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> parent of <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> investors <unk> <unk> coupled with a <unk> announcement that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is under review for a possible downgrade sent shivers through the brokerage community this week
with the shudders came the realization that some of <unk> <unk> biggest players are struggling to maintain the stellar credit standing required to finance their activities profitably
securities firms are among the biggest issuers of commercial paper or short - term corporate ious which they sell to finance their daily operations
the biggest firms still retain the highest ratings on their commercial paper
but <unk> warned that <unk> commercial paper rating could be lowered soon a move that would reduce <unk> profit margins on its borrowings and signal trouble ahead for other firms
<unk> is n by <unk> <unk> <unk>
just as the <unk> bull market transformed the <unk> securities business so too will the more difficult environment of the <unk> says <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> vice president
a sweeping restructuring of the industry is possible
<unk> <unk> <unk> says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in particular are likely to have difficulty shoring up their credit standing in months ahead
what worries credit - rating concerns the most is that <unk> <unk> firms are taking long - term risks with their own capital via leveraged buy - out and junk bond financings
that a departure from their traditional practice of transferring almost all financing risks to investors
whereas conventional securities financings are structured to be sold quickly <unk> <unk> new penchant for leveraged buy - outs and junk bonds is resulting in long - term lending commitments that stretch out for months or years
the recent disarray in the junk bond market suggests that brokers may become longer - term creditors than they anticipated and may face long delays in getting their money back says <unk> <unk> <unk> a vice president at <unk> which raised a warning flag for the industry in <unk> when it downgraded <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is facing a n situation says <unk> <unk> of <unk>
<unk> banking where firms commit their own money is getting riskier and there less of it n to go around
in addition he says the buy - out business is under pressure because of the junk bond collapse meaning that returns are likely to decline as the volume of junk - bond financings shrinks
in a leveraged buy - out a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing with the expectation that the debt will be paid with funds generated by the acquired company operations or sales of its assets
in a recent report <unk> said <unk> it expects intense competition to occur through the rest of the century in the securities industry which combined with overcapacity will create poor prospects for profitability
it said that the temptation for managements to ease this profit pressure by taking greater risks is an additional rating factor
both <unk> and <unk> cited <unk> <unk> reliance in recent years on merchant banking which has been responsible for a significant portion of the closely held firm profit
the recent cash squeeze at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> most lucrative client of the decade is proving costly to <unk> <unk> because it arranged more than <unk> billion of high - yield high - risk junk financings for <unk> units
in addition a big loan that <unk> <unk> made to <unk> <unk> <unk> was n't repaid on time when its <unk> million junk financing for a buy - out of the bedding company was withdrawn
these two exposures alone represent a very substantial portion of <unk> <unk> <unk> equity <unk> said
total merchant banking exposures are in excess of the firm equity
<unk> <unk> <unk> however benefits from the backing of its largest shareholder <unk> <unk> <unk> third largest bank
<unk> also has been an aggressive participant in the leveraged buy - out business
but its earnings became a major disappointment as its traditional retail or individual investor business showed no signs of rebounding from the slump that followed the <unk> n stock market crash
in addition <unk> listed <unk> billion of capital is overstated according to the rating concerns because it includes <unk> billion of goodwill
<unk> really only has n million of capital says <unk> <unk> of <unk>
a <unk> spokesman said n the firm is n't worried
a year ago <unk> also had <unk> under review for possible downgrade he said
after two months of talks our rating was maintained
<unk> meanwhile already competes at a disadvantage to its big <unk> <unk> rivals because it has a slightly lower commercial paper rating
the collapse of junk bond prices and the cancellation of many junk bond financings apparently have taken their toll on closely held <unk> the leading underwriter in that market
the firm also has been hit with big financial settlements with the government stemming from its guilty plea to six felonies related to a big insider - trading scandal
<unk> this year eliminated its retail or individual customer business cutting the firm workforce almost in half to just over <unk>
recently <unk> circulated a private financial statement among several securities firms showing that its earnings performance has diminished this year from previous years
the firm capital moreover has n't grown at the same rate as in the past officials at these firms say n
<unk> remains confident of its future creditworthiness
we well positioned with n billion of capital a <unk> spokesman said n
and as a leading investment and merchant banking firm the fact that we are no longer subject to the uncertainties and vicissitudes of the retail business is a major plus in our view
moreover we probably been the most aggressive firm on the street in reducing costs which are down around <unk> over the last six months
<unk> <unk> <unk> the father of the team that created the highly successful <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> cars retired early after experiencing recent heart problems
most recently <unk> <unk> <unk> years old has been vice president of product and manufacturing engineering at <unk> <unk> <unk>
but he is best known in the auto industry as the creator of a team car - development approach that produced the two midsized cars that were instrumental in helping the no . n auto maker record profits in recent years and in enabling the company <unk> division to eclipse <unk> motors <unk> <unk> division as the top - selling nameplate in the <unk>
under the so - called <unk> <unk> approach <unk> <unk> and other <unk> product planners sought the involvement of parts suppliers assembly - line workers auto designers and financial staff members from the initial stages of the development cycle
the concept goal was to eliminate bureaucracy and make <unk> product development more responsive to consumer demands
it was later applied to other new - car programs including those that produced the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said yesterday that <unk> <unk> has helped to change the world perception of american - made cars
<unk> <unk> worked at <unk> for n years holding a variety of car and parts - engineering positions
the limits to legal absurdity stretched another notch this week when the <unk> <unk> refused to hear an appeal from a case that says n corporate defendants must pay damages even after proving that they could not possibly have caused the harm
we can understand and share the compassion that makes judges sometimes wish to offer a kind of solomonic aid to those who been hurt
but this case is a stark lesson in how the failures of the traditional policy - making process have left the courts as the only forum n this country has n to debate risk technology and innovation
too often now a single court decision becomes the precedent for other less compelling cases
from the <unk> until n some two million women took the synthetic hormone diethylstilbestrol <unk> to prevent miscarriages and morning sickness
the drug was approved by the <unk> and <unk> <unk> and marketed by some n pharmaceutical companies often under generic labels
in the <unk> scientists reported cancer cases among the daughters of <unk> users
the cases quickly went to court but the mothers of several thousand <unk> plaintiffs could n't recall whose brand they used
beginning in <unk> courts in several states including <unk> and <unk> <unk> decided to suspend the common - law rule that plaintiffs must prove that the defendants are the ones who are liable
courts made the assumption that all <unk> pills were essentially the same and created a market - share test so that damages would be assessed against drug makers in the proportion of their share of the original sales
this has some logic
drug makers should n't be able to duck liability because people could n't identify precisely which identical drug was used
but courts quickly tumbled down a slippery slope
just as all plaintiffs are not alike it turns out that <unk> defendants marketed the drugs differently and may have offered different warranties
the ultimate result came in <unk> v. <unk> where the highest <unk> <unk> court expanded the market - share approach for the first time to say that drug makers that could prove <unk> <unk> <unk> mother did n't use their pill must still pay their share of any damages
but as <unk> <unk> law professor <unk> <unk> <unk> notes by this reasoning a defendant could be held liable in <unk> <unk> for a bad apple even if he sold all his apples in <unk>
despite the <unk> <unk> refusal to hear the case there are serious constitutional issues of due process and uncompensated takings from the defendants
the big problem however is that there no guarantee that this reasoning will be limited to <unk> or to drugs
the problem here goes well beyond twisting legal doctrine
the <unk> <unk> <unk> last year reversed direction to make it much harder to win <unk> cases because the justices saw how all the pharmaceutical litigation has chilled the introduction of new drugs
the court rejected strict liability for prescription drugs citing the huge hidden social costs
public policy favors the development and marketing of beneficial new drugs even though some risks perhaps serious ones might accompany their introduction because drugs can save lives and reduce pain and suffering the unanimous court said
the <unk> justices noted that the fear of litigation already forced the only remaining anti - morning-sickness drug <unk> off the <unk> market
this raises the key issue what to do about people who suffer serious injuries from beneficial drugs
we now know that holding drug makers liable where there no evidence that they or anyone else knew of any risks only means n the drugs wo n't be available to anyone
as liability expert <unk> <unk> tells us after the <unk> case if any drug maker introduces an anti - miscarriage drug it time n to sell that company stock short
we also know that the tort system is a lousy way n to compensate victims anyway some win the legal lottery others get much less and contingency - fee lawyers take a big cut either way
<unk> daughters and other victims of drugs would be better off if their cases were taken out of the courts
<unk> could create a compensation program n to help such victims while protecting the national interest in encouraging new drugs
but a n law that supposedly replaced lawsuits over children vaccines with a compensation fund has predictably led to even more litigation
everyone by now understands that <unk> is utterly incapable of writing legislation <unk> to help deserving people without its becoming some billion - dollar morass
we have no doubt <unk> this is one reason n judges in <unk> <unk> and justices on the <unk> <unk> are willing to trash the law in the <unk> cases
they must figure that justice has to get done by somebody but know <unk> it wo n't be done by <unk>

the n state - owned <unk> had eight million guilders of extraordinary charges in the latest quarter mainly to reflect one - time losses in connection with the disposal of some operations
the charges were offset in part by a gain from the sale of the company construction division
last year <unk> had n million guilders of extraordinary charges for the restructuring program and other transactions
the earnings growth also was fueled by the company ability to cut net financing spending by half to around n million guilders
also substantially lower dutch corporate tax rates helped the company keep its tax outlay flat relative to earnings growth the company added n
sales however were little changed at n billion guilders compared with n billion guilders

the <unk> <unk> proposal which is expected today is described by government sources and lobbyists as significantly weaker than the <unk> administration plan to cut utility emissions that lead to acid rain

although final details were n't available sources said <unk> the <unk> plan would abandon the president proposal for a cap on utilities sulfur - dioxide emissions
that proposal had been hailed by environmentalists but despised by utilities because they feared n it would limit their growth
it also would junk an innovative market - based system for trading emissions credits among polluters
in addition it is believed to offer a cost - sharing mechanism that would help subsidize the clean - up costs for the dirtiest coal - fired utilities in the country sparing their customers from exorbitant jumps in their electric bills
the administration sticking to its vow of avoiding tax increases has staunchly opposed cost - sharing
<unk> <unk> staff was expected to present its acid - rain alternative to other committee members apparently in an attempt to appease midwestern lawmakers from high - polluting states who insist on cost - sharing
it is n't clear however whether support for the proposal will be broad enough to pose a serious challenge to the <unk> <unk> acid - rain plan

meanwhile the bad bank with the junk bonds and some capital might be spun off to <unk> shareholders including <unk> <unk> who might then have a new career investors say n
it is n't clear how much a restructuring would help <unk> stockholders
but the concept is workable
you sell the good bank as an ongoing operation and use some of the proceeds to capitalize the bad bank says thrift specialist <unk> <unk> of <unk> associates in <unk> <unk>

few people think <unk> <unk> <unk> wants to run a bread - and-butter thrift which current rules would force <unk> to become
they are n't really a thrift says <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> analyst

feeding <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> pages n a highly detailed account of the <unk> scandal begins on a reassuring note
right up front in the preface co - author <unk> <unk> gives us an example of his own integrity
when offered a free trip from the <unk> <unk> home to <unk> <unk> by one of <unk> principals he tells the reader mindful of accepting anything of value from those <unk> i was writing about i declined
any question as to why an author would believe n this plaintive high - minded note of assurance is necessary is answered by reading this book about sticky fingers and sweaty scammers
bribe by bribe <unk> <unk> and his co - author <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> lead us along the path <unk> <unk> traveled from its inception as a small manufacturing company to the status of full - fledged defense contractor entrusted with the task of producing vital equipment for the <unk> and <unk>
the book revolves around <unk> <unk> the founder of the company and <unk> <unk> who became his partner soon after <unk> creation
although started in <unk> <unk> did n't really get rolling until n when <unk> <unk> discovered the federal government section n a minority business program
this is a <unk> - era <unk> <unk> creation that mandates n certain government contracts be awarded noncompetitively to minority businesses
<unk> <unk> realized that although of italian ancestry <unk> <unk> still could qualify as a minority person since he was born in <unk> <unk>
the two partners merely had to falsify the true ownership of the corporation
instead of n it became on paper only two - thirds <unk> one - third <unk> and they were in the program and off to the races
besides being a minority - owned company <unk> was located in the <unk> <unk> a blighted area made famous by <unk> <unk> in his n presidential campaign
the company plugged itself right into <unk> campaign rhetoric about rebuilding the <unk> <unk> and kept using the minority <unk> <unk> angle through the <unk> <unk>
starting with <unk> <unk> <unk> now serving a jail sentence the company began a career of bribing federal state and local public officials and those close to public officials right up to and including <unk> <unk> <unk> close friend and adviser to former <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> did n't just use old fashioned bribery
it made ample use of the modern techniques of influence peddling retaining politically connected respectable law firms investment bankers and political consultants including <unk> confidant <unk> <unk>
when necessary it sought and received assistance from organized crime
sometimes the bribed became partners in the company
<unk> management used the merit system
if you were especially helpful in a corrupt scheme you received not just cash in a bag but equity
if you were not an effective crook you found yourself out in the cold a fate that eventually befell <unk> <unk> the firm semiliterate minority person
but despite the sensational nature of the revelations and the breezy easy - to-read tabloid writing style feeding <unk> often falls short of gripping reading
none of the scams show much ingenuity auditors found crookery the first day on the job
<unk> scammers simply bribed them to shut up
the scammers themselves were garden - variety low lifes conspicuous consumers who wanted big houses mercedes cars beautiful women expensive clothes
among the lot of them not one is wrestling with good and evil or especially intelligent or even temporarily insane
the one character at least somewhat interesting was <unk> <unk> <unk> a pediatrician who changed his name to <unk> <unk> <unk> and became a master gambler and author of a book on blackjack
he enters the story toward the end just in time <unk> to get arrested
<unk> in doling out feeding <unk> tidbits the authors gloss over the root causes of <unk> namely the <unk> <unk> a federal program under whose auspices the scandal took place
they do at least come around to saying that the courts might want to end rigid affirmative action programs
programs like section n a are a little like leaving gold in the street and then expressing surprise when thieves walk by to scoop it up
numerous other scandals among them the ones at <unk> have the same characteristics as <unk>
they take place in government programs that seem tailor - made for corruption
why are programs like this not eliminated
feeding <unk> does provide a few clues
in and around all levels of government in the <unk> are groups of people who can best be described as belonging to a political insider commercial party
they know that whenever government is redistributing wealth regulating commerce or maintaining a large defense establishment there is big money n to be made in influencing brokering or selling the processes and decisions of government
they are our version of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and they have absolutely no wish to see anything change
how many government programs and policies exist because they line the pockets of political insiders
this is the real issue raised by the <unk> scandal
<unk> <unk> was chairman and chief executive officer of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> n
the finnish government and major creditors of bankrupt shipyard <unk> <unk> industries <unk> agreed in principle to form a new company to complete most of the troubled shipyard backlog of <unk> ships

the battery plant which makes rechargeable nickel cadmium and carbon zinc products will be closed over the next year or so a spokesman said n
<unk> attributed its fourth - quarter slump partly to higher costs of ingredients in the pet food business as well as competitive pressures which required higher advertising spending
for the year pet food volume was flat the company said n
its cereal division realized higher operating profit on volume increases but also spent more on promotion
the <unk> <unk> business benefited from higher margins on bread and on increased cake sales it added n

the record corn - buying binge by the <unk> <unk> is causing serious bottlenecks in the <unk> grain pipeline
the soviet purchases are so massive that exporters are struggling to find enough river barges and trains n to move the recently harvested <unk> crop to ports for loading onto soviet ships
<unk> barge rates have soared n this fall from a year earlier
railroad companies and some ports are reaping a sudden windfall of business
and some grain analysts are predicting that corn prices might gyrate this month as exporters scrounge to find enough of the crop <unk> to meet their obligations to the soviets
the <unk> <unk> bought roughly n million bushels of <unk> corn in <unk> which is the most ever sold to the <unk> <unk> in one month from the <unk>
the <unk> <unk> wants much of it delivered by <unk> which would be a strain in most years
but it is particularly difficult this autumn because of low water levels on the <unk> <unk> on which flows much of the <unk> corn that is shipped overseas
we are shipping the most corn in that short of time period to one customer on record said <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> transportation expert
it is going to be real tight
because of persistent dry weather in the northern plains the water level on the upper section of the <unk> <unk> is so low that many river operators are already trimming the number of barges n their tows push at one time
in a few weeks many barges probably wo n't be able to operate fully loaded south of <unk> <unk> because the <unk> <unk> <unk> of engineers is beginning to reduce the flow of the <unk> <unk> which feeds into the <unk> <unk>
the <unk> <unk> is cutting the flow of the <unk> <unk> about two weeks earlier than normal because of low water levels in the reservoirs that feed it
barge rates on the <unk> <unk> sank yesterday on speculation that widespread rain this week in the <unk> might temporarily alleviate the situation
but the <unk> <unk> of engineers expects the river level to continue falling this month
at <unk> <unk> the water level of the <unk> <unk> is already n feet below normal and it could drop an additional n feet when the flow of the <unk> <unk> is slowed an <unk> <unk> spokesman said n
similar levels hamstrung barge shipments last year in the wake of the worst drought in <unk> years
so far the grain industry budding logistical problems have n't been a major factor in the trading of corn contracts at the <unk> <unk> of <unk>
many grain processors and exporters use the price of the corn futures contracts traded there to calculate the price n they offer to buy corn from farmers
at the <unk> of <unk> yesterday the price of the corn contract for <unk> delivery slipped n cents a bushel to settle at <unk> a bushel
corn prices have been sluggish this fall despite the huge soviet orders because the harvest has allowed farmers to rebuild the stockpiles depleted by the <unk> drought
with the harvest winding down however some analysts are speculating that prices might jump in some regions as <unk> exporters try to gather the corn n they are obligated to deliver
farmers are in the best position of many years n to push up corn prices
because the drought reduced <unk> stockpiles they have more than enough storage space for their new crop and that permits them to wait for prices to rise
in parts of <unk> for example some grain elevators are offering farmers n a bushel for corn
many farmers probably would n't sell until prices rose at least n cents a bushel said <unk> <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
it is n't clear however who would win a waiting game
although <unk> corn stockpiles shrank by roughly half in the wake of the drought the <unk> <unk> projects that nearly one - fifth of the harvest will still be in storage before the <unk> corn harvest begins
some analysts are worried that reports of the grain industry problems might spark investors to begin buying corn futures contracts only to see little appreciation
the public is buying the market when in reality there is plenty of grain n to be shipped said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> research director
although much of this country export corn goes to <unk> <unk> by barge it is possible for exporters to sidestep the <unk> <unk> by shipping a larger - than-normal amount of corn by train to the port
ports in the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> can also relieve pressure on <unk> <unk>
one railroad for example is already increasing its grain hauling service from <unk> to <unk>
and it is n't clear that the <unk> <unk> will stay on its record buying pace
the soviet orders were compressed into the month of <unk> because of delays
the <unk> <unk> usually begins buying <unk> crops earlier in the fall
but its purchases apparently were delayed by a reorganization of its agricultural bureaucracy as well as budget problems

precious metals gold in particular currently are being influenced more by stock market gyrations than the dollar as traders seek greater investment stability according to <unk> <unk> vice president of research at <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
the recent rally in precious metals was a result of uncertainty and volatility in equities he said
yesterday the stock market rose strongly creating a more defensive attitude among precious metals traders he said n
silver and platinum which have more of an industrial nature than gold were even weaker he said n
silver is also under pressure of extremely high inventories in warehouses of the <unk> <unk> he said n
yesterday these stocks rose by <unk> ounces to a record of <unk> ounces according to an exchange spokesman
copper futures prices partially recovered <unk> declines because chilean miners voted to strike
the <unk> contract rose n cents a pound to n
in <unk> workers at two copper mines <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> which belong to the <unk> - owned <unk> <unk> yesterday voted to begin a full strike tomorrow an analyst said <unk>
reasons for the walkout the analyst said n included a number of procedural issues such as a right to strike
the analyst noted that also inherent in all metal markets was a sympathetic reaction to stocks
in the case of copper he said n the upbeat mood of stocks was reflected in demand for futures contracts because a stronger economy means greater buying interest for the metal
also contributing to the firmness in copper the analyst noted <unk> was a report by <unk> purchasing agents which precedes the full purchasing agents report that is due out today and gives an indication of what the full report might hold
the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> index rose to n after three previous months of readings below n
the <unk> index was <unk>
a reading below n generally indicates a slowing in the industrial sector of the economy while a reading above n points to expansion

<unk> <unk> posted a n drop in third - quarter profit as improved oil results failed to offset weakness in steel and natural gas operations
the nation largest steelmaker earned n million or n cents a share compared with the year - earlier <unk> million or n cents a share
the recent quarter includes pretax gains of n million from asset sales while like gains in the year - earlier quarter totaled n million
in the n period <unk> also had a n million after - tax gain from a tax dispute settlement
sales rose <unk> to n billion from n billion
the earnings drop appears particularly steep in comparison with last year unusually strong third quarter when the company was riding an industrywide boom in demand and pricing
however third - quarter operating profit fell <unk> as <unk> sold sizable chunks of its diversified and steel segments eliminating income from those operations
among segments that continue to operate though the company steel division continued to suffer from soft demand for its tubular goods serving the oil industry and other markets
<unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk> said that a downturn in the appliance industry coupled with sluggish automotive sales hurt <unk> results
moreover <unk> exports more than other steelmakers and the overseas market has been under more severe pricing pressure
the company attributed lower sales and earnings for the steel segment to the loss of results from the <unk> <unk> plant which now is a n joint venture with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
in the steel division operating profit dropped <unk> to n million
profit per ton of steel shipped dropped to about <unk> a ton from <unk> a ton last year and <unk> a ton in the second quarter analysts said n
still <unk> fared better than other major steelmakers earning more per ton of steel shipped than either <unk> <unk> <unk> which posted a n drop in net income or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> whose profit plummeted n
in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> composite trading yesterday <unk> shares closed up n at <unk> as the reported earnings exceeded projections by some analysts who had n't expected as great a volume of asset sales
the rise in the stock price may also reflect the fact that <unk> steel segment fared better than some other steelmakers
<unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said n <unk> may have received orders lost by competitors who were involved in labor contracts earlier this year
he said <unk> <unk> also appeared to sell a richer mix of steel products such as the more profitable pipe and galvanized coated sheet than lower - priced structural goods
the energy segment with a <unk> rise in operating profit is clearly the company strongest
higher crude oil prices helped boost operating profit for the <unk> <unk> <unk> unit to n million from n million
the <unk> <unk> <unk> division continues to operate in the red although losses narrowed to n million from n million
<unk> announced in <unk> that it was soliciting bids to sell <unk> oil and gas reserves

two leading constitutional - law experts said <unk> <unk> <unk> does n't have the legal authority to exercise a line - item veto
professors <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> any effort by <unk> <unk> <unk> to claim authority for a line - item veto would contradict the text of the <unk> and the intent of its authors as well as the views of previous presidents
a line - item veto is a procedure that would allow a president to veto part of a big congressional spending bill without having to scuttle the entire measure
<unk> <unk> has said n he would like to be able to use this procedure
a <unk> <unk> spokesman said last week that the president is considering declaring that the <unk> implicitly gives him the authority for a line - item veto to provoke a test case
but the two legal experts responding to an inquiry by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> wrote in a joint letter that the president lacks the constitutional authority to exercise a line - item veto
the two professors represent different ends of the political spectrum <unk> <unk> is a conservative and <unk> <unk> is a liberal
the two professors said <unk> the <unk> authorizes the president to veto entire bills not partial measures
moreover they said n the first appropriations bill passed n years ago covered many different items and there was no discussion of a line - item veto
they also said that more than a dozen presidents have called for line - item veto authority since the <unk> <unk> and all have shared the view that such lawmaking power is beyond the reach of the president

investors are appealing to the securities and <unk> <unk> not to limit their access to information about stock purchases and sales by corporate insiders
a <unk> proposal to ease reporting requirements for some company executives would undermine the usefulness of information on insider trades as a stock - picking tool individual investors and professional money managers contend n
they make the argument in letters to the agency about rule changes proposed this past summer that among other things would exempt many middle - management executives from reporting trades in their own companies shares
the proposed changes also would allow executives to report exercises of options later and less often
many of the letters maintain that investor confidence has been so shaken by the <unk> stock market crash and the markets already so stacked against the little guy that any decrease in information on insider - trading patterns might prompt individuals to get out of stocks altogether
the <unk> has historically paid obeisance to the ideal of a level playing field wrote <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> in one of the <unk> letters n the agency has received since the changes were proposed <unk> n
apparently the commission did not really believe in this ideal
currently the rules force executives directors and other corporate insiders to report purchases and sales of their companies shares within about a month after the transaction
but about n of the insiders according to <unk> figures file their reports late
the changes were proposed in an effort to streamline federal bureaucracy and boost compliance by the executives who are really calling the shots said <unk> <unk> <unk> special counsel at the <unk> office of disclosure policy which proposed the changes
investors money managers and corporate officials had until today to comment on the proposals and the issue has produced more mail than almost any other issue in memory <unk> <unk> said <unk>
the <unk> will probably vote on the proposal early next year he said n
not all those who wrote oppose the changes
the <unk> on <unk> <unk> of securities for the <unk> <unk> <unk> argues for example in its lengthy letter to the <unk> that the proposed changes would substantially improve the law by conforming it more closely to contemporary business realities
what the investors who oppose the proposed changes object to most is the effect n they say n the proposal would have on their ability to spot telltale clusters of trading activity buying or selling by more than one officer or director within a short period of time
according to some estimates the rule changes would cut insider filings by more than a third
the <unk> <unk> <unk> vehemently disputed those estimates
the rules will eliminate filings policy - making divisions such as sales marketing finance and research and development <unk> <unk> said <unk>
the proposed rules also would be tougher on the insiders still required to file reports he said n
companies would be compelled to publish in annual proxy statements the names of insiders who fail to file reports on time
considered as a whole <unk> <unk> said the filings required under the proposed rules will be at least as effective if not more so for investors following transactions
but <unk> <unk> president of <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> company that packages and sells the insider - trading data said n the proposal is worded so vaguely that key officials may fail to file the reports
many investors wrote asking the <unk> to require insiders to report their purchases and sales immediately not a month later
but <unk> <unk> said that while the <unk> regulates who files the law tells them when to do so
investors who want to change the required timing should write their representatives in <unk> he added n
the <unk> would likely be amenable to legislation that required insiders to file transactions on a more timely basis he said n

<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> years old a senior vice president at this printing concern was elected president of its technology group a new position
solo woodwind players have to be creative if they want to work a lot because their repertoire and audience appeal are limited
the oboist <unk> <unk> has taken a hard line about the problem he commissions and splendidly interprets fearsome contemporary scores and does some conducting so he does n't have to play the same <unk> and <unk> concertos over and over again
<unk> <unk> has taken a gentler more audience - friendly approach
years ago he collaborated with the new music gurus <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the very countercultural chamber group <unk> which won audiences over to dreaded contemporary scores like <unk> <unk> for the end of time
today the pixie - like clarinetist has mostly dropped the missionary work though a touch of the old <unk> still survives and now goes on the road with piano bass a slide show and a repertoire that ranges from light classical to light jazz to light pop with a few notable exceptions
just the thing for the <unk> - <unk> set the yuppie audience that has embraced <unk> <unk> as its very own easy listening
but you ca n't dismiss <unk> <unk> music or his motives as merely commercial and lightweight
he believes in what he plays and he plays superbly
his recent appearance at the <unk> <unk> dubbed a musical <unk> was a case in point
it felt more like a party or a highly polished jam session with a few friends than a classical concert
clad in his trademark black velvet suit the soft - spoken clarinetist announced that his new album <unk> voices had just been released that his family was in the front row and that it was his mother birthday so he was going to play her favorite tune from the record
he launched into <unk> - <unk> the <unk> from <unk> of the animals a favorite encore piece for cellists with lovely glossy tone and no bite
then as if to show that he could play fast as well he offered the second movement from <unk> - <unk> <unk> for <unk> a whimsical puckish tidbit that reflected the flip side of the <unk> personality
and so it went through the first half an ingeniously chosen potpourri of pieces none longer than five minutes none that would disturb or challenge a listener
<unk> <unk> introduced his colleagues <unk> <unk> <unk> and an old buddy from <unk> and jazz bassist <unk> <unk>
an improvisational section was built around pieces by <unk> <unk> beginning with <unk> rain a lilting laid - back lead in to the <unk> <unk> which gave <unk> <unk> the opportunity to wail in a high register and show off his fleet fingers
<unk> <unk> followed
<unk> <unk> tied the composer in by proclaiming him the great improviser of the <unk> century and then built on the image by joining with <unk> <unk> in some <unk> two - part inventions cleverly arranged for clarinet and bassoon by <unk> <unk>
keeping the mood light the two then chanted and chortled their way through some murderous polyrhythms devised by <unk> <unk> as an alternative to <unk> dry theory - teaching techniques and then with <unk> <unk> soared and improvised on the composer tight <unk> <unk>
the end of the first half however brought what the standing - room-only crowd seemed to be waiting for the pop singer <unk> <unk> who appears on <unk> voices
glamorous and pure - voiced as ever <unk> <unk> sang <unk> <unk> for <unk> about an encounter with a street - corner clarinetist to which <unk> <unk> contributed a clarinet obligatto and <unk> <unk> lush setting of a gaelic blessing <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> also featured a slide show of lovely but predictable images of clouds beaches deserts sunsets etc
it was all too mellow n to be believed but they probably would have gotten away with it had they not felt compelled to add <unk> <unk> signature tune <unk> <unk> and ask for audience participation
that went over the permissible line for warm and fuzzy feelings
was this why some of the audience departed before or during the second half
or was it because <unk> <unk> had gone
either way it was a pity because <unk> <unk> offered the most substantial music of the evening just after intermission <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> counterpoint one of a series of <unk> works that juxtapose a live performer with recorded tracks of his or her own playing
<unk> <unk> new different trains for string quartet uses the technique magisterially
<unk> <unk> must have worried that his audience might not be able to take it he warned us in advance that <unk> <unk> <unk> lasts <unk> <unk> minutes
he also unfortunately illustrated this intricate jazzy tapestry with <unk> <unk> images this time of geometric or repeating objects in a kitschy mirroring of the musical structure that was thoroughly distracting from <unk> <unk> piece and <unk> <unk> elegant execution of it
the rest of the concert was more straight jazz and mellow sounds written by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> with pictures for the <unk> pieces
it was enjoyable to hear accomplished jazz without having to sit in a smoke - filled club but like the first half much of it was easy <unk> to take and ultimately forgettable
is this the future of chamber music
managers and presenters insist that chamber music concerts are a hard sell but can audiences really enjoy them only if the music is purged of threatening elements served up in bite - sized morsels and accompanied by visuals
what next
<unk> n to illustrate <unk> quartets
it was not an unpleasant evening certainly thanks to the high level of performance the compositional talents of <unk> <unk> and the obvious sincerity with which <unk> <unk> chooses his selections
but it was neither deep nor lasting light entertainment that was no substitute for an evening of <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a free - lance writer based in <unk> <unk>
one of <unk> <unk> attributes as <unk> was that he rarely gave his blessing to the claptrap that passes for consensus in various international institutions
in fact he liberated the <unk> from one of the world most corrupt organizations <unk>
this is the <unk> group that managed to traduce its own charter of promoting education science and culture
ever since the remaining members have been desperate for the <unk> <unk> to rejoin this dreadful group
now <unk> apologists are lobbying <unk> <unk> to renege on <unk> <unk> decision to depart
but we can think of many reasons n to stay out for the foreseeable future and well beyond
the <unk> along with <unk> and <unk> left the agency when its anti - western ideology financial corruption and top leadership got out of hand
the personal antics of agency <unk> <unk> - <unk> <unk> drew much attention such as when several of his top aides were uncovered as <unk> plants and ejected from <unk> and when a mysterious office fire was set just before <unk> sent accountants <unk> to trace <unk> funds
<unk> <unk> was an extreme case but even his replacement the more personally genial spanish biochemist <unk> <unk> has had little success at achieving reforms
several ridiculous projects continue including the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which means redistributionism from the <unk> <unk> to pay for everyone else statism
the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> would give government officials rights against the press journalists would be obliged to kowtow to their government which would have licensing and censorship powers and indeed duties to block printing of wrong ideas
<unk> somehow converted the founding <unk> ideals of individual rights and liberty into peoples rights
million - dollar conferences were held n to chew on subjects such as ethical responsibilities of scientists in support of disarmament and the impact of the activities of transnational corporations
the agency was so totally subverted from the high principles of its founding that even the soviets now wonder about an agency that seemed so congenial to them
glasnost may be partly responsible but soviet <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> last year admitted the exaggerated ideological approach undermined tolerance intrinsic to <unk>
<unk> is now holding its biennial meetings in <unk> <unk> to devise its next projects
<unk> <unk> hope that references to press freedom would survive unamended seems doomed to failure the current phrasing is educating the public and media to avoid manipulation
he has n't been able to replace the <unk> cabal
soviets remain in charge of education programs a former head of an african military tribunal for executions is in charge of culture and a hard - line polish communist in exile directs the human - rights and peace division
of the agency n staff members <unk> are in the field working on actual projects such as literacy and oceanographic research
the position of the <unk> <unk> which once contributed n of the budget is that nothing has changed
<unk> <unk> the assistant secretary of state for international organizations told <unk> that the continuing statist restrictive nondemocratic programs make rejoining any time soon extremely unlikely
this has n't much bothered the <unk> delegates who last week could n't even agree to raise funds by selling off a fancy n french chateau n the agency somehow owns
other countries including <unk> <unk> may have a hard time justifying continued membership
we see an even stronger argument against <unk> than its unsurprising failure to reform
this is that the <unk> <unk> spanning <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> shows the power of ideas unencumbered by international civil servants or government functionaries
free markets free minds and free elections have an appeal that seems to get muddled only when delivered through <unk> organizations which of course are made up largely of governments that fear these principles at home
the babelists of the <unk> nations are experts at obfuscation
this can have its purposes at times but there no reason n to cloud the importance and allure of western concepts of freedom and justice
we can see plenty of reasons <unk> to stay out and none n to rejoin <unk>
researchers at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> said n they have developed a genetic engineering technique for creating hybrid plants for a number of key crops
the researchers said n they have isolated a plant gene that prevents the production of pollen
the gene thus can prevent a plant from fertilizing itself
such so - called male - sterile plants can then be fertilized by pollen from another strain of the plant thereby producing hybrid seed
the new generation of plants will possess the flourishing high - production trait known as hybrid vigor similar to that now seen in hybrid corn
the development could have a dramatic effect on farm production especially cotton said <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> subsidiary that is one of the largest cotton seed producers in the <unk>
on a commercial scale the sterilization of the pollen - producing male part has only been achieved in corn and sorghum feed grains
that because the male part the tassel and the female the ear are some distance apart on the corn plant
in a labor - intensive process the seed companies cut off the tassels of each plant making it male sterile
they sow a row of male - fertile plants nearby which then pollinate the male - sterile plants
the first hybrid corn seeds produced using this mechanical approach were introduced in the n and they yielded as much as n more corn than naturally pollinated plants
the vast majority of the <unk> corn crop now is grown from hybrid seeds produced by seed companies
a similar technique is almost impossible n to apply to other crops such as cotton soybeans and rice
the male part the anthers of the plant and the female the pistils of the same plant are within a fraction of an inch or even attached to each other
the anthers in these plants are difficult n to clip off
in <unk> a great number of workers are engaged in pulling out the male organs of rice plants using tweezers and one - third of rice produced in that country is grown from hybrid seeds
at <unk> <unk> systems researchers have isolated a pollen - inhibiting gene that can be inserted in a plant to confer male sterility
<unk> <unk> research director said <unk> this gene was successfully introduced in oil - producing rapeseed plants a major crop in <unk> and <unk> using as a carrier a promoter gene developed by <unk> <unk> at the <unk> of <unk> in <unk> <unk>
the sterilizing gene is expressed just before the pollen is about to develop and it deactivates the anthers of every flower in the plant
<unk> <unk> said n this genetic manipulation does n't hurt the growth of that plant
the researchers also pulled off a second genetic engineering trick in order to get male - sterile plants in large enough numbers to produce a commercial hybrid seed crop
they attached a second gene for herbicide resistance to the pollen - inhibiting gene
both genes are then inserted into a few greenhouse plants which are then pollinated and allowed to mature and produce seed
the laws of heredity dictate that half of the plants springing from these greenhouse - produced seeds will be male sterile and herbicide resistant and half will be male fertile and herbicide susceptible
the application of herbicide would kill off the male - fertile plants leaving a large field of male - sterile plants that can be cross - pollinated to produce hybrid seed
<unk> <unk> said <unk> the hybrid rapeseeds created with this genetic engineering yield n to n more output than the commercial strains used currently
this technique is applicable to a wide variety of crops he said and added that some modifications may be necessary to accommodate the peculiarities of each type of crop
he said n the company is experimenting with the technique on alfalfa and plans to include cotton and corn among other crops
he said that even though virtually all corn seeds currently planted are hybrids the genetic approach will obviate the need for mechanical emasculation of anthers which costs <unk> seed producers about n million annually
in recent years demand for hybrid seeds has spurred research at a number of chemical and biotechnology companies including <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
one technique developed by some of these companies involves a chemical spray supposed to kill only a plant pollen
but there have been problems with chemical sprays damaging plants female reproductive organs and concern for the toxicity of such chemical sprays to humans animals and beneficial insects
however <unk> <unk> <unk> director of plant sciences said n the company chemical spray overcomes these problems and is gentle on the female organ
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is developing a spray containing a gene that spreads from cell to cell and interferes with the genes that are responsible for producing pollen
this gene called gametocide is carried into the plant by a virus that remains active for a few days
<unk> <unk> president of <unk> called <unk> <unk> approach interesting and novel and complementary rather than competitive
there is a large market out there hungry for hybrid seeds he said
<unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> the seed producer in <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> success in creating genetically engineered male steriles does n't automatically mean <unk> it would be simple to create hybrids in all crops
that because pollination while easy in corn because the carrier is wind is more complex and involves insects as carriers in crops such as cotton
it one thing to say n you can sterilize and another to then successfully pollinate the plant he said
nevertheless he said n he is negotiating with <unk> <unk> to acquire the technology n to try breeding hybrid cotton
a bitter conflict with global implications has erupted between <unk> securities <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> two of the world most powerful financial companies
the clash is a sign of a new toughness and divisiveness in <unk> once - cozy financial circles
not only are <unk> financial institutions putting their enormous clout to work increasingly they squaring off against one another in unprecedented public fashion
already the consequences are being felt by other players in the financial markets even governments
what triggered the latest clash was a skirmish over the timing of a <unk> <unk> government bond issue
<unk> was attempting to organize the n billion - yen n million borrowing in <unk> at a time when many japanese banks led by <unk> <unk> of <unk> were pressuring the <unk> government to help them recover loans made to a defunct investment bank that had been owned by <unk> <unk> civil - service pension fund
unwilling to put up new money for <unk> <unk> until those debts are repaid most banks refused even to play administrative roles in the new financing forcing an embarrassed <unk> to postpone it this week
the dispute shows clearly the global power of <unk> financial titans
aside from <unk> injured pride the biggest victim so far has been the <unk> <unk> government
barred by its budget law from making any new domestic bond issues <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> had been casting abroad to raise the <unk> billion <unk> <unk> dollars <unk> <unk> billion to <unk> $ n billion n it needs to come up with by the end of its fiscal year next <unk> <unk>
with <unk> cash - flush banks aligned against it though raising money may be difficult
not only can they block <unk> from raising money in <unk> bankers here say n but as the largest underwriters in the eurobond market they might be able to scuttle borrowings there too
<unk> <unk> finance minister <unk> <unk> lashed out at such suggestions
he told reporters in <unk> <unk> that the government had n't guaranteed the loans to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> an investment bank n by the <unk> <unk> <unk> and would n't bail it out
it may very well be what the japanese banks want he told <unk> <unk> <unk>
i think n it would be irresponsible and i am not about to be blackmailed by japanese banks or any other international interests
no less significant than the japanese banks attempt to cut off funds to pressure a foreign government are the implications of a confrontation between <unk> securities and banking industries
anxiety is rising over recent government proposals to eventually lower the strict barriers that now separate and protect the two industries from each other
both sides are jealously guarding their turf and relations have been at a flashpoint for months
the banks badly want to break into all aspects of the securities business
meanwhile the securities companies most of them smaller than the banks are seeking access only to limited kinds of banking that would n't open them to the full brunt of competition from the banks
<unk> the world biggest securities company largely by virtue of its protected home field and <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> most innovative and aggressive bank in capital markets abroad captain the opposing sides
and their suspicions of each other run deep
in the past year both have tried to stretch the limits of their businesses
<unk> started a credit - card venture with <unk> <unk> <unk> that allowed cardholders to use their <unk> securities accounts like a bank account attracting the wrath of banks
and <unk> <unk> of <unk> started up a <unk> securities subsidiary that sells japanese stocks to non - japanese institutions overseas a move that stirred the anger of the stock brokerage firms
the <unk> <unk> bond issue simply has brought the two institutions face - to-face
<unk> <unk> reported third - quarter earnings which were mistakenly shown in the <unk> earnings surprises table in yesterday edition to be lower than the average of analysts estimates

but as they hurl fireballs that smolder rather than burn and relive old duels in the sun it clear that most are there to make their fans cheer again or recapture the camaraderie of seasons past or prove to themselves and their colleagues that they still have it or something close to it

<unk> own defenses against a hostile bid are weakened analysts add <unk> because fewer than n of its shares are owned by employees and management
<unk> officials in the <unk> declined to comment on the british government action or on any plans to call a special <unk> shareholders meeting
but <unk> officials said n they too were surprised by the move which left them to consider all our options and explore matters further

this week was uneventful for the <unk> market said <unk> <unk> chairman of <unk>
the major banks have n't even reacted to sharp rises in the three - month <unk> bill rates in the past two weeks
banks that adjusted payouts on cds in the most recent week made only fractional moves he said n
the cd trend runs counter to the direction of short - term interest rates at the <unk> bill auction <unk>
the average six - month bill was sold with a yield of <unk> up from <unk>
the average three - month issue rose to <unk> from <unk>
typically banks offer cd yields higher than those on <unk> bills which are considered the safest short - term investments banks need a competitive edge to sell their products

i had to reach back to <unk> <unk> when the monsieur avec clipboard leaned over my shoulder during the coffee phase of dinner and asked whether i wanted to ride in a montgolfiere
i was a last - minute read interloping attendee at a french journalism convention and so far the festivities had been taken up entirely by eating drinking smoking sleeping and drinking
the man with the clipboard represented a halfhearted attempt to introduce a bit of les sportif into our itinerary
but as the french embody a <unk> - like state of blase when it comes to athletics try finding a nautilus machine in <unk> my fellow conventioners were having none of it
the diners at my table simply lit more gauloises and scoffed at the suggestion of interrupting a perfectly good <unk> morning to go golfing or even montgolfing ballooning to you the brothers <unk> <unk> of course were the world first hot - air balloonists
back in the <unk> this kind of chi - chi airborne activity wins heartwarmingly covetous responses
as in you went ballooning
in <unk>
americans it seems n have followed <unk> <unk> hot - air lead and taken to ballooning in a heady way
during the past <unk> years the number of balloonists those who have passed a <unk> <unk> <unk> lighter - than-air test have swelled from a couple hundred to several thousand with some estimates running as high as n
some n balloon shows are held annually in the <unk> including the world largest convocation of ersatz <unk> <unk> the nine - day <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that attracts some n enthusiasts and more than <unk> balloons some of which are fetchingly shaped to resemble <unk> <unk> <unk> or a n condom
the condom balloon was denied official entry status this year
but in <unk> a gray <unk> river town adjacent to <unk> <unk> mountain region none of these <unk> - come-lately enthusiasms for things aloft was evident
ballooning at the de rigueur hour of <unk> a.m. held all the attraction for most people of sunrise root - canal work
feeling the naggings of a culture imperative i promptly signed up
the first thing n anybody will tell you about ballooning is that it requires zip in the way of athletic prowess or even a measure of derring - do
so long as you do n't look down
they will also tell you that even if you hate heights you can still balloon
i still say do n't look down
at least not when you are ascending
what they wo n't tell you is not to go aloft in anything n you do n't want to get wet
i not referring to the traditional champagne drenching during the back - on-terra-firma toast
i talking about landing in a canal
in a porous wicker basket
with a pilot who speaks no <unk>
to wit my maiden voyage and novitiates are referred to as virgins began at dawn on a dew - sodden fairway and ended at noon in a soggy field
balloon flights almost always occur at dawn or dusk when the winds are lightest
in between came lots of coffee drinking while watching the balloons inflate and lots of standing around deciding who would fly in what balloon and in what order the baskets hold no more than four passengers
when it was n't my turn in the balloon i followed its progress from the chase car listening to the driver holler into a walkie - talkie
after long stretches of this attendant ground activity came <unk> or so lovely minutes of drifting above the vosges watching the silver mists rise off the river and the french cows amble about the fields
it hard not to feel that <unk> in his heaven with this kind of bird's - eye view of the world even if your pilote in silly plaid beret kept pointing out how belle it all was
eventually little french farmers and their little french farmwives came out of their stone houses and put their hands above their tiny eyes and squinted at us
no wonder
we were coming down straight into their canal
see the other rule of thumb about ballooning is that you ca n't steer
and neither can your pilot
you can go only up or down by heating the balloon air with a propane burner which does make the top of your head feel hot and ride the air currents
which makes the chase car necessary
most balloonists seldom go higher than n feet and most average a leisurely n miles an hour
when the balloon is cruising along at a steady altitude there is little sense of motion
only when one is ascending or in our case descending a tad trop rapidement does one feel well airborne in a picnic basket
what he doing hissed my companion who was the only other <unk> - speaking member of the convention and whose knuckles were white
attention yelled our pilot as our basket plunged into the canal
you bet attention i yelled back leaping atop the propane tanks i wearing alligator loafers
our pilot simply laughed fired up the burner and with another blast of flame lifted us oh a good n above the water level
we scuttled along for a few feet before he plunged us into the drink again
eventually we came to rest in a soggy patch of field where we had the exquisite pleasure of scrambling out of the basket into the mud while the french half of our ballooning tag team scrambled in
i looked at my watch
barely half - an-hour aloft
back in the chase car we drove around some more got stuck in a ditch enlisted the aid of a local farmer n to get out the trailer hitch and pull us out of the ditch
we finally rendezvoused with our balloon which had come to rest on a dirt road amid a clutch of epinalers who watched us disassemble our craft another half - an-hour of non - flight activity that included the precision routine of yanking the balloon to the ground punching all the air out of it rolling it up and cramming it and the basket into the trailer
it was the most exercise n we had all morning and it was followed by our driving immediately to the nearest watering hole
this meant returning to the golf course where we watched a few french duffers maul the first tee while we sat under <unk> umbrellas me nursing an espresso and my ego
a whole morning of ballooning and i had been off the ground barely n minutes
still i figured n the event envy - quotient back in the <unk> was near peerless
as for the ride back to camp our pilot and all the other <unk> - speaking passengers clambered into the chase car
my american companion and i were left to ride alfresco in the wicker basket
as we streaked by a blase gendarme i could n't resist rearing up on my soggy loafers and saluting
<unk> <unk> <unk> is a free - lance writer
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> defended the <unk> efforts this fall to drive down the value of the dollar saying n it helped minimize damage from the <unk> drop in the stock market <unk> n
testifying before a <unk> subcommittee <unk> <unk> said that if the <unk> had n't intervened in foreign - exchange markets in <unk> and early <unk> to reduce the dollar value the plunge in the stock market might have provoked a steep fall in the currency that might have unhinged financial markets
<unk> <unk> responding to critics of intervention also said n intervention is highly visible is taken seriously by financial markets and works better than was recognized some time ago
differences between the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> on the usefulness of intervention n to help restrain the dollar resurfaced at the hearing
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who had dissented from the <unk> policy told lawmakers i became convinced about what looked to me like an attempt to push the dollar down against the fundamentals in the market
intervention he added n is useful only to smooth disorderly markets not to fundamentally influence the dollar value
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> refused to testify jointly with <unk> <unk> and instead asked to appear after the <unk> official had completed his testimony
a <unk> spokesman denied <unk> <unk> statement
<unk> <unk> said <unk> reports of tension between the <unk> and <unk> have been exaggerated insisting that they involved nuances
<unk> <unk> also said that in the scheme of things these things are minor
on other matters <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> is contributing to imbalances in the world economy because of its success as an exporter
the solution is stronger domestic growth in <unk> he said
but because the growth of the german economy has been stronger than expected <unk> <unk> said <unk> it difficult for the <unk> to argue that <unk> ought to adopt more stimulative monetary and fiscal policies
<unk> trade surplus is largely with other european countries rather than with the <unk> <unk> <unk> acknowledged <unk>
but nonetheless <unk> companies might be more successful in european markets if not for the german export push he said n
five officials of this investment banking firm were elected directors <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> managing director in the mergers and acquisitions department <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a managing director who directs the principal activities group which provides funding for leveraged acquisitions <unk> <unk> <unk> a general partner who heads the correspondent clearing services <unk> <unk> <unk> a general partner who is treasurer and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a general partner who is also senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer
the board increased by one to n members

some <unk> allies are complaining that <unk> <unk> is pushing conventional - arms talks too quickly creating a risk that negotiators will make errors that could affect the security of <unk> <unk> for years
concerns about the pace of the <unk> talks which are aimed at the destruction of some n weapons as well as major reductions and realignments of troops in central <unk> also are being registered at the <unk>
<unk> <unk> has called for an agreement by next <unk> at the latest
but some american defense officials believe <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> should take more time to examine the long - term implications of the options being considered
for one thing <unk> officials who asked not to be identified worry that the <unk> will have a much tougher time persuading europeans to keep some short - range nuclear weapons on their soil once soviet armored forces are thinned out
at the same time they contend that a reduction of <unk> forces under a treaty will increase the possibility of a conventional soviet attack unless the <unk> retains a residual force of nuclear weapons in <unk>
allies concerned about the deadline include the british <unk> and smaller <unk> allies some of whom do n't have adequate staffs n to provide quick answers to the questions being raised by what generally are considered the most complex arms - control talks ever attempted
so far no ally has complained openly preserving the impression that <unk> is in line with the <unk> position that a quick agreement bringing soviet conventional forces down to parity with <unk> is the west top bargaining priority
but even though <unk> negotiators have only n months left under the <unk> timetable they are still wrestling over such seemingly fundamental questions as what is a tank
five of the six categories of weapons under negotiation have n't even been defined
tanks currently are defined as armored vehicles weighing <unk> tons or more that carry large guns
the soviets complicated the issue by offering to include light tanks which are as light as <unk> tons
<unk> a. <unk> the chief soviet negotiator in the conventional - arms talks argued that this would mean n the soviets would have to destroy some n tanks while the <unk> would lose none because it has no light tanks in <unk>
but the issue is stickier than it seems
<unk> <unk> and <unk> all have light tanks n they would like to keep out of the talks
and some <unk> <unk> analysts worry that the proposed soviet redefinition is aimed at blocking the <unk> from developing lighter more transportable high - technology tanks
defining combat aircraft is even tougher
the soviets insisted that aircraft be brought into the talks then argued for exempting some <unk> russian planes because they are solely defensive
<unk> has n't budged from its insistence that any gun - carrying plane has offensive capability
the dispute over that issue according to one <unk> official is a potential treaty stopper and only <unk> <unk> and <unk> leader <unk> <unk> may be able to resolve it
accounting problems raise more knotty issues
<unk> and <unk> for example are suspected of overstating their arsenals in hopes that they can emerge from the arms - reduction treaty with large remaining forces n to deter each other
other nations are n't sure how many weapons they have in their own arsenals
it just going to be sloppy both on our side and theirs the <unk> <unk> says one <unk> analyst
so far neither the <unk> administration nor arms - control experts in <unk> seem moved by arguments that these problems may take more time n to thrash out than <unk> <unk> has allowed
they argue that the bigger danger would be that the <unk> would delay action so long that the soviets might back away from the current conciliatory attitude
so what if you miss n tanks somewhere asks <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a member of the <unk> group that visited the talks in <unk>
the bottom line is that if we can get that <unk> <unk> superiority brought down to parity we ought to keep pressing ahead as quickly as possible
i worry more about things becoming so unraveled on the other side that they might become unable to negotiate
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> announced a leasing contract with charter carrier <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a transaction involving six <unk> <unk> n
the value of the jets including spares is in excess of n million
two of the n are new aircraft <unk> to be delivered to <unk> <unk> <unk> the main subsidiary of <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> and <unk> n
four of the planes were purchased by <unk> <unk> from <unk> airlines in a previously announced transaction

the figure excludes a record number employed by extraordinary government work programs the <unk> <unk> announced <unk> <unk>
including those in the state programs there were n norwegians or about <unk> of the work force without permanent employment in <unk> up from <unk> n
the number of people registered as jobless at the end of <unk> declined by <unk> from <unk> to n
those employed in state - funded special programs increased by <unk> to <unk> in the same period the <unk> said <unk>
in <unk> n there were <unk> fewer employed by government programs
<unk> - <unk> <unk> aiming to boost soft - drink volume in <unk> said n it is discussing a joint venture with <unk> <unk> <unk> its bottling franchisee in that country
the venture would be the latest in <unk> rapid expansion of overseas investment
so far this year it has put nearly n million into bottling operations in <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
the move also reflects <unk> eagerness to have a hand in developing the soft - drink markets in <unk> <unk> countries
aside from <unk> the <unk> division is where <unk> will be focusing much of its attention for years <unk> to come
that because when <unk> looks to the <unk> area it sees an economic and demographic gold mine
in countries such as <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> economies are growing resulting in a rise in disposable income that consumers can use for soft drinks
and unlike <unk> and the <unk> where populations are aging the <unk> <unk> countries have growing proportions of youths the heaviest consumers of <unk> - <unk> and other sodas
a <unk> - <unk> spokesman said n it is too early to say how the joint venture would be structured or how much the company would invest in the transaction
in the past however <unk> has typically taken a minority stake in such ventures
by acquiring stakes in bottling companies in the <unk> and overseas <unk> has been able to improve bottlers efficiency and production and in some cases marketing
<unk> has tended to increase its control when results were sluggish in a given country
that does n't appear to be the case in <unk> a country of about three million people with a relatively high soft - drink consumption rate a key indicator of <unk> success in a market
in <unk> per - capita consumption is about one - third that of the <unk>
and combining <unk> <unk> own soft drinks with <unk> - <unk> gives the <unk> company more than half the share of the soda market there <unk> said n
<unk> <unk> which also has interests in packaging beer and dairy products holds the <unk> licenses for <unk> and <unk> where per - capita consumption is n't as high as in <unk>
<unk> could be interested in more quickly developing some of the untapped potential in those markets
a <unk> spokesman said n he could n't say whether that is the direction of the talks
<unk> said n the joint - venture arrangement which needs approval from both companies boards should be completed early next year
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said n it increased its quarterly <unk> to n cents a share from n cents payable <unk> n to stock of record <unk> n
the increase follows the company report of strong earnings for the third quarter and reflects what <unk> brands called its tradition of sharing earnings growth with shareholders
<unk> brands is a consumer products company with core businesses in tobacco distilled spirits and life insurance
as of <unk> n <unk> <unk> had n million shares outstanding
<unk> <unk> <unk> announced a transaction that will strengthen its indirect control of <unk> <unk> a. and will admit <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as its first non - family shareholder
<unk> <unk> a limited partnership that is the master holding company for <unk> <unk> family owns approximately n of the shares in <unk> <unk> <unk> which in turn owns approximately n of <unk> <unk> biggest private - sector industrial group
the company said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> sister of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> agreed to trade her shares in <unk> for new ordinary shares in the limited partnership which will give her control of <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>
the <unk> <unk> meanwhile agreed to trade some of his stake in <unk> - based <unk> <unk> another <unk> family company for <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> capital
his new stake would be in the form of preferred shares which receive higher dividends but have voting rights only in extraordinary shareholders assemblies
the <unk> <unk> owns <unk> of <unk> capital while <unk> owns n
as a result of the transaction which is expected to be approved at a shareholders meeting <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> will control <unk> of <unk> ordinary shares
its capital will also be raised to n billion lire n million from the current n billion lire
<unk> also has nonvoting preferred shares which are quoted on the <unk> stock exchange
the value of the two transactions was n't disclosed but an <unk> spokesman said n no cash would change hands
the move strengthens the existing links between the agnellis and the <unk> <unk> the head of the world <unk> moslems who is a longtime family friend and frequently goes sailing with <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> also have some business ties and a spokesman for the <unk> company did n't rule out that the current agreement could lead to further collaboration
for instance <unk> earlier this year bought an <unk> stake in <unk> the <unk> <unk> airline which flies between <unk> and <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> which was formed in <unk> <unk> as a way of keeping the agnellis controlling stake in <unk> together despite an ever - growing family tree has been playing a more active role in the <unk> group of late

congressional democrats and the <unk> administration agreed on a compromise minimum - wage bill opening the way for the first wage - floor boost in more than nine years
the agreement ended a long impasse between the congressional leaders and the <unk> <unk> over the wage issue
<unk> <unk> in <unk> vetoed a measure passed by <unk> and said n he would n't accept any minimum - wage rise that went beyond limits n he set early in this year debate on the issue
the compromise was a somewhat softened version of what the <unk> <unk> had said <unk> it would accept
under the agreement with the <unk> and <unk> leaders the minimum wage would rise from the current n an hour to n an hour by <unk> n
employers could also pay a subminimum training wage for <unk> days to new workers who are up to n years old and then for another <unk> days if the company institutes a specific training program for the newcomers
<unk> <unk> officials were delighted that the compromise includes the concept of a training wage which <unk> <unk> has fought for throughout the year
for the first time in history we have a training wage that will be part of the nation labor laws said <unk> <unk> <unk> assistant to the president for economic and domestic policy
<unk> <unk> aides said that although they made a small compromise on the length of a training wage the final minimum - wage increase will meet the standards set by <unk> <unk>
the bill vetoed by the president in <unk> which the <unk> failed to override would have lifted the minimum wage to n an hour by late <unk> with a training wage for up to two months generally for a worker first job
<unk> <unk> had been holding out for a bill boosting the wage floor to n an hour by the end of <unk> coupled with a six - month training wage for workers newly hired by any employer
under the compromise the <unk> level would be reached nine months earlier while the training subminimum would be shorter unless it is tied to a training plan
democrats argued that the training wage was a way of allowing employers to pay less than the minimum wage while new workers need far less than six months to be trained for their jobs
democrats had been negotiating with some republican congressional leaders on a compromise lately
with congressional elections next year <unk> leaders have worried about opposing a minimum - wage rise for low - paid workers at a time when <unk> is moving toward a capital - gains tax cut that would directly benefit wealthier taxpayers
republicans have been imploring the <unk> <unk> to compromise on the wage issue
in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ranking minority member of the <unk> <unk> have been working on a compromise and their soundings showed that the <unk> appeared to be heading toward enough strength to override another <unk> veto a democratic staff official said <unk>
the <unk> is scheduled to vote this week on the compromise as a substitute to a new democratic bill itself watered down from last spring version
the <unk> will probably vote not long afterward
some democrats thought <unk> they might have compromised too much
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman of the <unk> labor standards subcommittee said <unk> they might have done better if we held their feet to the fire
<unk> <unk> suggested <unk> democrats yielded a great deal on the size of the increase but he cited concessions from the <unk> <unk> on the training wage which he said <unk> make it less harsh
with only n to <unk> eligible n of workers getting less than n an hour who are adults wo n't be subject to the training wage he said n
the <unk> - <unk> which previously opposed the administration subminimum idea said n the compromise has adequate safeguards so the youth are not exploited and older workers are not displaced

the price was n't disclosed but one analyst estimated that it was n million
<unk> which has faced a takeover threat from the <unk> family of <unk> since <unk> said that disposing of the carpet business would improve total financial performance
the move also would allow the company to concentrate on core businesses which include ceramic tile floor coverings and furniture
moreover such a sale could help <unk> reassure its investors and deter the belzbergs who own a <unk> stake in the <unk> <unk> company
analysts expect <unk> to use proceeds of the sale to reduce debt buy back stock or perhaps finance an acquisition
the carpet division had n sales of n million or almost n of <unk> <unk> billion total revenue

the government primary economic - forecasting gauge rose a slight n in <unk> but economists said <unk> the report offered little new information on the degree to which the <unk> economy is slowing
the small increase in the index of leading indicators which had climbed n in <unk> but was unchanged in <unk> does lend support to the view that the economy has slowed noticeably
however it does n't give much of a clue as to whether a recession is on the horizon
i do n't think n it provides much new information on the economy said <unk> <unk> economist at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
so far this year the index of leading indicators has risen in four months fallen in four months and remained unchanged in the other month
in another report yesterday the <unk> <unk> said <unk> sales of new single - family houses plunged n in <unk> to an annual rate of <unk> from <unk> in <unk>
the declines were particularly pronounced in the <unk> and in the <unk> where <unk> <unk> was a factor
although <unk> weakness followed two strong months for home sales the decline supports other indications that the drop in mortgage rates earlier this year has had only a limited beneficial effect on the housing market
the <unk> drop was the largest since a <unk> drop in <unk> <unk> but monthly changes in this measure are even less reliable than those in other economic indicators
because the figures are based on a small sample the department said n it is <unk> confident only that new - home sales fell somewhere between <unk> and <unk> during the month
the department also said n it takes four months to establish a trend
so far this year n newly built homes have been sold down n from the like months of <unk>
the index of leading indicators got a major boost in <unk> from a surge in consumer expectations as measured by the <unk> of <unk>
this measure had dropped sharply in <unk>
the <unk> <unk> said that as a result of a new adjustment to the formula used to calculate the index the influence of this component has been reduced
of the <unk> components to the index only three others rose in <unk> the money supply the length of the average work week and stock prices
several components that track the health of the manufacturing sector of the economy turned down in <unk>
these include new orders for manufactured consumer goods lead times on vendor deliveries orders for new plant and equipment and backlogs of orders for durable goods
meanwhile the <unk> <unk> of <unk> said yesterday <unk> a recent poll of <unk> executives on its board found that <unk> do n't expect a recession to occur until n or later
the remainder expect a downturn to begin sometime
although manufacturers often are quick to call for lower interest rates n of the executives said n they would prefer that the <unk> keep inflation - fighting as its top priority even if that means higher rates
the other <unk> said n the <unk> ought to worry less about inflation and bring interest rates down
all the figures are adjusted to remove usual seasonal patterns
here are the net contributions of the components of the <unk> <unk> index of leading indicators
after various adjustments they produced a <unk> rise in the index for <unk> and a <unk> rise for <unk>

an imaginative novelist writing a thriller about amateur spy - chasing might invent a <unk> <unk> but it unlikely
it also unnecessary
amateur spy - chaser <unk> <unk> is a real person or as he might waggishly put it a surreal person
he is n an astronomer with impressive credentials and something of a genius at making computers do his bidding
he once described himself as a <unk> <unk> and played the role well obligatory ragged jeans a thicket of long hair and rejection of all things conventional including for a time at least formal marriage to his sweetheart <unk> <unk>
he also is an entertaining writer combining wisecracks and wordplay with programmatic detail and lucid explanations of how computers work
in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> pages n he spins a remarkable tale of his efforts over n months to catch a computer spy
the result last spring was the arrest by west german authorities of five young west germans accused of stealing information from computers in the <unk> and <unk> and selling it to the soviet <unk>
one of them <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> allegedly used the international telecommunications network to break into more than <unk> high - security computers in the <unk> searching for secrets
he probably did n't penetrate any top - secret files but the <unk> in <unk> <unk> was willing to pay two of his associates <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> for some of the material <unk> <unk> collected
they promised yet more for really good stuff
<unk> <unk> draws his title from the cuckoo habit of laying eggs in the nests of other birds making them surrogate parents
the computer spy had discovered that a popular editing\/electronic mail program called <unk> - <unk> could do tricks with the widely used <unk> operating system created by <unk>
using <unk> - <unk> the spy could substitute a bogus atrun program for the one that routinely cleans up the <unk> system every five minutes
once his cuckoo egg was laid he could enter <unk> and become a super - user with access to everything
<unk> <unk> was scanning the heavens at the <unk> observatory of the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> when his grant ran low and he was asked to switch to helping run the lab computers
he discovered a n discrepancy in the charges made to various departments for computer time and traced it to a user named <unk> who had no valid billing address
<unk> <unk> suspected <unk> the intruder was one of those precocious students who has fun breaking into computers
but after much tracking it became evident to <unk> <unk> through various clues that the hacker was not on the <unk> campus or even in <unk>
finding him became an obsession for <unk> <unk>
he made a midnight requisition of all the printers <unk> he could lay hands on so that he could monitor all the telephone lines coming into the lab computers
after discovering that the hacker had taken over the dormant account of a legitimate user named <unk> <unk> he rigged up an alarm system including a portable beeper n to alert him when <unk> came on the line
some nights he slept under his desk
his boss complained about neglect of other chores
the hacker was pawing over the <unk> files but also using <unk> and other easily accessible computers as stepping stones to the network of computers used by the military and national security agencies
the <unk> sands missile range and <unk> contractor <unk> <unk> were among the targets
when the hacker moved <unk> <unk> moved too calling up other systems managers to alert them but keeping his own system open to avoid arousing suspicion
sometimes if the hacker seemed to be into a sensitive file he would drag his keychain across the terminal to create static or slow the system down to frustrate his quarry
the <unk> initially showed little interest and he had the impression n other federal security agencies were tangled up in legal red tape
the <unk> told him n it does not do domestic counterespionage
one learns a lot from this book or seems to about crippling federal bureaucracy
seems to because it possible that the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> were more interested than they let on to <unk> <unk>
finally he got help
<unk> is a major network linking computers
one of its international specialists <unk> <unk> took a quick interest in <unk> <unk> hunt ultimately tracing the hacker to <unk> <unk>
the west germans then took over and finally found <unk> <unk>
eventually <unk> <unk> was invited to both the <unk> and <unk> to brief high - ranking officers on computer theft
he savored the humor of his uncombed appearance among these buttoned - up chaps
back in <unk> he was violently scolded by a left - wing lady friend for consorting with such people
he became angry in return
he had developed a hatred for the hacker and a grudging appreciation of the federal spooks who make national security their business
at several different levels it a fascinating tale
<unk> <unk> is deputy editor of the <unk>
<unk> <unk> systems <unk> today will unveil a new general - purpose computer that will compete with more expensive machines from companies such as <unk> microsystems <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
the closely held <unk> <unk> company also will announce an agreement to supply computers to <unk> <unk> <unk> which will sell <unk> machines under its own label
the new <unk> machine called the <unk> will cost n for a basic system
the computer processes n million instructions per second and uses only one central processing chip unlike many rival machines using several processors
the machine employs reduced instruction - set computing or <unk> technology
at that price an analyst familiar with the machine said <unk> the computer offers up to <unk> times the performance of similar machines
in the price range it a tremendously high - performing product said <unk> <unk> an analyst at the market - research firm <unk>
the machine is part of an effort by <unk> to establish itself as a supplier of computers not just of integrated - circuit technology
<unk> also wants to wedge into markets other than traditional <unk> applications such as engineering <unk> said n the new machine will also be used by businesses and for communications
this clearly demonstrates that <unk> is a systems company rather than just a chip company said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the <unk> <unk> deal is a boon for <unk> because it gives the the five - year-old company one more ally as it battles more established electronic concerns such as <unk> <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> for the emerging market for <unk> machines
<unk> technology speeds up a computer by simplifying the internal software
for <unk> which expects revenue of n million this year big - name allies such as <unk> <unk> are essential to attract software developers to the company <unk> architecture
the thing n it says about <unk> is that they on a roll right now said <unk> <unk> at <unk>
they getting some major wins she added
last month for example <unk> agreed to supply its computers to <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> computers <unk> and <unk> <unk> have agreed to sell <unk> computers and companies such as <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> have agreed to make <unk> chips under license
today agreement gives <unk> <unk> a machine n to compete against <unk> and other general - purpose computer makers said <unk> <unk> <unk> a computer - market analyst at <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>
the machine is essentially a mainframe computer he said n
suddenly <unk> <unk> <unk> has a competitive product n to fight back against the <unk> a machine n <unk> announced last month he added n
<unk> <unk> based in <unk> <unk> expects its sales of <unk> systems including the new n to amount to more than n million by the end of <unk> <unk> said n
<unk> <unk> and others will also sell versions of the machine said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> will start shipping its new machine in the first quarter of <unk> he said
the machine uses a single processor which makes it easier n to program than competing machines using several processors
the computer can process n million calculations called floating - point operations every second
the machine can run software written for other <unk> computers the company said n
another fight is brewing between <unk> and the <unk> administration over how to pay for the savings - and-loan bailout without adding to the federal budget deficit
in a hearing before the <unk> ways and means <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> which both are arms of <unk> advised the new s&l bailout agency to abandon plans to raise temporary working capital through debt issued from an agency that would n't be counted on the federal budget
officials of the <unk> <unk> <unk> have said privately that such a plan was the most likely alternative to raise short - term cash for the bailout
instead the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> the <unk> should consider using <unk> debt which is less expensive and subject to oversight by <unk>
the spending could be exempted from meeting deficit - reduction targets in the <unk> - <unk> budget law
the <unk> has projected that it will require between <unk> billion to n billion in temporary working capital
the borrowing n to raise these funds would be paid off as assets of sick thrifts are sold
the new s&l law allows the <unk> to issue notes for as much as <unk> of the value of the assets <unk> it holds
but higher interest rates paid on off - budget debt could add billions to the bailout costs and would n't be subject to congressional scrutiny ways and means members argued n
to allow this massive level of unfettered federal borrowing without prior congressional approval would be irresponsible said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who has introduced a bill n to limit the <unk> authority to issue debt
the <unk> will have to sell or merge hundreds of insolvent thrifts over the next three years
the new s&l bailout law allows n billion to be spent to sell or merge sick s&ls and their assets but that is a net cost
in the meantime the agency must raise cash to maintain assets such as real estate until they can be sold
then the short - term debt is paid off through the proceeds of selling the assets
<unk> <unk> assistant secretary of the <unk> said that the working capital is necessary to reduce the final costs of the bailout by allowing the agency to sell savings and loans without their bad assets then hold the assets until they can be sold under favorable conditions
he said n it has n't yet been determined how the <unk> will raise the cash but the administration does n't want it to be included on the federal budget because it would distort the budget process by requiring either exemptions from <unk> - <unk> or big increases in the budget deficit
but the worst possibility would be raising no working capital he said n
if working capital financing is not provided he said the <unk> may have to slow s&l sales or dump acquired assets through fire sales
<unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> it applied on behalf of two of its subsidiaries to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for permission to build a <unk> n million pipeline system from <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk>

<unk> <unk> <unk> will build and operate the system which will connect the <unk> <unk> with several interstate pipelines

not a gripping question unless you the pastry chef of this city <unk> <unk> restaurant and you just lost your priceless personal dessert notebook
<unk> <unk> was listed among the top n restaurants in the world this year by <unk> magazine
the tattered black binder bulging with n years worth of recipes held together by rubber bands was in chef <unk> <unk> purse when it was stolen from her house recently
the <unk> police do n't have any leads but doubt n the crime was driven by a passion for sweets
instead they figure n the culprit probably took money from <unk> <unk> wallet and discarded all the tips in the five - by-eight-inch looseleaf
<unk> <unk> whose founder <unk> <unk> is considered the inventor of the cooking style known as <unk> cuisine and whose patrons make reservations a month in advance has n't exactly subjected diners to vanilla ice cream because of the theft
for one thing <unk> <unk> can draw on her cookbook published by <unk> <unk> four years ago which is teeming with recipes for such specialties as kiwi sherbet gooseberry fool a creamy dish made with crushed stewed berries and hazelnut oeufs a la neige
for another sympathetic fans have sent <unk> <unk> copies of her recipes clipped from magazines over the years
still the restaurant ever - changing menu of five - course dinners it supposedly has n't repeated a meal since opening in n requires constant improvisation
and that puts added pressure on <unk> <unk> dessert - menu planners

many in the <unk> <unk> pastry community express disbelief that <unk> <unk> kept only one copy of such valuable notes but she has received moral support from <unk> <unk> a group of <unk> pastry chefs that meets regularly to discuss issues like how to keep meringues from weeping and how bovine eating habits affect butter texture
<unk> <unk> has offered a n reward for the book return but figures n she have to reinvent many recipes from scratch
it an overwhelming job she says
there are so many possible proportions when you consider how many things are made out of eggs and butter and milk

the <unk> <unk> garment service company also boosted its quarterly dividend n to three cents a share adjusted for the split
the dividend had been five cents a share
the split and quarterly dividend will be payable <unk> n to stock of record <unk> n the company said n

<unk> <unk> said <unk> it completed the previously reported sale of approximately n acres of timberland near <unk> <unk> to closely held <unk> <unk> industries <unk> <unk> <unk> for n million
the lumber insulation and fireproofing concern said <unk> the transaction which includes a swap of other timber interests would result in a n million after - tax gain n to be recorded in the fourth quarter
<unk> <unk> <unk> said n it reached a n standstill agreement with its <unk> affiliate calling for <unk> to pay <unk> n million right away and additional amounts in the future
under the agreement <unk> a manager of health - care facilities said n it would pay <unk> n million in overdue rent and mortgage payments and repay n million in funds that <unk> advanced for construction work on facilities
in return <unk> agreed that it wo n't exercise its rights and remedies against <unk> during the n period
after the payment <unk> still will be n million in arrears on rent and mortgage payments to <unk> a real estate investment trust whose portfolio consists largely of properties operated by <unk>
<unk> has given <unk> a <unk> note for that overdue amount n to be repaid over three years
in addition <unk> agreed to make monthly rent and mortgage payments of n million to n million to <unk> during the standstill period n to be paid when <unk> successfully completes asset sales
because <unk> actually owes <unk> n million in rent and mortgage payments each month the amount due above the amount paid will be added to the three - year note
the funds should help ease a cash bind at <unk> which has been unable to pay its debts because <unk> has n't made complete rent and mortgage payments since <unk>
a spokesman said <unk> <unk> has paid two of the three banks n it owed interest to in <unk> and is in negotiations with the third bank

i was pleased to note that your <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> item recognized the money - fund concept as one of the significant events of the past century
actually about two years ago the <unk> listed the creation of the money fund as one of the n most significant events in the world of finance in the <unk> century
but the <unk> <unk> <unk> first money fund was not named nor were the creators of the money - fund concept <unk> <unk> and myself
we innovated telephone redemptions daily dividends total elimination of share certificates and the constant <unk> pershare pricing all of which were painfully thought out and not the result of some inadvertence on the part of the <unk>
the <unk>
the crowning moment in the career of <unk> <unk> <unk> came as <unk> local and state dignitaries packed into his elegant marble - columned courtroom here last year for his swearing in as <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
baskets of roses and potted palms adorned his bench
the local <unk> <unk> color guard led the way
as the judge marched down the center aisle in his flowing black robe he was heralded by a trumpet fanfare
to many it was a ceremony more befitting a king than a rural judge seated in the isolated foothills of the southern <unk> mountains
but then <unk> <unk> often behaved like a man who would be king and some say an arrogant and abusive one
while his case may be extreme it reflects the vulnerability of many small communities to domineering judges
last <unk> nine months after the judge swearing - in the state attorney general office indicted him on a sweeping array of charges alleging more than n years of official oppression in <unk> <unk> a depressed steel and mining community in western <unk>
the allegations ranging from theft and bribery to coercion and lewdness paint a disquieting picture
according to testimony in a public n grand - jury report handed up to the state attorney general <unk> <unk> extorted cash from lawyers muscled favorable loans from banks and bullied local businesses for more than a decade
prosecutors in an indictment based on the grand jury report maintain that at various times since n he owned a secret and illegal interest in a beer distributorship plotted hidden ownership interests in real estate that presented an alleged conflict of interest set up a dummy corporation n to buy a car and obtain insurance for his former girlfriend now his second wife and maintained n accounts in six banks in <unk> <unk>
in testimony recorded in the grand jury report court employees said <unk> the judge now n years old harassed his secretaries made imperial demands on his staff and hounded anyone who crossed him
bailiffs claimed n they were required to chauffeur him to and from work mow his lawn chop his wood fix his car and even drop by his house to feed his two grown mutts <unk> and <unk>
one former bailiff charged that the judge double - crossed him by reneging on a promise of a better paying job after pocketing a n bribe
some of the allegations are simply bizarre
two former secretaries told the grand jury n they were summoned to the judge chambers on separate occasions to take dictation only to find the judge in his bikini underwear
one secretary testified that the judge once called her to his office while wearing nothing at all
the judge suspended from his bench pending his trial which began this week vehemently denies all the allegations against him calling them ludicrous and imaginative political demagoguery
he blames the indictment on local political feuding unhappiness with his aggressive efforts to clear the courthouse docket and a vendetta by state investigators and prosecutors angered by some of his rulings against them
i do n't know whose toes i stepped on says the judge
i find out eventually who pushed the state police buttons into action
even if only some of the allegations stand up however they provide ample testimony to the awesome power of judges in rural communities
that power can sometimes be abused particularly since jurists in smaller jurisdictions operate without many of the restraints that serve as corrective measures in urban areas
lawyers and their clients who frequently bring business to a country courthouse can expect to appear before the same judge year after year
fear of alienating that judge is pervasive says <unk> <unk> <unk> founder and director of the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> . a public interest group that researches rural justice issues
as a result says <unk> <unk> <unk> lawyers think twice before appealing a judge ruling are reluctant to mount or even support challenges against him for re - election and are usually loath to file complaints that might impugn a judge integrity
<unk> <unk> a stern and forbidding - looking man has been a fixture in the local legal community for more than two decades
the son of an immigrant stonemason of slovenian descent he was raised in a small borough outside <unk> the <unk> <unk> seat and put himself through the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>
he graduated near the top of his class serving on the school law review with <unk> <unk> who went on to become governor of <unk> and now <unk> <unk> <unk>
it was also in law school that <unk> <unk> and his first wife had the first of seven daughters
he divorced his first wife three years ago and married the daughter of his court clerk
last year <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> called <unk> <unk> one of the finest judges not only in <unk> but in the <unk> <unk>
clearly the judge has had his share of accomplishments
after practicing law locally he was elected to his first <unk> term as judge in <unk> in <unk> he was effectively re - elected
six years ago <unk> <unk> was voted president of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> by the state n judges
he has been considered several times for appointments to federal district and appellate court vacancies in <unk>
and when he ran unsuccessfully for a state appellate court seat in <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> rated him one of the best available after interviewing local lawyers
he probably was the smartest guy who ever sat on our bench says a former president of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> association who like most lawyers in <unk> <unk> refuses to talk about the judge publicly
he sharp as a tack
he could grasp an issue with the blink of an eye
for more than a decade virtually no one complained about <unk> <unk>
what about those institutions that are supposed to be the bedrock of society the banks and the bar association wrote a columnist for the <unk> - <unk> a newspaper in nearby <unk> shortly after the scandal became public
if only a banker or a lawyer had spoken out years ago the judicial process would n't be under the taint n it is today
officials with the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> the arm of the state that investigates judicial misconduct counter that they had no inkling of anything amiss in <unk>
nobody told us nobody called us says an official close to the case who asked not to be named
nobody had the guts n to complain
certainly not the lawyers
<unk> attorney <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> shelled out n in loans to the judge over five years he said <unk> in testimony to the grand jury
the judge never made a pretense of repaying the money said <unk> <unk>
eventually <unk> <unk> testified n he began ducking out of his office rather than face the judge when he visited
when <unk> <unk> won a n verdict in a land condemnation case against the state in <unk> n he says n <unk> <unk> unexpectedly awarded him an additional n
<unk> <unk> thought little of it he told the grand jury <unk> until the judge walked up to him after the courtroom had cleared and suggested a kickback
do n't you think <unk> i ought to get a commission or part of your fee in this case <unk> <unk> said <unk> the judge asked him
appalled <unk> <unk> never paid the money he testified n
but he did n't complain to the state <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> either saying later that he feared retribution
<unk> <unk> said n he will respond to <unk> <unk> allegation at his trial
like most of <unk> <unk> lawyers and residents who had dealings with the judge <unk> <unk> declined to be interviewed for this article
and no one with a complaint about the judge would allow his name to be printed
i do n't have anything much n to say and i think n that what you going to find from everyone else n you talk to up here says local attorney <unk> <unk> <unk>
says another lawyer the practice of law is a matter of biting one lip when you live in a small community
one had best not dance on top of a coffin until the lid is sealed tightly shut
the judge was considered imperious abrasive and ambitious those who practiced before him say <unk>
he sipped tea sweetened with honey from his high - backed leather chair at his bench while scribbling notes ordering spectators to stop whispering or to take off their hats in his courtroom
four years ago he jailed all nine members of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for several hours after they defied his order to extend the school year by several weeks to make up for time lost during a teachers strike
visitors in his chambers say n he could cite precisely the years months weeks and days remaining until mandatory retirement would force aside the presiding president judge giving <unk> <unk> the seniority required to take over as the county top court administrator
the judge they say <unk> was fiercely proud of his abilities and accomplishments
my name is judge <unk> <unk> told a car salesman in ebensburg when he bought a new red <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> according to the grand - jury report
the dealership dutifully recorded the sale under the name <unk> <unk>
yet despite the judge imperial bearing no one ever had reason n to suspect possible wrongdoing says <unk> <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> <unk> bar association
the arrogance of a judge his demeanor the way n he handles people are not a basis for filing a complaint says <unk> <unk>
until this came up and hit the press there was never any indication that he was doing anything wrong
state investigators dispute that view now particularly in light of the judge various business dealings in <unk> <unk>
the judge came under scrutiny in late n after the state attorney general office launched an unrelated investigation into corruption in <unk> <unk>
the inquiry soon focused on the judge
even his routine business transactions caused trouble according to the grand jury report
when the judge bought his new <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> - <unk> in <unk> five years ago the dealership had certain apprehensions about the judge reputation according to the grand - jury report
the dealership took the extra step of having all the paper work for the transaction pre - approved by <unk> local lender <unk> <unk>
then as an additional precaution the car dealership took the judge photograph as he stood next to his new car with sales papers in hand proof that he had received the loan documents
but when the judge received his payment book he disavowed the deal
there was no loan there is no loan there never shall be a loan the judge wrote the bank on his judicial stationery according to the report
later the judge went a step farther
after <unk> <unk> tried to repossess the car a vice president asked him to intervene in an unrelated legal dispute involving a trust account
the judge wrote again
i find myself in an adversary relationship with <unk> <unk> and i am not inclined to extend myself as far as any favors are concerned the judge wrote back in a letter attached to the grand jury report
perhaps if my personal matters can be resolved with <unk> bank in the near future i may be inclined to reconsider your request
the judge now says <unk> it was unfortunate that he chose to write the letter but says there was certainly no intent to extort there
the bank acquiesced
it refinanced the judge loan lowered its interest rate and accepted a trade - in that had n't originally been part of the deal a beat up <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the dealer had to repair before it could be resold
the incident was n't the only time n the judge got special treatment from his local bank
two years later he wrote to complain that the interest n he was paying on an unsecured <unk> loan was absolutely onerous
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> president at the time quickly responded
the bank he wrote back <unk> was immediately lowering the rate by <unk> as a concession to you
the judge says n he ca n't discuss in detail how he will defend himself at his trial although he contends that if he were as corrupt as state prosecutors believe he would be far wealthier than he is
his seven - bedroom cedar and brick house outside of <unk> is up for sale to pay for his lawyers
the judge says n he is confident n he will return to his old bench
already he notes n the n charges originally filed against him have been trimmed to <unk>
most of the allegations no longer pending were ethics charges withdrawn by state prosecutors as part of a pre - trial agreement
the heart of the case official oppression remains intact
if i lose i lose my position my career my pension my home and my investments says the judge
my <unk> and i know n i am correct and innocent

the surprise announcement came after the <unk> broke off negotiations with <unk> <unk> on a settlement of the one - time tycoon personal bankruptcy case
although the action removes one obstacle in the way of an overall settlement to the case it also means that <unk> <unk> could be stripped of virtually all of his assets if the <unk> <unk> rules against him in a <unk> case heard earlier this year in <unk> <unk>
the <unk> has been seeking more than n million in back taxes from <unk> <unk>
separately a federal judge hearing <unk> <unk> bankruptcy case yesterday turned down a proposed n million settlement between <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> another major creditor in the case
the peruvian minerals concern had been seeking a claim of n million against <unk> <unk>
in addition to turning down the compromise <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> he would allow a claim of only n million

regarding <unk> <unk> taxes he and the <unk> have apparently agreed on a basic formula for liquidating his estate in which the <unk> would get <unk> of the proceeds from a liquidating trust and <unk> would go to other creditors
but they have been at odds over how much <unk> <unk> would owe the government after his assets are sold
the <unk> had demanded n million but <unk> <unk> would agree to no more than n million

<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> attorney said <unk> his client welcomed the gamble

<unk> has found another safe outlet for its money <unk> home mortgages
an increasing number of big japanese investors are buying up <unk> home mortgages that have been pooled and packaged for sale as interest - bearing instruments known as mortgage - backed securities
as much as <unk> of new <unk> mortgage securities issued by the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> now flow into japanese hands
that may not come as a surprise to americans who have watched the japanese snap up properties in the <unk> from golf courses to a stake in <unk> <unk>
but it marks a big change for the japanese who shunned mortgage securities after getting burned by a big downturn in interest rates a few years back
you ca n't say n it a tsunami tidal wave but we making some headway says <unk> <unk> chairman <unk> <unk> <unk> who visits <unk> at least once a year to explain and drum up investor interest in mortgage securities
interest is a great deal higher than it was a year ago
the steady growth of the mortgage securities market in the <unk> has even triggered talk of building up a similar market here
evidence of the growing japanese demand for mortgage securities abounds
earlier this year <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> investment bank had no trouble selling out a special n million mortgage - securities trust n it created for japanese investors
<unk> <unk> of <unk> which claims to be the biggest japanese buyer of <unk> mortgage securities says n it will more than double its purchases this year to an amount n one official puts at several billion dollars
and a <unk> <unk> seminar this week promises to draw hundreds of prospective investors who can be expected to channel tens of billions of dollars into the market in the next few years
last year there were only several big investors who were interested says <unk> <unk> a vice president at the international arm of <unk> securities <unk>
this year some investors are changing their policies and investing a lot
ultimately he says <unk> strong demand could help to drive down interest rates on mortgage securities
at the moment <unk> is the only japanese institution authorized to act as a primary seller of <unk> <unk> instruments
but other japanese institutions say privately that they are considering asking to join the <unk> selling group
these securities are attractive to japanese investors for three reasons
first they are safe
while they are n't backed by the full faith and credit of the <unk> government as <unk> bonds are it is widely assumed that the government would support them if necessary
<unk> <unk> bonds are still the dollar - denominated investment of choice for long - term japanese investors
second they are liquid
the secondary market in federally backed mortgage securities now exceeds <unk> billion or nearly half of the <unk> trillion in <unk> residential mortgages issued
third they offer high yields
at the moment some offer as much as <unk> to n percentage points over <unk> securities of similar maturities
but there is a risk which the japanese discovered when they first dipped their toes into the market nearly five years ago
since most mortgages can be prepaid or refinanced at any time issuers of mortgage securities retain the right to buy back their bonds before maturity
that a headache for long - term investors since it forces them to reinvest their money usually at lower rates than the original mortgage securities carried
two or three years ago the problem was that people did n't understand the prepayment risk says <unk> <unk> <unk>
so they were surprised and very disappointed by prepayment
compounding the trouble to japanese investors mortgage securities pay interest monthly since most mortgages require homeowners to make monthly payments
but japanese institutional investors are used to quarterly or semiannual payments on their investments so the monthly cash flow posed administrative problems
as a result japanese investors steered clear of the mortgage securities
but they did n't lose touch with the <unk> issuers
since <unk> japanese investors have bought nearly <unk> of n billion in <unk> <unk> corporate debt issued to foreigners money that <unk> <unk> uses to buy mortgages from <unk> banks
and japanese investors took up nearly all of two n million real <unk> <unk> <unk> conduits a kind of collateralized mortgage obligation that were offered to foreigners this year
in addition further packaging of mortgage - backed securities such as <unk> fund have reduced the effects of prepayment risk and automatically reinvest monthly payments so institutions do n't have to
<unk> <unk> for years has offered a so - called participation certificate that guarantees n it wo n't be prepaid for a set number of years and offers semiannual payments
as <unk> - <unk> bid for <unk> <unk> <unk> has shown <unk> uninvited takeovers are still alive despite premature reports of their demise
therefore the debate about poison pills will continue to rage in the boardrooms of corporations and the halls of academia
although poison pills come in different colors and shapes they usually give current shareholders the right to buy more stock of their corporation at a large discount if certain events occur typically if a hostile bidder acquires more than a specified percentage of the corporation stock
however these discount purchase rights may generally be redeemed at a nominal cost by the corporation directors if they approve of a bidder
supporters of poison pills argue that their adoption forces bidders to negotiate with a corporation directors who are thereby put in a better position <unk> to pursue the long - term interests of the corporation
recent studies by <unk> <unk> conclude that corporations with poison pills have experienced greater stock - price appreciation than corporations without poison pills during the past few years
critics of poison pills argue that they harm shareholders by letting corporate management defeat takeover bids at premium prices and by deterring premium bids from ever being made to shareholders
these critics are backed by several academic studies showing that the adoption of poison pills reduces shareholder values not merely in the short run but also over longer periods
institutional investors that must evaluate poison pills on a regular basis are interested less in this general debate than in the answers to specific questions about the corporation issuing the pill
does this corporation have a high - quality management team with a good track record
does this team have a viable strategy for improving shareholder values and does this strategy require implementation over an extended period
will the adoption of this particular form of a poison pill significantly improve the chances for management to carry out this strategy
if the answers to these questions are affirmative then institutional investors are likely to be favorably disposed toward a specific poison pill
however the problem is that once most poison pills are adopted they survive forever
although the current management team may be outstanding who will be the ceo in <unk> years
although the five - year strategy may be excellent what will be the strategy in <unk> years
the solution to this problem is a time - limited poison pill
the limit could range from three years to seven years depending on the composition of the management team and the nature of its strategic plan
at the end of this period the poison pill would be eliminated automatically unless a new poison pill were approved by the then - current shareholders who would have an opportunity to evaluate the corporation strategy and management team at that time
one rare example of a time - limited poison pill is the shareholder rights plan adopted by <unk> last year after it received a huge litigation settlement from <unk>
<unk> poison pill covers five years in order to give current management enough time n to put these proceeds to work in a prudent manner
another interesting example is the poison pill adopted recently by <unk> - based <unk> <unk> <unk> a diversified holding company
the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> which owned about n of the company voting stock worked with management to devise a time - limited poison pill
this pill automatically expires after three years unless continued by a vote of the shareholders
the attitude of the <unk> <unk> <unk> reflects a growing receptivity to time - limited poison pills on the part of institutional investors as shown by the discussions at recent meetings of the <unk> of <unk> investors and my informal survey of several retirement plans with large stock positions
more widespread time limits on poison pills would allow shareholders to evaluate a specific poison pill within the context of a specific management team strategy
such concrete analysis is likely to lead to more fruitful dialogue between management and shareholders than the abstract debate about poison pills
<unk> <unk> is the general counsel and a managing director of <unk> investments in <unk>
<unk> <unk> former president and chief executive officer of <unk> <unk> failed to win election to the company board at a special shareholder meeting
<unk> <unk> said after the meeting that he had filed separate lawsuits in the <unk> <unk> <unk> for unjust dismissal against <unk> and for libel against its largest shareholder <unk> <unk> <unk> and two executives of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which controls <unk> <unk>
holders at the meeting elected a full slate of <unk> <unk> nominees to <unk> <unk> board
<unk> <unk> and <unk> have been feuding for months
yesterday election was a sequel to <unk> annual meeting in <unk> when <unk> <unk> disallowed proxies in favor of two <unk> nominees
the <unk> <unk> <unk> overturned <unk> <unk> decision
he later resigned from his executive positions with <unk> saying that actions by its board amounted to my dismissal

<unk> is a holding company with interests in manufacturing concerns
it is n owned by <unk> <unk> another holding company
<unk> is a merchant bank controlled by <unk> financiers <unk> and <unk> <unk>
all the concerns are based in <unk>
buying n of <unk> <unk> <unk> is right up <unk> <unk> <unk> alley in one sense the huge japanese real estate company is entering a long - term relationship with a similarly conservative <unk> owner of tony urban property
but in another sense the n million purchase is uncharacteristically nervy industry analysts say n
the usually cautious giant will become the majority owner of the company that owns <unk> <unk> beloved <unk> <unk> at a time when tensions over japanese purchases of <unk> property are at an all - time high
officials of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> prefer to focus on the affinities nearly dismissing the threat of a backlash from the <unk> public
we think n there will be positive as well as negative reactions says <unk> <unk> senior vice president and chief financial officer of <unk> <unk>
on balance we think n it will be positive
but some japanese government officials and businessmen worry that the prominent purchase is just the sort of deal that should be avoided for the time being
in particular they criticize the timing coming as it does on the heels of <unk> <unk> controversial purchase of <unk> pictures <unk> <unk>
officially yes we encourage the free flow of direct investment says a <unk> <unk> official
but they did n't have to choose this particular moment
during the past year government officials and leading business organizations have repeatedly urged japanese companies to refrain from flashy real estate purchases in
since the <unk> <unk> other major real estate purchases in the <unk> include <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> n million purchase of an office building at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> n million purchase of the <unk> <unk> part of <unk> <unk> in <unk>
in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was sold to <unk> <unk> for n million in <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> paid n million for <unk> <unk> <unk> last year
altogether annual japanese investment in <unk> commercial real estate grew from about <unk> billion in <unk> to about <unk> billion in <unk>
many japanese companies have taken the warnings by the country leaders to heart and sought development partnerships rather than landmark properties
critics say <unk> <unk> <unk> decision to buy into <unk> reflects the degree to which companies are irritated by the pressure to act for the good of <unk>
those who have no money and are n't buying think n it right to refrain but those with money who want to buy for themselves pay no attention says an official of the <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk>
but to <unk> <unk> the acquisition has just the elements that should win support from both sides
first of all it is a friendly acquisition in which <unk> sought out <unk> <unk> and asked it to buy a majority share
secondly the two companies found a similarity in their business and development philosophies and intend to cooperate in a range of activities from real estate to telecommunications
finally <unk> <unk> has no plans to interfere with <unk> management beyond taking a place on the board
we continue to work with them in keeping with the reputation of the company and we rely very much on their leadership says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> may well have found its match in <unk> <unk> a company of long history strong government ties and sound resources
in asset terms <unk> <unk> is the largest real estate firm in <unk>
the core of its holdings is <unk> square meters of incredibly expensive property in the <unk> district the business and financial center of <unk> often jokingly called <unk> <unk>
the <unk> family company acquired that property from the government some n years ago when it was a portion of samurai residential land running from the moat of the <unk> <unk> east toward the hodgepodge of tiny shops and twisted alleys that made up the merchants district
at the time <unk> had just opened its doors to the world after about n years of isolation and needed a western - style business center
<unk> built the government dream development the story goes n in exchange for the official decision to locate <unk> central railway station there
that was just an early step in a relationship with government that has earned the <unk> group the dubious moniker of seisho literally government - business a title that has the pejorative connotation of doing the government bidding but also suggests the clout inherent in maintaining such close ties
<unk> <unk> is one of the dozens of companies in today <unk> group
it known for its cautiousness in part because it has had little need for bold overseas ventures in the year ended <unk> <unk> <unk> of its total revenue came from office building management
its earnings can rise n to <unk> annually simply from the natural turnover of tenants and automatic rent increases says <unk> <unk> <unk> an industry analyst at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
for the latest fiscal year the company net income jumped a robust n to n billion yen n million
for <unk> <unk> the <unk> purchase will catapult it firmly into the overseas real estate business the one area where it has lagged notably behind japanese competitors such as <unk> which had purchased the <unk> <unk>
japanese companies need to invest in overseas real estate for diversification says <unk> <unk> <unk> an industry analyst at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is n't the first overseas purchase for <unk> <unk> it has already played a leading role in designing <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
but the <unk> investment is its largest
nonetheless it will barely make a dent in <unk> <unk> finances analysts say n
<unk> <unk> has n't decided how it will raise the funds for the purchase which are due in cash next <unk> but the <unk> holdings alone are estimated to have a market value of as much as n trillion yen to n trillion yen
moreover as a member of the <unk> group which is headed by one of <unk> largest banks it is sure to win a favorable loan
analysts say n the company also could easily issue new convertible bonds or warrants
meanwhile at home <unk> has control of some major projects
it is the largest private - sector landowner of the <unk> - <unk> <unk> project a multibillion - yen development in the port city of <unk> about an hour outside <unk>
the project is one of a select group of public projects opened to <unk> firms under a u.s.-japan construction trade agreement reached last year
the centerpiece of that complex the <unk> <unk> will be <unk> tallest building when it is completed in <unk>
<unk> is also pushing ahead with a controversial plan to redevelop <unk> into a business center of high - tech buildings a project budgeted for n years and six trillion yen
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> may be today public enemies but the two entertainment giants could end up becoming partners in a number of ventures as part of a settlement of their acrimonious legal dispute over <unk> producers <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
the <unk> bros. studio and <unk> signaled n they are close to a settlement yesterday asking a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to postpone a hearing scheduled for tomorrow on <unk> request for a preliminary injunction blocking <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> from taking the top posts at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
in separate statements the two sides said n they want to have further discussions
<unk> is acquiring <unk> and <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> in two separate transactions valued at more than n billion
<unk> communications <unk> which is being acquired by <unk> <unk> has filed a n billion breach - of-contract suit against <unk> and the two producers
<unk> has a five - year exclusive contract with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> that requires them to make movies exclusively at the <unk> bros. studio
the two sides in the legal battle have hurled accusations of duplicity at each other for weeks and both <unk> and <unk> have accused each other of trying to sabotage each other prospects for success in the entertainment business
but it may amount to little more than posturing the two have continued on - again off - again settlement talks over the last few weeks and people familiar with the talks say n the matter could be resolved within a week
both <unk> and <unk> declined to comment on the terms of the settlement discussions
but the people familiar with the talks said that <unk> is n't expected to get any cash in the settlement
instead <unk> is likely to agree to let <unk> participate in certain of its businesses such as the record club of <unk> <unk> records unit
<unk> has surpassed <unk> as the largest record company but it does n't have a powerful world - wide record club like <unk>
the two sides are also discussing certain business ventures involving cable rights to <unk> movies
in addition <unk> is expected to agree to swap <unk> <unk> stake in the sprawling <unk> <unk> studio that <unk> and <unk> share in exchange for the old <unk> studio lot that <unk> acquired with the purchase of <unk> telepictures <unk>
still it may be tough for the two to have a smooth partnership in anything in the wake of sworn affidavits filed over the last week
one for example came from <unk> records <unk> <unk> <unk> who will head a committee that will oversee <unk> entertainment division including both records and movies
in his affidavit <unk> <unk> accused <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of having an antisony anti - japanese bias and said that <unk> <unk> had tried to talk him out of letting <unk> buy <unk> records two years ago for that reason
<unk> <unk> who will be chairman and co - chief executive officer of <unk> <unk> after the merger is complete denied that in his own affidavit and called <unk> <unk> remarks vicious and his claims reckless irresponsible and baseless saying <unk> <unk> under his leadership has started a number of businesses in <unk>
<unk> <unk> also said n he enjoys warm professional and personal relationships with japanese executives including <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who has visited my home here
but despite the acrimony between <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> officials of the <unk> side of <unk> <unk> have reportedly been increasingly interested in a settlement that might yield attractive business opportunities
<unk> executives such as the company president <unk> <unk> who will eventually be co - chief executive of <unk> <unk> alongside <unk> <unk> have no personal relationships or ego at stake in the fight over the <unk> - <unk> duo and were never directly drawn into the fray
talks between the two sides could unravel of course as they have more than once since <unk> announced its plans to hire <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
but both sides appear to be more willing now to meet each other terms to resolve the issue
and although <unk> has said <unk> it wanted the producers to fulfill the terms of their contract the producers said in sworn court declarations that they did n't believe <unk> the relationship could be repaired after the acrimony of the legal battle
any settlement is also expected to exclude <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> from any of the projects n they were working on at <unk>
the <unk> - <unk> duo have n projects in various stages of development and production at <unk> including <unk> of the vanities and a <unk> shining lie
but that does n't mean <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> might not eventually get their hands on some of their projects studios develop hundreds of movies but produce only <unk> to n each year
once a studio chooses not to actually make a movie that is in development producers are typically free to take it elsewhere
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> also almost certainly would n't be able to participate in future sequels to batman the blockbuster hit <unk> they produced for <unk>
but in acquiring <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> will actually get a piece of the profits from <unk> since the publicly held concern gets certain revenue from the movies <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> produce
the two producers own a combined <unk> stake in <unk> - <unk>

and our action today will allow <unk> <unk> to avoid prolonged distracting legal proceedings
he did not say what effect if any the n fine would have on the company earnings
<unk> <unk> said <unk> yesterday plea by <unk> <unk> which came after months of negotiations was based on evidence that <unk> <unk> had set up an elaborate payment system through which it reimbursed outside vendors primarily three <unk> advertising agencies for making illegal political contributions on its behalf

i surprised n they doing this says <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> <unk> which markets <unk> <unk> scotches
i would be very leery of anything that says if you drink more you get more
others question the impact on <unk> upscale image of a promotion that has customers soaking off labels
it really bizarre says <unk> <unk> creative director at the <unk> <unk> <unk> ad agency
<unk> has an image of something n you would savor rather than guzzle
<unk> <unk> is n't the first such promotion
last year <unk> <unk> offered <unk> <unk> frequent flier miles in exchange for a label
and <unk> gave discounts on scottish merchandise to people who sent in bottle labels
but the scope of <unk> <unk> promotion sets it apart
the current campaign is just the first leg of an aggressive three - to-five-year direct marketing plan

jewelry makers copy cosmetics sales
for years costume jewelry makers fought a losing battle
jewelry displays in department stores were often cluttered and uninspired
and the merchandise was well fake
as a result marketers of faux gems steadily lost space in department stores to more fashionable rivals cosmetics makers
but lately retailers say <unk> fake has become more fashionable
and jewelry makers are beginning to use many of the same marketing tricks honed in the aggressive world of cosmetics
last year the total women fashion jewelry business topped n billion says <unk> <unk> <unk> editor of <unk> magazine

<unk> <unk> <unk> the korean evangelist - industrialist who in n founded the <unk> <unk> remains the mystery man behind a multimillion - dollar political and publishing operation based in this country and catering to the american right
but there may be less there than meets the eye
<unk> <unk> planned to convert millions of americans to his unique brand of <unk> in which he plays the role of <unk> <unk> - style temporal political messiah and then to make the <unk> part of a unified international theocracy
his original strategy in itself a brilliant innovation for spreading a religion was to create new economic enterprises each time n he wanted to extend and fund his various religious missions
tax - exempt airport and street - corner solicitations were intended only to provide start - up funds
more stable industries were to build an economically viable infrastructure for the <unk> movement in <unk> <unk> as they had in <unk> and <unk> <unk>
then he would move his movement to <unk>
but that was not to be
throughout the n and early n spokesmen for both the <unk> <unk> and its opponents in the anticult movement gave wildly exaggerated membership figures
their legacy lives on
it is still common to read in the press that the church has n or more full - time american members and n associates
some estimates have gone as high as n members
but internal church documents clearly show that at its publicity - seeking heights as when it organized a spectacular <unk> <unk> bicentennial rally in <unk> there actually were only about n full - time <unk> <unk> members in the
<unk> <unk> support for a <unk> - beleaguered <unk> <unk> the <unk> scandal and his prison sentence for income - tax evasion did not help the church recruitment efforts
defections burnouts and abduction deprogrammings kept member turnover high
that the membership number has even kept close to its <unk> size is the result of the graying of the church
many of the enthusiastic young moonies of the <unk> era who remained faithful to <unk> <unk> are now parents producing new members by procreation rather than conversion
the reputed wealth of the <unk> <unk> is another matter of contention
for a while in the n it seemed <unk> <unk> <unk> was on a spending spree with such purchases as the former <unk> <unk> <unk> and its adjacent <unk> <unk> a fishing\/processing conglomerate with branches in <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> a former <unk> brothers monastery and the <unk> family mansion both picturesquely situated on the <unk> <unk> shares in banks from <unk> to <unk> a motion picture production company and newspapers such as the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> originally the <unk> <unk> and the successful spanish - language <unk> <unk> <unk>

for years a strict regimen governed the staff meetings at <unk> <unk> <unk> technical center in <unk> western suburbs
employees wore identification badges listing not only their names but also their dates of hire
no one could voice an opinion until everybody with more seniority had spoken first so younger employees often the most enthusiastic and innovative seldom spoke up at all
but in <unk> the badges and the do n't speak out of turn rule were abolished early steps in a cultural revolution still rolling on with all the subtlety of a freight train
in recent years <unk> has instituted flex - time work schedules and allowed employees to dress casually even in blue jeans
a rule forbidding staffers to own competitors cars has been lifted and now many designers drive foreign cars to get useful ideas
<unk> decades - old corporate song filled with references to <unk> <unk> has been scrapped in favor of a snappy tune sung by a popular japanese vocalist
and in a japanese corporate first <unk> recently opened the first coed company dormitory for single employees at the suburban <unk> technical center
we had lots of internal debate about this one concedes <unk> <unk> a senior public - relations official
but in the end top management decided to follow the voice of the younger generation
this corporate glasnost is a big reason n <unk> after years of making lackluster cars and lousy profits has loosened up its rigid ways and now is riding a string of hits ranging from the sleek <unk> sedan and <unk> - like n to the whimsically nostalgic <unk> a minicar sold only in <unk>
the company turnaround is far from complete many crucial tests are just beginning
but its surprising progress so far holds important lessons for companies in trouble
the big one a company culture ca n't be radically changed unless top management first admits that things have gone badly awry and then publicly leads the charge
<unk> <unk> <unk> executive vice president for finance helped set the tone in <unk> n when the company was heading toward the first operating loss by a japanese auto maker since the nation postwar recovery
this is a time of self - criticism n to discover what is wrong with us he said
<unk> <unk> who took the helm as <unk> president in <unk> <unk> added simply i am deeply disappointed
no wonder
<unk> <unk> second - largest auto maker and the world fourth - largest was getting beat up not only by its bigger rival <unk> <unk> <unk> but also by <unk> <unk> <unk> the most successful japanese car company in the <unk> but a relative pipsqueak in <unk>
<unk> market share in <unk> had been dropping year by year since the beginning of the decade
its <unk> sales sagged partly because of price increases due to the rising yen
<unk> of all <unk> was preoccupied with management infighting cronyism and corporate rigidity
consider the experience of <unk> <unk> a <unk> designer of vehicle interiors who joined <unk> in <unk>
at that time tasks were assigned strictly on the basis of seniority
the oldest designer got to work on the dashboard she recalls
the next level down did doors
if a new person got to work on part of the speedometer that was a big deal
this system produced boring boxy cars that consumers just were n't buying
desperately hoping to spark sales <unk> transferred n middle managers and plant workers to dealerships
meanwhile <unk> <unk> ordered everyone from top executives to rookie designers to go town watching to visit chic parts of <unk> to try to gain insights into developing cars for trend - setters
some town - watching excursions were downright comic
one group of middle - aged manufacturing men from the company <unk> plant outside <unk> was supposed to check out a trendy restaurant in the city
but when they arrived at the door all were afraid to go in fearing that they would be out of place
other trips were more productive
<unk> <unk> himself visited <unk> headquarters in <unk> upscale <unk> district
he liked the well - lighted lobby display of <unk> cars and trucks so much that he had <unk> gloomy lobby exhibit refurbished
later <unk> borrowed other <unk> practices including an engineering idea contest n to promote inventiveness
one engineer developed a crab car that moves sideways
such sudden cultural shifts may come across as a bit forced but they seem to be genuine so much so in fact that some older employees have resisted
<unk> handled the die - hards in a typically japanese fashion they were n't fired but instead were neglected says <unk> <unk> <unk> the personnel manager at the <unk> <unk> <unk>
despite the pain of adjusting the cultural revolution has begun to yield exciting cars
a year ago the company completely revamped its near - luxury sedan the <unk> <unk> which competes against a broad range of upscale sedans it replaced its boxy pug - nosed body with sleek aerodynamic lines
since then <unk> also has launched new versions of the <unk> <unk> sporty coupe and <unk> sports car
the restyled n costs as much as <unk> and is squared off against the <unk> <unk> which begins at n
besides new styling the new nissans have more powerful engines and more sophisticated suspension systems
all three new models are outselling their predecessors by wide margins
in its home market <unk> has grabbed attention with limited - production minicars featuring styling odd enough to be cute
one is the <unk> a tiny coupe with a peelback canvas top and tilted headlights that give it a droopy - eyed look
<unk> initially planned to sell just n paos but sales have passed <unk> and there a one - year waiting list for the car
then there the <unk> - <unk> an offbeat delivery van with a snail - like body that inspired its name
<unk> helped develop a <unk> restaurant with both vehicles as its design theme
the chairs are <unk> - <unk> seats and a gift shop sells such items as alarm clocks styled like the <unk> oversized speedometer
all these vehicles have sharply improved <unk> morale and image but have n't done much for its market share
<unk> had n of the japanese car market in <unk> before beginning a depressing eight - year slide that continued through last year
strong sales so far this year are certain to turn the tide but even the n market share that <unk> expects in <unk> will leave it far below its position at the beginning of the decade
<unk> concedes that it wo n't recoup all its market - share losses in <unk> until at least <unk> and even that timetable might prove optimistic
everyone else is going to catch up with <unk> innovative designs says n a. <unk> <unk> auto analyst at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> pace of new - model hits will slow he adds n just as arch - rival <unk> unleashes its own batch of new cars
likewise in the <unk> <unk> has grabbed <unk> of the car market so far this year up from <unk> a year ago
but even that brings <unk> only to the share n it had in <unk> and leaves the company behind its high of <unk> in <unk> and <unk>
why
so far <unk> new - model successes are mostly specialized vehicles with limited sales potential
in compact and subcompact cars the bread - and-butter sales generators for japanese auto makers <unk> still trails <unk> and <unk>
<unk> hopes that that will start to change this fall with its new version of the <unk> compact sedan
the <unk> has been a nonentity compared with <unk> hugely successful <unk> and <unk> <unk>
but this year <unk> has revamped the <unk> and made it a midsized car
<unk> instead has kept its new <unk> a bit smaller than that and cut the base price n at <unk> <unk> prices start n below the predecessor model yet have a more - powerful engine
<unk> prices start at <unk>
<unk> risk is that its low - base-price strategy might get lost amid the highly publicized rebates being offered by <unk> <unk> three
but on a new car a rebate does n't work well because it cheapens the vehicle image contends n <unk> <unk> <unk> executive vice president of <unk> <unk> sales arm
even if the new <unk> succeeds <unk> will remain behind in the subcompact segment where its <unk> does n't measure up to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> will introduce a completely revamped <unk> next fall
at the opposite end of the market <unk> launches its luxury <unk> division on <unk> n three years after <unk> pioneered japanese luxury cars and two months after <unk> <unk> went on sale
<unk> started advertising <unk> fully eight months before the cars hit american showrooms
the ads featured fences rocks and pussy - willow buds almost anything but the cars themselves
the ads have generated some laughs but also plenty of attention because they are so unlike any other <unk> auto advertising
on the other hand <unk> sales goals for <unk> are modest compared with <unk> targets for <unk>
<unk> will build only about n of the <unk> <unk> n sedans each month sending about <unk> of them to the <unk> and keeping the rest for sale in <unk>
<unk> wants to sell about <unk> <unk> <unk> sedans next year in the <unk> alone
when i saw the <unk> sales projections i got worried confesses <unk> <unk> who led the <unk> development team
but on reflection <unk> <unk> says <unk> he concluded that <unk> is being prudent in following its slow - startup strategy instead of simply copying <unk>
<unk> is <unk> big business move for the <unk> century and we in no hurry to generate large profits right away <unk> <unk> says
despite plans to add two new <unk> models next year bringing the total to four <unk> wo n't show profits for at least five years he adds n
these days <unk> can afford that strategy even though profits are n't exactly robust
<unk> had record net income of n billion yen n million in the fiscal year ended last <unk> <unk> a remarkable recovery from the <unk> billion yen of two years earlier when the company lost money on operations
<unk> has increased earnings more than market share by cutting costs and by taking advantage of a general surge in japanese car sales
but <unk> expects to earn only n billion yen in the current fiscal year a modest increase of <unk>
the big reason for all its cost - cutting <unk> remains less efficient than <unk>
in its last fiscal year <unk> profit represented just n of sales compared with n at <unk>
to help close the gap <unk> recently established a top - level cost - cutting committee
<unk> is the world only auto maker currently building vehicles in all three of the world key economic arenas the <unk> <unk> and <unk>
that gives it an enviable strategic advantage at least until its rivals catch up but also plenty of managerial headaches
for example <unk> <unk> operations include <unk> separate subsidiaries for manufacturing sales design research etc . that report separately back to <unk>
and in <unk> <unk> <unk> manufacturing plant beat back a <unk> <unk> workers organizing effort with aggressive tactics that have left some workers bitter
we are in a transitional phase from being a japanese company to becoming an international company based in <unk> says <unk> <unk> the executive vice president
he promises that <unk> will soon establish a holding company overseeing all <unk> operations just as it doing in <unk>
perhaps the biggest challenge however will be to prevent a return to its former corporate rigidity as its recovery continues
already personnel officials are talking about the need for a <unk> two cultural - reform effort of some sort
we are still only half way through the turnaround of this company and there are many more things n to do <unk> <unk> says
he adds however that the momentum n we have generated is unstoppable
as expected <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> it agreed to form a recorded - music and music - publishing joint venture with former <unk> records <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> said <unk> it will provide financing for the venture but did n't disclose terms
<unk> <unk> has n't named the company yet but any records n it produces will be distributed by <unk>
<unk> is part of <unk> communications <unk> which is in the process of being acquired by <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> resigned as head of <unk> <unk> a unit of <unk> <unk> in <unk> and had been discussing a joint venture with both <unk> and <unk>
in a statement yesterday <unk> <unk> said n he chose <unk> the largest record company because their standing in the entertainment industry is second to none
<unk> <unk> and <unk> leader <unk> <unk> will hold an informal meeting in early <unk> a move that should give both leaders a political boost at home
the <unk> <unk> is purposely not calling the meeting a summit so that there wo n't be any expectation of detailed negotiations or agreements
rather senior administration officials said that the unexpected meeting was scheduled at <unk> <unk> request because of his preference for conducting diplomacy through highly personal and informal meetings with other leaders
the two leaders will meet on <unk> <unk> and <unk> alternating the two days of meetings between a <unk> and a soviet naval vessel in the <unk> <unk>
the unusual seaborne meeting wo n't disrupt plans for a formal summit meeting next spring or summer at which an arms - control treaty is likely to be completed
in announcing the meeting yesterday <unk> <unk> told reporters at the <unk> <unk> that neither he nor <unk> <unk> expects any substantial decisions or agreements
instead he said that the purpose is simply for the two to get better acquainted and discuss a wide range of issues without a formal agenda
despite the informal nature of the session and the calculated effort to hold down expectations the meeting could pay significant political dividends for both leaders
<unk> <unk> badly needs a diversion from the serious economic problems and ethnic unrest n he faces at home
american officials have said that a meeting with the leader of the <unk> could help bolster his stature among soviet politicians and academics whose support he needs
for his part <unk> <unk> has been criticized regularly at home for moving too slowly and cautiously in reacting to <unk> <unk> reforms and the historic moves away from communism in <unk> <unk>
a face - to-face meeting with <unk> <unk> should damp such criticism though it will hardly eliminate it
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who has been the most prominent democratic critic of <unk> <unk> handling of the soviet relationship praised the president for arranging the meeting
but he added the mere fact of a meeting does n't deal with the substance of policy
<unk> <unk> said that the <unk> meeting which was announced simultaneously in <unk> will be held in the unusual setting of ships at sea to hold down the fanfare and force the two sides to limit participation to just small groups of advisers
by doing it in this manner we can have i would say more time without the press of social activities or mandatory joint appearances things of that nature for public consumption <unk> <unk> said
soviet <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> at a news conference in <unk> said as the two sides plan to hold a full - scale summit in late spring - early summer next year they found it useful i would say even necessary to hold an interim informal meeting
although no specific agreements are expected <unk> <unk> said that does n't mean <unk> they will be without an agenda
if the two leaders cover the subjects that have been featured in lower level u.s.-soviet meetings their talks would include human rights soviet reforms regional disputes relations with allies economic cooperation arms control and joint efforts to fight narcotics terrorism and pollution
the president specifically mentioned <unk> economic advice to <unk> as a possible topic
<unk> <unk> has for months been publicly urging the <unk> to drop its restrictions on soviet trade
he recently told a small group of american businessmen in <unk> that he hoped to sign a general trade agreement with the <unk> possibly at the <unk> summit
the soviets hope <unk> a trade agreement would give them most - favored nation status which would lower the tariffs on soviet exports to the <unk>
in an unusually candid article about the latest economic woe unemployment <unk> yesterday reported that three million soviets have lost their jobs as a result of perestroika and the number could grow to n million by the year n
economists in <unk> are now proposing that the state start a system of unemployment benefits
but one <unk> administration official knowledgeable about the summit plan cautioned against assuming that there will be bold new initiatives on the soviet economy or other issues
do n't take this as some big opening for major movement on economic cooperation or arms control or the environment he said
those things will all come up but in a fairly informal way
instead this official said this is vintage <unk> <unk>
this was <unk> <unk> own idea
it <unk> <unk> wanting to meet a foreign leader and talk to him directly
aside from the soviet economic plight and talks on cutting strategic and chemical arms one other issue n the soviets are likely to want to raise is naval force reductions
western analysts say that given the meeting setting at sea <unk> is unlikely to pass up the opportunity to press once again for negotiated cuts in the navies of both the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk>
that theme has been a recurring one for soviet military officials for much of this year
they argue that as the <unk> follows through on announced plans to cut land forces the soviets area of greatest strength the <unk> should show more willingness to cut sea forces <unk> area of greatest superiority
one of the reasons <unk> <unk> administration aides are anxious to insist that the coming meeting will be informal is to avoid comparisons with the last such loosely structured superpower gathering former <unk> <unk> <unk> meeting with <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
that meeting sent shivers through the western alliance because <unk> <unk> was pulled into discussing the possible elimination of nuclear weapons without consulting american allies
<unk> <unk> said that he initiated talks with the soviets on the informal meeting by sending a proposal to <unk> <unk> last <unk> which the soviet leader readily accepted
but word of the possible session was closely held by the president and a handful of top aides and word of it did n't reach many second - level officials until the past few days
indeed many senior officials had been insisting for weeks that <unk> <unk> was n't interested in such an informal get - together
though <unk> <unk> political critics at home have been urging him to open a more direct dialogue with <unk> <unk> it actually was the arguments of leaders within the <unk> bloc itself that led the president to seek the <unk> meeting
<unk> <unk> decided n he wanted the meeting after talking in <unk> in <unk> with the leaders of <unk> and <unk> who urged him to support <unk> <unk> efforts to transform the soviet system and to urge him to loosen his grip on <unk> <unk> a senior aide said <unk>
while flying home from those discussions <unk> <unk> drafted a letter to <unk> <unk> suggesting an informal get - together n to precede their formal summit next year
<unk> <unk> in <unk> contributed to this article
<unk> <unk> del <unk> said <unk> its potential losses from lending to <unk> could reach <unk> trillion lire n million marking the bank first quantification of potential costs of unauthorized lending by its <unk> branch
<unk> previously reported that its <unk> branch had taken on loan commitments topping <unk> billion without the <unk> - based management approval
state - owned <unk> <unk> largest bank has filed charges against the branch former manager <unk> <unk> and a former branch vice president alleging fraud and breach of their fiduciary duties
<unk> also said that its board had approved after an in - depth discussion a letter to the <unk> of <unk> outlining measures <unk> the state - owned bank has taken or plans to take to improve controls on its foreign branches
the central bank had ordered <unk> to come up with a suitable program by yesterday
<unk> of <unk> has also ordered <unk> to shore up its capital base to account for potential foreign loan losses and the <unk> bank has outlined a n trillion lire capital - raising operation
<unk> was unable to elaborate on what measures were planned by the bank to improve controls on its branches abroad
hardly a day passes without news photos of the police dragging limp protesters from some building or thoroughfare in one of our cities
of recent note are the activities of the pro- and anti - abortionists anti - nuclear activists animal rights protesters college students concerned about racism anti - apartheid groups various self - styled environmentalists and those dissatisfied with the pace of the war against <unk>
maybe he did n't start it but <unk> <unk> certainly provided a recognizable beginning to non - violent civil disobedience as we know it today
the <unk> or great souled one instigated several campaigns of passive resistance against the british government in <unk>
unfortunately according to <unk> <unk> <unk> his policies went beyond his control and resulted in riots and disturbances and later a renewed campaign of civil disobedience resulted in rioting and a second imprisonment
i am not a proponent of everything <unk> <unk> did but some of his law breaking was justified because <unk> was then under occupation by a foreign power and indians were not able to participate fully in decisions that vitally affected them
it is difficult however to justify civil disobedience non - violent or not where citizens have full recourse to the ballot box to effect change
where truly representative governments are safeguarded by constitutional protections of human rights and an independent judiciary n to construe those rights there is no excuse for breaking the law because some individual or group disagrees with it
there may be a few cases where the law breaking is well pinpointed and so completely non - invasive of the rights of others that it is difficult to criticize it
the case of <unk> <unk> the black woman who refused to sit at the back of the bus comes to mind as an illustration
but most cases of non - violent civil disobedience are not nearly so benign
the public has a tendency to equate lawful demonstrations with non - violent civil disobedience
it is true that both are non - violent but there is a fundamental difference between them
lawful demonstrations such as peaceful picketing and other assemblages that do not disturb the peace or cause a public nuisance or interfere with the rights of others are rights guaranteed by any truly free system of government
civil disobedience violent or non - violent is intentional law breaking
the subject of this discussion is non - violent civil disobedience but before we get on with that let me make just a few tangential remarks about lawful demonstrations
they are useful to call public attention to grievances but they have little value in educating anyone about the issues in dispute
the delight of television in dramatic confrontation encourages overuse of slogans chanted through bullhorns militant gestures accusatory signs and other emotionally inspired tactics
civilized discourse and an environment where compromise can begin are lost in a hostile posture abetted by superficial media interviews
at best demonstrations are overused and boringly uninformative at worst they can become the stimuli that lead to law breaking
demonstrations are particularly apt to degenerate into criminal conduct when they leave the site of the grievance and become mobile
petty criminals and street people looking for excitement attach themselves like remora to the fringes of the crowd and use the protest as an excuse for rock throwing auto trashing arson window breaking looting pocket picking and general hooliganism
soon the whole purpose of the demonstration is lost in mob mania
there are better ways n to promote a cause
where non - violent civil disobedience is the centerpiece rather than a lawful demonstration that may only attract crime it is difficult n to justify
some find no harm in the misdemeanors of trespass minor property destruction blocking traffic and the like
they say n these are small prices <unk> to pay for galvanizing action for the all - important cause
the crimes may appear small but the prices can be huge
here are two cases n to illustrate
assume a neighborhood demonstration n to protest speeding on a certain road or a careless accident involving a police car
the protesters lie down in the street blocking traffic and will not move until the authorities carry them away
assume that someone caught in the jam has a heart attack
there is no way n to get an ambulance in quickly to move him to a hospital
he dies
the demonstration was non - violent and involved only a simple misdemeanor but its impact on that individual was violent and terminal
assume that a tv network is airing a celebrity interview program with a live audience
the politician appearing is highly controversial and has recently generated a good deal of rancor amid certain groups
in a planned protest against his appearance several members of the studio audience chain themselves in front of the tv cameras in such a way that the program can not continue
the network must refund money to the advertisers and loses considerable revenue and prestige
the demonstrators have been non - violent but the result of their trespasses has been to seriously impair the rights of others unconnected with their dispute
it might be alleged that tv has done more than its share to popularize and promote non - violent civil disobedience so the second situation hypothesized above would be simply a case of chickens coming home to roost
or maybe the tv network would lose nothing
<unk> or <unk> would probably pull up another camera and interview the chained protesters
let us look for a moment at another type of non - violent civil disobedience that only harms other people indirectly yet does irreparable damage to the nation as a whole
i am referring to those young men who chose to disobey their country call to arms during the <unk> war and fled to <unk> or some other sanctuary to avoid combat
their cowardly acts of civil disobedience which they tried to hide under the cloak of outrage at a war <unk> they characterized as immoral weakened the national fabric and threw additional burdens on those who served honorably in that conflict
even more at fault are those leaders in and out of government who urged and supported their defections thereby giving great help and comfort to the enemy propagandists
it is amazing that the ensuing mass executions in <unk> and <unk> do not weight more heavily on minds so morally fine - tuned
worse it remained to a well - meaning but naive president of the <unk> <unk> to administer the final infamy upon those who fought and died in <unk>
under the guise of healing the wounds of the nation <unk> <unk> pardoned thousands of draft evaders thus giving dignity to their allegations of the war immorality
the precedent having been set who can complain if future generations called upon to defend the <unk> yield to the temptation to avoid the danger of combat by simply declaring the war immoral and hiding until it is over
finally i think n it important to point out the extraordinarily high visibility of non - violent civil disobedience in these days of intensive media coverage
give television a chance to cover live any breaking of the law and no second invitation will be required
this brings into question the motives of those who lead civil disobedience demonstrations
do they want the spotlight for themselves or for their cause
here is a good rule of thumb if the movement produced the leader the chance that he is sincere is much greater than if the leader produced the movement
in either case ask yourself whether you have become better informed on the issues under protest by watching the act of civil disobedience
if you have not it is probable that a thorough airing of the dispute by calm and rational debate would have been the better course
<unk> <unk> was vice president of the <unk> from <unk> until he resigned in <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> and key legislators agreed to back a temporary one - quarter-cent increase in the state sales tax to raise n million for repairs and relief associated with last month earthquake
the tax increase which will be considered at a special session of the state legislature that begins tomorrow would cover only part of the estimated n billion to <unk> billion in total damage caused by the <unk> <unk> quake
aside from as much as n billion in recently approved federal aid the state is expected to draw from a gubernatorial emergency fund that currently stands at an estimated n million

rewards have been suggested but never adopted for filers who come through <unk> audits without change
penalty overhaul is still likely congressional sources say n
long - debated proposals to simplify the more than n civil penalties and make them fairer and easier n to administer are in the <unk> tax bill

still congressional aides say n penalty reform is a strong candidate for enactment even if not this time around although some provisions may be modified
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a leader on the issue who generally backs the <unk> plan wants some changes for one separate sanctions for negligence and large misstatements of tax owed not a single penalty

taxpayers rights are defined by a growing number of states
the <unk> tax act created a federal bill of rights spelling out <unk> duties to protect taxpayers rights in the assessment and collection of taxes
states are following suit
<unk> enacted a rights law in <unk>
in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> have adopted rights laws the <unk> of <unk> administrators a state officials group reports n the features vary

one group is the <unk> on <unk> <unk> which comprises <unk> multistate corporations and advises the <unk> of <unk> chambers of <unk>
the group <unk> <unk> says <unk> its efforts begun in <unk> have led to the introduction of bills in <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to establish evenhanded procedures affecting all kinds of taxpayers

all <unk> previous court efforts to head off the pilots demands have failed
an <unk> spokesman said n he does n't expect that the arbitrator ruling will have any overall material effect on the company strategic plan
bankruptcy experts said n the law is n't clear on how such an arbitration ruling can affect a company case
like any other creditor the pilots will have to apply to the court for payment of their claim
that may leave a lot of leeway <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to decide what if anything the pilots actually collect
in <unk> he issued the ruling that let the pilots pursue their back - pay grievance before the arbitrator
the pilots contract with <unk> calls for a mutually acceptable private arbitrator to resolve such grievances
in a statement to employees <unk> said n the company was disappointed by the ruling
the obligation is totally unwarranted the statement said
<unk> <unk> a lawyer for the <unk> <unk> pilots <unk> said <unk> the pilots were extremely pleased
this is a blow not only to <unk> but to the creditors committee he said
<unk> creditors committee along with the company has consistently opposed the pilots claim which if paid would have to come out of money n both hope to use to pay off other bankruptcy claims
<unk> and its creditors are in the final delicate stages of negotiating a second reorganization plan to pay off the airline debts
an earlier plan which had received the creditors approval in <unk> fell apart when <unk> changed its business plan
it is n't known whether the pilot claim was figured into either plan
the dispute between <unk> and its pilots is over a pay parity clause in the pilots contract
the clause was part of an agreement in which pilots accepted a substantial pay cut as long as no other labor group got a raise
shortly after <unk> <unk> took control of <unk> some machinists union supervisors received a <unk> pay raise
the pilots argued that this triggered a pay raise for them
<unk> has disputed the claim but a federal district court an appeals court and now the arbitrator have all sided with the pilots
the two sides do n't even agree about how much money is at issue
the pilots put the amount as high as n million the company at n million
another arbitrator is hearing another pay parity case between <unk> and its pilots resulting from a similar set of circumstances involving a separate pay raise granted another union

at <unk> <unk> he will work with clients and potential clients on marketing strategies aside from agency compensation issues he helped <unk> for example come up with its positioning and pricing for its new <unk> line
his client contacts meanwhile could prove a gold mine for an agency that has had few new business wins of late
i done over <unk> ad agency searches for clients so i have a pretty good notion of what clients are interested in when they look for an agency <unk> <unk> said

he spent most of his career formulating marketing strategies but became best - known for chipping away at ad agency compensation
ad agencies typically earned a straight n commission if a client spent n million on tv time the agency made n million
but <unk> <unk> pioneered negotiated fees which often worked out to less than n
more recently he negotiated indemnification clauses in which an ad agency in some cases must pay a client if it drops the account
he ultimately became so well - known for cutting compensation however that clients did n't seek him out for anything else
i was very frustrated he said
the fact of the matter is <unk> i am a marketer
that another reason for the <unk> <unk> job
it struck me as a way n to get back to what i really want to do
<unk> <unk> added pointedly the pressure on commissions did n't begin with <unk> <unk>

<unk> <unk> helped <unk> in its recent agency search and he has a long relationship with <unk> which is having severe troubles including declining sales

the <unk> <unk> <unk> recently spent an hour discussing the state of <unk> and the world with two <unk> reporters in his plainly furnished wood - paneled office
the interview did not touch on <unk> domestic affairs
skipping personal pleasantries <unk> <unk> picked up exactly where he left off several months earlier before the government crackdown in <unk> when he had warned that the orthodox leadership in <unk> feared a plurality of views
excerpts follow
on <unk> turmoil it is a very unhappy scene he said
it took <unk> <unk> former premier and party chief n years to build a team of economists who understood how the western economies work and now that team is part in exile part being rusticated and part missing
rebuilding that team <unk> <unk> predicted <unk> will take another n years
that very sad for <unk> and for <unk> because <unk> could have been a good engine for growth not just for <unk> <unk> and <unk> but for <unk> <unk> and the rest of <unk>
on similarities between <unk> and the <unk> <unk> in important particulars the soviets are different from the chinese
they are already industrialized
their problem is one of inefficiency of an industrial economy
the chinese problem is much greater it how to industrialize to begin with
asked if the soviets like chinese officials wo n't one day face a similar conflict between the desire to liberalize economically and yet retain political control <unk> <unk> said i would think that the soviets face a deeper dilemma because they have been more in blinkers than the chinese i mean keeping their people cut off from the outside world
<unk> <unk> he said n is ahead of <unk> leaders in his awareness of the world
but i think n the soviet peoples are more introverted than the chinese
regardless he said he still believes n the <unk> <unk> while falling far short of the efficiency of a western economy may well manage to improve considerably
on <unk> - <unk> prosperity if <unk> can keep up the present situation her markets open for another <unk> years with adjustments and <unk> can grow and not cut back and so too <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> then in n years the economies of these countries would be totally restructured to be able to almost sustain growth by themselves
in such an arrangement all benefit he said n
and if the europeans come in they benefit too
it not a zero - sum game
asked about the possibility of greater economic cooperation among <unk> - <unk> nations which will be discussed <unk> <unk> and <unk> at a ministerial meeting in <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> the goal is to have a free and open world trading system
an asian bloc is n't intended he said n
that not possible
on u.s.-japan relations i encouraged
i think n the earlier strident notes struck by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> have been more rounded
i believe <unk> the <unk> is becoming more patient and circumspect he said
it the total relationship that is important
the total relationship as <unk> <unk> sees it is the flow of dollars to the <unk> <unk> to fund the deficits the investments n the japanese are making in the <unk> in order to satisfy american demand that american products consumed in <unk> should be made as much as possible in <unk> by americans with japanese technology and capital
<unk> recent political turbulence <unk> <unk> said <unk> may mean <unk> <unk> will slow market adjustments
they be more timorous in tackling their own voters like opening up more to agricultural imports from <unk> hurting their farmers
on <unk> military presence in <unk> <unk> if his offer to allow the american military to use facilities in <unk> would help preserve <unk> presence in the region at bases in the <unk> he said what we have done is make it easier for the philippines to continue to host american bases without it being said n they are lackeys of the imperialists and the only ones in <unk> or in <unk> <unk>
we are willing to share the political burden of being host to <unk> an imperial power
we think n it is n't such a great burden that it carries no stigma and we are prepared to do it
on u.s.-philippine relations it such a mixed - up relationship going back into history
i really do not understand how it is that filipinos feel so passionately involved in this father figure that they want to dispose of and yet they need
i just do n't understand it
my relationships with the british are totally different
they lorded it over me
they did me some good
they did themselves even more good
they let me down when the japanese came down during <unk> <unk> <unk>
i do n't feel down or done in because i show british serials on my television network or read their books
i mean <unk> it is a normal adult relationship
but the filipinos and the americans when i talk to them there so much passion about filipino manhood being diminished as a result of being squatted upon by the americans and so on
the occasional <unk> tries to put on airs but we let it pass
it just comic when they try to pretend n they still the master race
<unk> <unk> added that the filipinos are making it very difficult for the <unk> military presence to last beyond five or n years
on military alternatives if the <unk> pulls back the soviets already are present
i suppose <unk> sooner or later the japanese would have to fill up a large part of the gap on the naval side
maybe the chinese maybe even the indians
on economic consequences of a diminished <unk> presence <unk> is the only major power in recent history that has used its military might to sustain a system that enables all participants to equally benefit without her as the provider of the security taking royalties
asked why so few nations seem to share his views of <unk> he said many people see it that way
but they have just taken it for granted
on <unk> <unk> assume that former cambodian leader <unk> <unk> <unk> does what the press wants him to do and joins up with <unk> - backed cambodian leader <unk> <unk>
is the trouble over
can <unk> and <unk> <unk> knock off the <unk> <unk> still supported by <unk>
he ca n't
what is the way forward
to get the <unk> <unk> as part of a process for elections
and when they lose then we can expect <unk> to stop aid
let put it bluntly
the chinese can not be seen to have made use of the <unk> <unk> and then discard them
<unk> <unk> is vice president of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is editor of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
everything looked good as neurosurgeon <unk> <unk> and colleagues carefully cut away a woman spinal tumor at the <unk> <unk> in <unk>
using small electrical shocks applied to her feet they were able to monitor sensory nerves
the shocks generated nerve impulses that traveled via spine to brain and showed up clearly on a brain - wave monitor indicating no damage to the delicate spinal tissue
then says <unk> <unk> she woke up paralyzed
the damage was to her motor nerves which could n't be monitored along with the sensory nerves he explains n
the tragedy he adds <unk> galvanized me to look for a way n to prevent similar cases
<unk> <unk> answer may come with a new kind of magnetic brain probe a device that he and dozens of <unk> researchers are studying with great hope
besides holding the promise of safer spinal surgery the probe could improve the diagnosis of brain and nerve disorders such as strokes and multiple sclerosis
perhaps most exciting the device is thrusting open a window to the workings of the brain
the probe which is painless non - invasive and apparently harmless employs strong magnetic fields to induce small whirlwinds of electricity within the brain
if positioned over the brain motor - control area the hand - held electromagnets generate nerve impulses that zip down motor nerves and activate muscles making say a finger twitch
in principle they will enable doctors to check the body motor system the way n an electrician tests a home electrical circuits by running current through them
until now we had no objective way of measuring motor function says <unk> <unk> a neurologist conducting clinical tests with the devices at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
all n we could do was tell a patient squeeze my fingers as hard as you can or raise your arm
under the best circumstances such tests are subjective when a patient is unconscious they do n't work at all
magnetic brain tweaking started in the early n when researchers produced flashes of light in the visual field with magnets
in the <unk> <unk> <unk> researchers developed magnetic devices n to stimulate motor nerves in the hand and other limbs
but for brain tests the unwieldy machines would have required patients to stand on their heads says <unk> <unk> <unk> a researcher at the <unk> of <unk> at <unk> <unk>
the field took off in <unk> after scientists at <unk> <unk> <unk> developed a handy compact magnet for brain stimulation
since then at least two commercial versions have been put on the <unk> market and an estimated n have been sold
in <unk> a <unk> conference on such devices attracted more than <unk> researchers who reported studies on everything from brain mapping to physical therapy
we do n't feel n we can use the devices routinely in surgery yet but we getting close says <unk> <unk> who is now with the <unk> of <unk>
a problem he adds n is that anesthetized brains are more resistant to magnetic stimulation than awake ones
the devices could help indicate when surgery would help says <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> of <unk> neurosurgeon
for example paralyzed car - crash victims occasionally have some intact spinal tissues that if preserved by emergency surgery enable partial recovery
but such operations typically are n't performed because there is no sign right after an injury that surgery would be beneficial
the cost of magnetic stimulators would seem like peanuts if we could retrieve limb function in such people <unk> <unk> says <unk>
scientists caution n there is a chance n the magnet technique might spark seizures in epileptics
but no significant problems have been reported among hundreds of people tested with the devices
the main sensation besides feeling like a puppet jerked with invisible strings is like a rap on the head says <unk> <unk> bridgers a neurologist who has studied the brain stimulators at <unk> <unk>
one apparent side effect is a minor increase in a brain hormone
and some doctors who have conducted hours of tests on themselves report temporary headaches
at least two companies <unk> laboratories <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> systems <unk> of <unk> <unk> now sell versions of the magnetic devices
the machines which at n are inexpensive by medical standards have n't been approved in the <unk> for marketing as brain stimulators but are sold for stimulating nerves in the hand legs and other non - brain areas
researchers can apply for permission to use the probes for brain studies
at the <unk> of <unk> a team led by <unk> <unk> a physical therapy researcher is testing the stimulators in conjunction with electric shocks to induce muscle contractions to help prevent wasting of thigh muscles after knee surgery
similarly a <unk> <unk> team led by heart researcher <unk> <unk> hopes to develop ways <unk> to magnetically induce cardiac muscle contractions
the devices might someday serve as temporary pacemakers or restarters for stopped hearts says <unk> <unk> <unk> whose prototype was dubbed the <unk> whacker
the devices most remarkable possibilities though involve the brain
probing with the stimulators <unk> institutes of <unk> scientists recently showed how the brain reorganizes motor - control resources after an amputation
similar studies are expected to reveal how stroke patients brains regroup a first step toward finding ways n to bolster that process and speed rehabilitation
scientists also are exploring memory and perception with the new machines
at the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> at <unk> researchers flash two groups of different letters on a computer screen in front of human guinea pigs
between flashes certain areas in subjects brains are jolted with a magnetic stimulator
when the jolt is timed just right the subjects do n't recall seeing the first group of letters
where does that first stimulus go exclaims <unk> neurologist <unk> <unk>
trying to answer that is suggesting all kinds of theories such as precisely where and how the brain processes incoming signals from the eyes
he and others say that the machines are weak enough that they do n't jeopardize the memory
both the <unk> team and researchers at the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> are working with more potent magnetic brain stimulators
among other things the stronger devices may be able to summon forth half - forgotten memories and induce mood changes neurologists say n
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> - <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said n they signed a three - year n million agreement to collaborate on superconductor research
the collaboration will include at least n researchers and will be aimed primarily at developing thin films of high - temperature superconductors for use in electronics the companies said <unk>
the materials discovered during the past three years conduct electricity without resistance and promise smaller faster computers and other new technologies
joint - research programs have proliferated as <unk> companies seek to spread the risks and costs of commercializing new superconductors and to meet the challenges posed by foreign consortia especially in <unk>
the latest research pact bolsters <unk> <unk> growing portfolio of investments in superconductors
the <unk> <unk> chemicals concern previously signed research superconductor agreements with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and with <unk> <unk> <unk>
last year <unk> <unk> agreed to pay n million for rights to superconductor work at the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> - <unk> is a <unk> <unk> <unk> computer maker
the <unk> <unk> laboratory is one of three <unk> <unk> of <unk> national laboratories designed as pilot centers to foster joint industry - government programs n to speed the transfer of new superconductors to the marketplace
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> it issued n million of securities backed by credit - card receivables
the offering was priced with an n coupon rate at n to yield n
the retailer said <unk> the securities are expected to be rated triple - a by <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> by <unk> investors <unk> <unk>
they pay interest only for n months with principal payments beginning thereafter
the expected average life of the certificates is n years with the final scheduled payment in <unk> n
<unk> <unk> <unk> is sole underwriter
as part of the transaction <unk> <unk> will sell a portion of its credit - card receivables to its <unk> receivables <unk> unit which will then transfer them to a master trust
the trust will issue the certificates
credit support will be provided by a letter of credit facility from <unk> <unk> in favor of the trustee <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for the benefit of the certificate holders
<unk> <unk> will continue to service the receivables
battle - tested japanese industrial managers here always buck up nervous newcomers with the tale of the first of their countrymen n to visit <unk> a boatload of samurai warriors blown ashore n years ago
from the beginning it took a man with extraordinary qualities to succeed in <unk> says <unk> <unk> president of <unk> group <unk> <unk> <unk> unit
here in this new center for japanese assembly plants just across the border from <unk> <unk> turnover is dizzying infrastructure shoddy bureaucracy intense
even after - hours drag karaoke bars where japanese revelers sing over recorded music are prohibited by <unk> powerful musicians union
still n japanese companies including giants such as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> have set up shop in the state of <unk> <unk> <unk>
keeping the japanese happy will be one of the most important tasks facing conservative leader <unk> <unk> when he takes office <unk> n as the first opposition governor in <unk> modern history
<unk> with its desperate need for investment and <unk> with its huge budget surplus would seem like a perfect match
but the two countries remain separated by a cultural barrier wider than the ocean
conservative japanese investors are put off by what they consider <unk> restrictive investment regulations and loose work habits
from the mexicans viewpoint vaunted tactics of methodical japanese managers do n't count for much in a land where a saying says there are no fixed rules
<unk> ranks as only the fourth largest foreign investor in <unk> with n of the total investments
that is just n of all the money <unk> <unk> has invested abroad
mexican <unk> <unk> <unk> de <unk> would like to change that
the young president so admires japanese discipline that he sends his children to a japanese school in <unk> <unk>
he already has finagled a <unk> billion loan from the japanese government
but <unk> urgently needs more help
<unk> <unk> unpopular <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> faces congressional elections in <unk>
for the <unk> to stand a chance <unk> <unk> has to press on with an economic program that so far has succeeded in lowering inflation and providing moderate economic growth
but maintaining the key components of his strategy a stable exchange rate and high level of imports will consume enormous amounts of foreign exchange
<unk> <unk> needs big investment inflows quickly
the problem is that japanese businesses make decisions with a view well beyond the coming months that weigh so heavily on <unk> <unk>
the japanese will come to <unk> but not immediately says <unk> <unk> director - general of the japanese <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>
if not now when
when the fruit is ripe it falls from the tree by itself he says
pressed on the matter he is more specific
there will be big japanese investments probably five to n years from now
<unk> <unk> <unk> ambassador to <unk> agrees that <unk> may be too eager
there seems to be a presumption in some sectors of <unk> government that there is a lot of japanese money waiting behind the gate and that by slightly opening the gate that money will enter <unk>
i do n't think n that is the case
mexican officials maintain n the japanese reserve is only a result of unfamiliarity
because of distance it takes a while for them to appreciate the economic stability n we achieved says one economic policymaker
<unk> is sending a number of missions to <unk> looking for a major breakthrough investment in telecommunications petrochemicals or tourism
it is hoped that other japanese would then follow the leader
but japanese investors say that their reluctance to invest stems not only from concerns about <unk> economic outlook but also reservations about <unk> recently revamped investment law
unable to get a new law through a congress with a strong leftist bloc <unk> jury - rigged the existing law regulations
it created special n trusts to allow foreigners n ownership in some once - closed industries
it also made artful use of semantics redefining as non - strategic industries some that had been in the national domain
those devices do n't give sufficient certainty to our bosses in <unk> says <unk> <unk> representative of the <unk> <unk> of <unk>
<unk> <unk> cites the case of a customer who wants to build a giant tourism complex in <unk> and has been trying for eight years to get around <unk> restrictions on foreign ownership of beachfront property
he could develop the beach through a trust but instead is trying have his grandson become a naturalized <unk> so his family gains direct control
some say <unk> the best hope for the mexicans is catching the eye of <unk> by promoting the one industry n the japanese clearly like the border assembly plants known as maquiladoras which are open to <unk> foreign control
we must do more to help the japanese here in <unk> if we want them to invest elsewhere says <unk> <unk> the governor - elect of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and himself a succesful businessman
plant operators are heartened by <unk> <unk> pledge to cut corruption associated with the ruling party officials
but <unk> <unk> frets that an even bigger problem could be protectionism from the <unk> where some politicians oppose what they consider japanese efforts to use maquiladoras to crack the <unk> market through the back door
shaken by tumbling stock prices and pessimistic projections of <unk> economic growth currency analysts around the world have toned down their assessments of the dollar near - term performance
most of the n analysts polled last week by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> expect the <unk> dollar to ease only mildly in <unk>
opinion is mixed over its three - month prospects
half of those polled see the currency trending lower over the next three months while the others forecast a modest rebound after the <unk> <unk>
in late afternoon <unk> <unk> trading yesterday the dollar stood at <unk> <unk> german marks up from <unk> marks late <unk> and at <unk> yen up from <unk> yen late <unk>
a month ago a similar survey predicted <unk> the dollar would be trading at n marks and n yen by the end of <unk>
sterling was trading at <unk> down from <unk> late <unk>
in <unk> <unk> the <unk> currency was trading at about <unk> yen at midmorning up from <unk> yen at the opening and up from <unk> <unk> close of <unk> yen
the average of estimates of the n economists polled puts the dollar around <unk> marks at the end of <unk> and at n yen
by late <unk> the consensus calls for the dollar to be trading around <unk> marks and near n yen
those with a bullish view see the dollar trading up near n marks and n yen while the dollar bears see the <unk> currency trading around <unk> marks and n yen
a number of those polled predict <unk> the dollar will slip as the <unk> <unk> eases interest rates
<unk> <unk> an economist at <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> said n he expects further cuts in short - term <unk> rates in an effort to encourage a narrowing of the trade gap and to ensure a soft landing in the <unk> economy
<unk> <unk> a vice president and manager of corporate trade at <unk> <unk> of <unk> agreed with that view and predicted <unk> the <unk> federal funds rate will drop to between <unk> <unk> and <unk> within <unk> days from its current level at <unk> <unk>
<unk> funds is the rate n banks charge each other on overnight loans the <unk> influences the rate by adding or draining reserves from the banking system
<unk> <unk> also predicted a half - point cut in the <unk> discount rate in the near future
the discount rate currently n is the rate <unk> the <unk> charges member banks for loans using government securities as collateral
he expects such a cut because of problems in several sectors of the economy particularly real estate and automobiles
bolstering his argument the <unk> <unk> reported yesterday that new home sales for <unk> were down n from <unk> revised n fall
the drop marked the largest monthly tumble since a <unk> slide in <unk> n
in last month survey a number of currency analysts predicted n the dollar would be pressured by a narrowing of interest rate differentials between the <unk> and <unk> <unk>
indeed in early <unk> the west german central bank raised its discount and <unk> rates by a full percentage point
several other european central banks notably in <unk> followed the west german <unk> lead by raising their own key rates
and a week later <unk> raised its official discount rate by a half point to <unk>
the japanese discount rate is the central bank base rate on loans to commercial banks
after a surprisingly sharp widening in the <unk> <unk> merchandise trade deficit n billion from a revised n billion in <unk> and well above expectations and a startling n drop in stock prices on <unk> n the <unk> <unk> relaxed short - term interest rates knocking fed funds from around <unk> to <unk> <unk>
but predictions that central banks of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> major industrial nations would continue their massive dollar sales went astray as the market drove the dollar downward on its own reacting to <unk> <unk> plunge and subsequent price volatility lower <unk> interest rates and signs of a slowing <unk> economy
n consists of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
<unk> <unk> senior deputy manager in the treasury department of <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> suggested that uncertainty about <unk> stocks and bonds has made japanese investors leery of holding those securities in the near term thus damping dollar demand
but <unk> <unk> added <unk> once <unk> equities regain some stability players will move back into dollar - denominated investments especially <unk> bonds whose value rises when interest rates decline
<unk> <unk> said <unk> the key dollar - yen exchange rate is at n yen
if <unk> is broken some panic will be seen he predicted explaining that japanese institutions are comfortable with the dollar anywhere between current levels and n yen
<unk> - <unk> <unk> a senior trader at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> said n he expects the dollar to recover within the next three months to around <unk> marks as <unk> economic data particularly <unk> trade figures level off
he contended that the <unk> wo n't ease rates further but predicted <unk> <unk> officials will relax key rates in <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> chief trader at <unk> of <unk> in <unk> took an opposite stance
he said <unk> he expects <unk> interest rates to decline dragging the dollar down to around <unk> marks by the end of <unk> after a short - lived dash to n marks by the end of <unk>
west german interest rates he said <unk> will remain unchanged
but i not one of these great dollar bears n you see more of these days <unk> <unk> said
i ca n't really see it dropping far below n marks
<unk> <unk> chief foreign exchange dealer with <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> fits the description of a great dollar bear
he predicted <unk> the <unk> unit will skid below <unk> marks to around <unk> marks this month and n marks by the beginning of the new year
we finally seeing the culmination of all the recessionary buildup of the last few months he said noting n a continuing downward trend in <unk> interest rates a shaky stock market and gloomier economic times ahead all signal a significantly lower dollar
in the wake of <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> surprise resignation and sterling subsequent nose - dive most analysts had little good n to say about the pound near - term prospects
<unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> suggested that the new chancellor <unk> <unk> will take a tough line in his autumn statement later this month helping to underpin the pound
but he warned n the currency will remain at risk
on the <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> gold for current delivery dropped <unk> to n an ounce in moderate trading

in early trading in <unk> <unk> <unk> gold was quoted at n an ounce
<unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> contributed to this article
<unk> <unk> will repeal the unpopular turnover tax on securities transactions as of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk>
he said n the government will also repeal the <unk> transaction tax on the first - time purchase of stakes in companies
the announcement follows several comments by government officials that the government will speed up the repeal of the tax which was originally scheduled to fall with the start of the single internal market in the <unk> <unk> at the end of <unk>
the securities - turnover tax has been long criticized by the west german financial community because it tends to drive securities trading and other banking activities out of <unk> into rival financial centers especially <unk> where trading transactions is n't taxed
the tax has raised less than one billion marks n million annually in recent years but the government has been reluctant to abolish the levy for budgetary concerns
in the interview <unk> <unk> did n't specify the amount of revenue <unk> the government will lose after the tax disappears
the new date means that the tax will be officially repealed before the end of the current parliamentary term at the end of <unk> and guarantees its abolition even if the current center - right coalition loses the elections in <unk> n
earlier this year <unk> <unk> made a final take - it-or-leave it offer on the minimum wage an increase to n an hour over three years and only if accompanied by a lower wage for the first six months of a job
now the <unk> <unk> has decided to accept the higher wage over only two years
the sub - minimum wage would apply only to first - time teen - age workers for <unk> days
the <unk> <unk> had enough votes to sustain a veto but chose to avoid a confrontation
the only permanent losers will be the <unk> or so workers n everyone agrees n will be priced out of a job at the <unk> rate <unk> <unk> is likely to approve today
it is compromises such as this that convince <unk> liberals that if they simply stay the course this administration will stray from its own course on this and other issues
the head trader of <unk> <unk> <unk> interest - rate options group has left the company following valuation errors that resulted in a n million charge against its third - quarter results
<unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> resigned recently but one individual close to the situation said <unk> the resignation was forced
<unk> <unk> could n't be reached for comment
a separate inquiry by <unk> cleared <unk> <unk> of allegations that he had been lavishly entertained by a <unk> <unk> money broker
that inquiry has n't resolved similar allegations involving another <unk> options trader
in other personnel changes stemming from problems in its options unit
<unk> named <unk> <unk> a trader in swaps contracts for the bank to assume <unk> <unk> duties and to be trading manager for derivative products including swaps and interest - rate options
<unk> <unk> vice president in charge of options research who discovered the valuation errors and was asked by senior management to straighten out the mess resigned to take a position in asset and liability management at <unk> <unk> in <unk>
<unk> <unk> whom <unk> tried to keep did n't return calls for comment
separately <unk> confirmed that it took an undisclosed charge in the second quarter for losses on forward - rate agreements involving foreign currency written by its branch in <unk> <unk> <unk>
a <unk> spokeswoman said n the second - quarter charge was not material and that no personnel changes were made as a result
the spokeswoman said <unk> the <unk> situation was totally different from problems in the interest - rate options unit
according to individuals familiar with the situation the <unk> loss stemmed from a computer program for calculating prices on forward - rate agreements that failed to envision an interest - rate environment where short - term rates were equal to or higher than long - term rates
while the incidents involving interest - rate options and forward - rate agreements are unrelated some observers say n they echo a <unk> incident in which <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> restated the value of its foreign exchange options contracts downward by about n million
these complex products require close monitoring because each must be valued separately in light of current market conditions
in an interest - rate options contract a client pays a fee to a bank for custom - tailored protection against adverse interest - rate swings for a specified period
in a forward - rate agreement a client agrees to an exchange rate on a future currency transaction
some competitors maintain n the interestrate option loss in particular may have resulted more from <unk> taking large and often contrarian positions than a valuation problem
started three years ago <unk> interest - rate options group was a leading force in the field
from <unk> to n the value of <unk> option contracts outstanding mushroomed to n billion from n billion
more importantly the volume of options written exceeded those purchased by almost n
with such a lopsided book of options traders say <unk> <unk> was more vulnerable to erroneous valuation assumptions
the <unk> spokeswoman said n the bank has examined its methodologies and internal controls
we consider our internal controls to have worked well she said adding that some procedures have been strengthened
its valuation methodologies she said n are recognized as some of the best on the street
not a lot was needed to be done
when <unk> <unk> <unk> went big league last year he acquired a treasure - trove of <unk> along with a well - known but ailing security business <unk> <unk>
there was a wanted poster offering <unk> for the arrest of <unk> and <unk> robbers <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and the original <unk> logo with an open eye and the inscription we never sleep which inspired the phrase private eye
then there were two gold watches once owned by <unk> <unk> who founded the company in <unk> in <unk>
but there were supposed to be three <unk> <unk> company claims n
the missing watch is emblematic of the problems <unk> <unk> <unk> encountered in building his closely held <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> into the largest detective and security agency in the <unk> through acquisitions
the ever - optimistic <unk> <unk> has learned that while acquiring a big brand - name company can be a shortcut to growth it can also bring a host of unforeseen problems
we cleared out a lot of rats nests says the n security veteran
<unk> <unk> who started his career as an <unk> <unk> investigator and worked as a security officer for several large companies built his <unk> <unk> <unk> from a tiny mom - and-pop security patrol firm here in the <unk> <unk> <unk>
he joined the firm in <unk> and bought it from the owners the next year
over the next <unk> years <unk> <unk> <unk> opened <unk> offices around the country
yet although <unk> <unk> <unk> was netting bigger and bigger clients the firm provided security for the <unk> <unk> olympics in <unk> <unk> it still did n't have the name recognition of <unk>
so when <unk> <unk> <unk> decided to sell the unit in <unk> as part of a divestiture of its food and security industries operations <unk> <unk> saw a chance to accomplish several objectives
he decided n he could easily merge <unk> operations with his own while slashing overhead costs because the two already operated in many of the same cities
he could acquire a staff of loyal <unk> employees many of whom had spent their entire careers with the firm he could eliminate a competitor and he could get the name recognition n he wanted
<unk> <unk> also relished the chance to demonstrate n an entrepreneur like himself who spent his whole career in the security business could run <unk> better than an unfocused conglomerate or investment banker
the security business is my favorite subject
i love this business he says
most of the <unk> guys do n't know how to run a business anyway
but there were hitches not the least of which was that <unk> <unk> says he proceeded almost blindly in doing the n million acquisition which was completed in <unk> n
we were n't allowed to do any due diligence because of competitive reasons
if we had it might have scared us off he says
five years of rapid expansion under <unk> <unk> with an emphasis on marketing the agency services instead of improving them had hurt <unk> profits <unk> <unk> claims n
he says <unk> his team could n't tell whether accounts receivable had been paid or not
<unk> had locked itself into low - price contracts to win new business with no hope of profitability until the contracts expired he adds n
and regional offices were egregiously overstaffed he claims n
one office had n people doing the work of three and half of the employees had company automobiles
<unk> <unk> declined to comment on <unk> <unk> accusations
the acquisition combined the country second - largest security company <unk> with n sales of n million and the fourth largest <unk> <unk> <unk> with n million in sales creating the industry biggest firm which took on the <unk> name
even after divesting itself of n million of unprofitable business the new <unk> will have sales of about n million this year and operating profit roughly double the industry average of n of sales says <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> which arranged the <unk> acquisition
<unk> <unk> says <unk> his turnaround strategy has been simple just hack away at the fat
he began by closing n of the combined companies <unk> offices in two months eliminating about <unk> of the company n adminstrative staff including more than n sales positions
he shut down the company tony <unk> <unk> headquarters
<unk> world headquarters today is a nondescript two - story office building across the street from the small <unk> <unk> <unk>
next <unk> <unk> raised <unk> rates which were n lower than <unk> <unk> <unk> average rate of around <unk>
and he got rid of low - margin businesses that just were n't making money for the company
<unk> <unk> who says <unk> <unk> had a loss of nearly n million in n under <unk> <unk> boasts that he made <unk> profitable again
but <unk> <unk> team still must pay down about n million of long - term bank debt from the acquisition within the next four years
last year earnings of the combined companies did n't cover debt service and <unk> was forced to borrow n million of subordinated debt
we would n't have had to refinance if a lot of the problems had n't been there <unk> <unk> says
this year <unk> <unk> says <unk> the firm will be able to service debt and still turn a modest profit
now <unk> could become entangled in a protracted legal fracas with its former parent
the company recently filed suit in state court in <unk> <unk> against <unk> brands seeking at least n million in damages from the <unk> <unk> conn.-based company
the suit alleges that <unk> <unk> misrepresented the financial condition of <unk> before the sale failed to disclose pending lawsuits and material contracts in which <unk> was in default had n't registered the <unk> name and trademark in the <unk> <unk> and did n't tell <unk> <unk> <unk> about some labor controversies
we have previously had discussions with representatives of <unk> <unk> concerning the sale of the company and we concluded that we did not have liability under the contract says <unk> <unk>
as this is now a litigation matter we have no further comment
and then there the case of the missing gold watch
the lawsuit alleges that an inventory of <unk> memorabilia disclosed that one of the watches had n't been forked over by <unk> brands
<unk> <unk> failure to surrender the gold watch has damaged new <unk> in an amount as yet n to be determined and deprived it of a valuable artifact for which it had bargained the suit charges
the key to <unk> future will be sticking to what it does best being a security company says <unk> <unk> <unk>
the company is also renewing its emphasis on investigations particularly undercover investigations for corporations
although investigations now account for only about <unk> of <unk> total revenue that side of the business has traditionally been the more glamorous of the two and it carries historical and sentimental value
author <unk> <unk> who wrote the <unk> <unk> was a former <unk> detective
<unk> brands just had a different approach <unk> <unk> says <unk>
their approach did n't work mine is
farm prices in <unk> edged up <unk> from <unk> as raw milk prices continued their rise the <unk> <unk> said <unk>
milk sold to the nation dairy plants and dealers averaged n for each hundred pounds up n cents from <unk> and up <unk> from <unk> <unk> the department said n

<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> completed the sale of its <unk> <unk> consumer and commercial finance subsidiary to a unit of <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> billion
<unk> which agreed to sell the unit in <unk> said n it would realize net proceeds from the sale of <unk> billion with an after - tax gain of <unk> billion
<unk> said <unk> the gain would be recorded in its fourth quarter which ended yesterday
<unk> said <unk> the sale completes the strategic restructuring n it began in <unk> and would enable it to focus on its entertainment and publishing businesses
<unk> said in <unk> <unk> it planned to operate <unk> based in <unk> as a separate entity in its <unk> <unk> services <unk>
<unk> said <unk> associates has about <unk> billion in total assets making it third - largest in terms of assets among independent finance companies in the <unk>
<unk> containers <unk> in a long - awaited move to repel a hostile takeover bid said n it will sell n billion of assets and use some of the proceeds to buy about <unk> of its common shares for n apiece
together with the n million shares currently controlled by management subsidiaries and directors the completed tender offer would give <unk> containers a controlling stake
describing itself as asset <unk> <unk> containers said n it will move immediately to sell two ports various ferries ferry services containers and other investments
of the proceeds n million will be used to fund its tender offer
<unk> containers added that the recapitalization plan will reduce its debt by more than n million
the company which has n million common shares outstanding said in mid - <unk> that it was considering a restructuring n to ward off a hostile takeover attempt by two european shipping concerns
in late <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> launched a <unk> or n million tender offer for the <unk> <unk> - based <unk> containers
in mid - <unk> the companies through their jointly owned holding company <unk> holdings <unk> sweetened the offer to <unk> a share or n million
officials for <unk> declined to comment
news of the restructuring plan sent <unk> containers shares up <unk> to <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> composite trading
<unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk> said that offering holders a higher n price is a fairly effective method of blocking the <unk> - <unk> bid
<unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> added that the sale of assets would allow <unk> containers to focus on its core container businesses
for holders who decide not to tender their shares <unk> <unk> will issue one share of preferred stock with a stated value of <unk> plus a cash dividend on the common stock
the company said <unk> its directors management and subsidiaries will remain long - term investors and wo n't tender any of their shares under the offer
<unk> <unk> said n the offer will proceed after the <unk> <unk> <unk> lifts or modifies an interim injunction restraining the company from buying its shares
that injunction resulted from litigation between <unk> and <unk> containers last <unk>
the company said <unk> the court has indicated <unk> it will make a decision on or about <unk> n
<unk> <unk> will soon set a date for its annual shareholder meeting to seek holder approval for the offer
you think n all the stories about well - heeled communities and developers getting <unk> grants would prompt <unk> to tighten up on upscale housing subsidies
no way
<unk> has just made it easier for the affluent to qualify for insured loans from the deficit - ridden <unk> <unk> <unk>
it appears that the only thing <unk> <unk> is learning from the <unk> story is how to enlarge its control of the honey pot going to special interests
right now the largest loan n the <unk> can insure in high - cost housing markets is <unk>
last week housing lobbies persuaded <unk> to raise the ceiling to <unk> making <unk> loans more accessible to the well - to-do
but it does that at the cost of deepening the taxpayer exposure if the <unk> is forced to pay for more loans going sour
this is no idle fear last year the <unk> lost n billion in loan defaults
but the higher mortgage ceiling is only the starter kit for what <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> have in mind for housing
the <unk> <unk> <unk> will begin hearings next week on their proposal to expand existing federal housing programs
other senators want to lower the down payments required on <unk> - insured loans
that would be a formula for ensuring even more <unk> red ink
experience has shown that the most important element in predicting a housing - loan default is the down payment
because a purchaser can use an <unk> loan to finance all points and closing costs the <unk> can wind up lending more than a house is worth
if housing prices continue to fall many borrowers would be better off walking away from their homes and leaving taxpayers with the losses
much the same thing happened with busted s&ls a problem <unk> <unk> just solved with a n billion bailout
we hear that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is toying with going along with some of the <unk> - <unk> proposals
that sounds like a formula for ensuring that he gets dragged into the next <unk> tar pit
a group of <unk> senators has written <unk> <unk> urging him to reject <unk> - <unk> and focus on programs that empower the poor rather than create vast new government obligations
but even if he agrees <unk> <unk> does n't write the nation housing law <unk> does
and the majority of members cynically view the current discrediting of <unk> as mainly a chance to shove through their own slate of projects
exhibit a is last week <unk> vote to fund n pet projects out of the same discretionary fund that is at the heart of the <unk> scandal
none of the grants had been requested by <unk> judged competitively or were the subject of a single hearing
more and more observers now realize that the key to ending future <unk> scandals lies in forcing <unk> to clean up its own act
this week a <unk> <unk> editorial said <unk> the <unk> subcommittee on <unk> should forget about <unk> <unk> testimony for the moment and call some other witnesses the various congressional sponsors of the <unk> pork - barrel projects
the <unk> concluded that <unk> <unk> is only part of the problem and a part that gone
if <unk> is to be reformed it concluded <unk> members of <unk> will have to start looking into and doing something about the practices of their colleagues
of course self - reform is about the last thing n this <unk> is interested in
proponents of expanding <unk> programs say n they merely want to help home buyers who are frozen out of high - priced markets
but the <unk> program is hemorrhaging bad loans
<unk> <unk> has submitted a package of reforms and they are surely headed for the <unk> <unk> sausage - grinder
like the <unk> mess before it this is a problem <unk> <unk> should be solving not ignoring
<unk> <unk> <unk> said n it is planning to restructure its south african subsidiary
under the plan <unk> <unk> <unk> will sell manufacturing facilities in <unk> <unk> <unk> and its business in toiletries and plastic bags to <unk> pharmaceuticals <unk> an affiliate of <unk> <unk> <unk> a south african company
terms were not disclosed
a final agreement has not been signed and the moves will not have a material effect on the company <unk> said <unk>
the company said <unk> it is part of a continuing world - wide restructuring in which it has downsized or sold operations in several countries
<unk> said <unk> its continued presence in <unk> <unk> enables it to make meaningful contributions to south african society to the lives of its employees and to the communities in which it operates

the soviet legislature approved a n budget yesterday that halves its huge deficit with cuts in defense spending and capital outlays while striving to improve supplies to frustrated consumers
the vote to approve

soviet <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> told the legislators n they had made a good start but that the most difficult work was still ahead
the <unk> news agency said <unk> the n budget anticipates income of n billion rubles us$ n billion and expenditures of n billion rubles us$ n billion
those figures are almost exactly what the government proposed to legislators in <unk>
if the government can stick with them it will be able to halve this year n billion ruble <unk> n billion deficit
officials proposed a cut in the defense budget this year to n billion rubles us$ n billion from n billion rubles us$ n billion as well as large cuts in outlays for new factories and equipment

<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> will sell its contract - drilling business and took a n million loss from discontinued operations in the third quarter because of the planned sale
the <unk> <unk> oil and gas exploration and diving operations company added that it does n't expect any further adverse financial impact from the restructuring
in the third quarter the company which is n by <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> had a net loss of n million or n cents a share compared with a restated loss of n million or n cents a share a year ago
the latest period had profit from continuing operations of n million

<unk> <unk> said n it will offer <unk> to n of the contract - drilling business through an initial public offering in the near future
it has long been rumored that <unk> <unk> would sell the unit to concentrate on its core oil and gas business
<unk> <unk> said n it wo n't hold any shares of the new company after the restructuring
after n years of pushing labor proposals n to overhaul the nation health - care system <unk> <unk> of the <unk> - <unk> is finding interest from an unlikely quarter big business
corporate leaders frustrated by double - digit increases in health - care costs are beginning to sound like liberal democrats
failure to check rising medical costs ultimately could lead some of us who today are free - market advocates to re - examine our thinking and positions with respect to government - sponsored national health insurance <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> vice president warned n earlier this year
the pocketbook impact of health benefits has driven business and labor to a surprising consensus
both the <unk> - <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of manufacturers are calling for measures <unk> to control rising costs improve quality and provide care to the n million americans who currently lack health insurance
agreement on these points is a long way from a specific program and nobody expects the <unk> to rush toward radical restructuring of the health - care system
but there are signs that labor - management cooperation could change the politics of health - care legislation and the economics of medicine
i ca n't remember a time when virtually everyone can agree on what the problem is says <unk> <unk> who heads the <unk> - <unk> department dealing with health matters
because the <unk> administration is n't taking the initiative on health issues business executives are dealing with congressional democrats who champion health - care revision
business across the country is spending more time addressing this issue says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
it a bottom - line issue
business complained earlier this year when <unk> <unk> introduced a bill that would require employers to provide a minimum level of health insurance to workers but does n't contain cost - control measures
partly in response a bipartisan group of senators from the finance and labor committees is drafting a plan n to attract broader support
it will feature a cost - containment provision designed to keep expanded benefits from fueling higher care prices
at <unk> of gross national product <unk> health costs already are the highest in the world
by contrast <unk> equal n of <unk> a nation total output of goods and services
management and labor worry that the gap makes <unk> companies less competitive
<unk> <unk> estimates that health costs add n to the price of each of its cars about <unk> to <unk> more per car than foreign competitors pay for health
the cost of health care is eroding standards of living and sapping industrial strength complains <unk> <unk> a <unk> health - and-benefits specialist
labor is upset because many companies are using higher employee insurance premiums deductibles and co - payments to deflect surging medical costs to workers
<unk> benefits are contentious issues in the strikes against <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
in their new contract this year <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> workers of <unk> agreed to look for prompt and lasting national solutions to rising health - care costs
some analysts are cynical about the new corporate interest in health - care overhaul
<unk> <unk> president of the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> scoffs at capitalists who want to socialize the entire financing system for health
they hope n they can buy some government cost discipline but this is a false hope <unk> <unk> says <unk>
he asserts that government has done an even worse job of controlling its health bill than business
so far neither the <unk> administration nor <unk> is prepared to lead the way toward revamping health care
the administration lacks a comprehensive health - care policy
<unk> still is struggling to dismantle the unpopular <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> which boosted benefits for the elderly and taxed them to pay for the new coverage
a bipartisan commission established by <unk> and headed by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is scheduled to present new plans for dealing with the uninsured and long - term care for the elderly by next <unk> <unk>
a quadrennial commission appointed by <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is taking a broad look at the economics of <unk> for the elderly <unk> for the poor and the health system in general
it is expected to report next summer
no magic bullet will be discovered next year an election year says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
but n could be a window for action
the pressure for change will rise with costs
i think n employers are really going to be the ones n to push for major change says <unk> <unk> a health expert at <unk>
any major attempt to revamp the health - care system is likely to trigger opposition from politically powerful interest groups particularly the <unk> <unk> <unk> and perhaps from the public as well if <unk> takes steps that patients fear <unk> will limit the availability of care
the <unk> embraces efforts which both the administration and the medical profession have begun to measure the effectiveness of medical treatments and then to draft medical - practice guidelines
advocates hope that such standards will improve treatment while limiting unnecessary tests and medical procedures
<unk> <unk> <unk> estimates that as much as <unk> of the medical procedures performed each year may be inappropriate or unnecessary
limiting care wo n't be easy or popular
to slow the rise in total spending it will be necessary to reduce per - capita use of services the <unk> warns in a policy statement
this will require us to define and redefine what is necessary or appropriate care
this involves trade - offs and it cuts against the grain of existing consumer and even provider conceptions of what is necessary
the <unk> - <unk> also embraces treatment guidelines
in addition it toying with an approach that would impose health - expenditure ceilings or budgets on the government as a whole and on individual states as a way n to slow health - care spending
at a meeting here on <unk> n the labor federation plans to launch a major effort to build grass - roots support for health - care overhaul
<unk> <unk> said n it plans to shut down three <unk> - area plants moving their fastener operations to a leased facility in <unk> <unk>
the company said <unk> the fastener business has been under severe cost pressures for some time
the fasteners nuts and bolts are sold to the <unk> american auto market
a company spokesman declined to estimate the impact of the closures on earnings
he said n the new facility will employ n of the existing n employees
the steelmaker employs about n people
<unk> said <unk> it has an option to lease a n building in <unk> and proposes to spend n million canadian dollars <unk> n million on the facility
the three existing plants and their land will be sold
<unk> <unk> <unk> said n it tentatively agreed to acquire <unk> <unk> . for stock valued at about n million
terms call for <unk> <unk> to issue about <unk> share of its stock for each <unk> share held or a total of about <unk> <unk> <unk> shares
it has about n million shares outstanding
<unk> with about n million in assets is the parent of the <unk> <unk> which has six offices and headquarters at <unk> <unk> <unk>
the purchase price is equal to about <unk> times <unk> roughly n million book value or assets less liabilities

on <unk> <unk> takeover stock traders bid <unk> stock well above the <unk> - <unk> bid assuming that <unk> will either be sold to a rival bidder or to <unk> - <unk> at a higher price as much as <unk> a share according to some estimates
yesterday <unk> common closed in composite <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> trading at <unk> up <unk> on volume of almost n million shares
<unk> - <unk> closed down n at n in <unk> <unk> trading
takeover stock traders noted that with the junk - bond market in disarray <unk> - <unk> bid is an indication of where the takeover game is headed namely industrial companies can continue bidding for one another but financial buyers such as leveraged buy - out firms will be at a disadvantage in obtaining financing
the way n the world is shaping up the strategic buyer is going to be the rule and the financial buyer is going to be the exception said one trader
for the paper industry specifically most analysts said <unk> the deal will spur a wave of paper - company takeovers possibly involving such companies as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
the analysts argued that <unk> - <unk> offer the first hostile bid ever among major players in the paper industry ends the unwritten taboo on hostile bids and will push managements to look closely at the industry several attractive takeover candidates
<unk> has been long overdue
it was just the culture of the industry that kept it from happening
the <unk> - <unk> offer has definitely changed the landscape said <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
added <unk> <unk> of <unk> - <unk> securities <unk> it much easier to be second
a <unk> - <unk> acquisition of <unk> would create the largest <unk> forest - products company
based on <unk> sales <unk> - <unk> ranked third at n billion behind <unk> <unk> at <unk> billion and <unk> <unk> <unk> at <unk> billion
<unk> ranked n with sales of n billion
the combined company would have had n sales of n billion
but such a combination also presents great risks
at a time when most analysts and industry consultants say n pulp and paper prices are heading for a dive adding capacity and debt could squeeze <unk> - <unk> if the industry declines more than the company expects
moreover any unexpected strengthening of the dollar would hurt <unk> - <unk> because two of <unk> major product lines containerboard which is used to make shipping boxes and market pulp are exported in large quantities
nobody knows how deep the cycle is going to be said <unk> <unk> vice president of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> economic - forecasting firm
depending on how far down you go it may be difficult to pay off that debt
one person familiar with <unk> - <unk> said <unk> the acquisition would more than double the company debt of almost n billion
it also could be a drag on <unk> - <unk> earnings because the roughly n billion in goodwill the amount by which the bid exceeds <unk> book value of n billion will have to be subtracted from earnings over a period of decades
<unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> said that a combined operation would allow savings in many ways
the two companies each produce market pulp containerboard and white paper
that means n goods could be manufactured closer to customers saving shipping costs he said n
moreover production runs would be longer cutting inefficiencies from adjusting machinery between production cycles
and <unk> - <unk> could save money in selling pulp because the company uses its own sales organization while <unk> employs higher - cost agents
<unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> - <unk> has accounted in its strategy for a significant downturn in the pulp and paper industry an event that he said <unk> would temporarily dilute earnings
but he said that even under those conditions the company still would realize a savings of tens of millions of dollars in the first year following a merger
the fit is so good we see this as a time of opportunity he said
<unk> - <unk> which has suspended its stock - repurchase program would finance the acquisition with all bank debt provided by banks led by <unk> <unk>
<unk> - <unk> owns <unk> <unk> shares and would need federal antitrust clearance to buy more than n million worth
<unk> clearance also is needed for the proposed acquisition
for <unk> defense options may be undercut somewhat by the precarious state of the junk - bond market which limits how much value the target could reach in a debt - financed recapitalization
the company chairman <unk> <unk> and a group of advisers met at the offices of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a law firm specializing in takeover defense
<unk> also is being advised by <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> - <unk> advisers are <unk> <unk> <unk> which stands to receive a n million fee if the takeover succeeds and the law firm of <unk> <unk>
people familiar with <unk> said <unk> its board is n't likely to meet before the week after next to respond to the bid
the board has n business days n to respond
in addition to the usual array of defenses including a so - called poison pill and a staggered board <unk> has another takeover defense a <unk> state law barring hostile bidders from merging acquired businesses for five years
<unk> is incorporated in <unk>
<unk> - <unk> has filed a lawsuit in federal court in <unk> challenging the poison pill and the <unk> merger law
<unk> poison pill allows shareholders to vote to rescind it but <unk> - <unk> is n't likely to pursue such a course immediately because that would take <unk> to <unk> days and would n't affect the provisions of the <unk> law
among companies mentioned by analysts as possible counterbidders for <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
i sure n everybody else is putting pencil to paper said <unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk> declined to comment
<unk> <unk> could n't be reached for comment and <unk> <unk> said <unk> it has n't any plans to make a bid for <unk>
investors were quick to spot other potential takeover candidates all of which have strong cash flows and low - cost operations
among paper company stocks that rallied on the <unk> <unk> because of the offer were <unk> <unk> up <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> up <unk> to <unk> <unk> up <unk> to <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> up <unk> to n
in over - the-counter national trading <unk> <unk> jumped <unk> to n
some analysts argued that there wo n't be a flurry of takeovers because the industry continuing capacity - expansion program is eating up available cash
moreover some analysts said <unk> they expect a foreign paper company with deeper pockets than <unk> - <unk> to end up acquiring <unk> signaling to the rest of the industry that hostile bids are unproductive
this is a one - time event said <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> referring to the <unk> - <unk> bid
but many analysts believe that given the attractiveness of paper companies cash flows as well as the frantic consolidation of the paper industry in <unk> there will be at least a few more big hostile bids for <unk> companies within the next several months
the buyers these analysts added n could be either foreign or other <unk> concerns
the <unk> - <unk> bid may open the door to a new era of consolidation in the paper industry said <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
i do n't think <unk> anyone is now immune from takeover said <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
he added every paper company management has to be saying to itself before someone comes after me i going to go after somebody
<unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> he does n't see the industry capacity - expansion program hindering takeover activity
several projects he said n are still on the drawing board
moreover it a lot cheaper and quicker to buy a plant than to build one
indeed a number of analysts said that japanese paper companies are hungry to acquire additional manufacturing capacity anywhere in the world
some predicted that <unk> will end up being owned by a japanese company
meanwhile <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said that to stay competitive the <unk> paper industry needs to catch up with the european industry
since the most - recent wave of friendly takeovers was completed in the <unk> in n there have been more than n mergers and acquisitions within the european paper industry he said n
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> the <unk> and <unk> <unk> granted full marketing approval for a new drug for the treatment of a condition in which the heart beats between <unk> and <unk> beats a minute

private industry labor costs rose n in the third quarter matching the second - quarter pace as health insurance costs continued to soar the <unk> <unk> said <unk>
the increase in wage and benefit costs in the third quarter was greater than the <unk> rise reported for the third quarter of <unk>
wage increases and overall compensation increases are beginning to curl upward a little bit said <unk> <unk> a labor economist at the <unk> <unk> a business research organization
one would have thought <unk> this would have happened two or three years ago as the labor market tightened
it is a considerably delayed reaction and it not a severe one at all she added
the new data underscored the severity of the nation health - care cost problem
in the <unk> months ended in <unk> wages and salaries of private - sector workers rose n while health insurance costs spurted by <unk>
the consumer price index climbed <unk> in the same period
despite the big increases in health - care costs wages still account for a far greater share of overall labor costs
the overall private - sector employment cost index which includes both wages and benefits rose n in the <unk> months ended in <unk> compared with n for both the <unk> months ended in <unk> and the <unk> months ended <unk> n
labor costs are climbing at a far more rapid pace in the health care industry than in other industries
for instance wages of private - sector hospital workers leaped <unk> in the <unk> months ended in <unk> compared with n for workers in all industries
in the third quarter wages and salaries in all private industry rose n compared with n increases in both the second quarter and in the third quarter of <unk>
for the past five years unions have n't managed to win wage increases as large as those granted to nonunion workers
for private - sector union workers the cost of wages and benefits rose n in the third quarter
for nonunion workers the costs rose n
labor costs continued to rise more rapidly in service industries than in goods - producing industries the report showed <unk>
it also found them rising much more in the <unk> than elsewhere
including employees of state and local but not the federal governments the employment cost index rose <unk> in the third quarter compared with a <unk> rise in the same quarter in <unk>
the index rose <unk> in the second quarter
for the n months ended in <unk> this index was up <unk>
it rose n for the <unk> months ended in <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> months ended in <unk> n
unlike most economic indicators none of these figures are adjusted for seasonal variations

the <unk> <unk> <unk> chemical coatings concern which has about n employees world - wide said n it plans to sell its domestic rigid container packaging and flexible adhesives businesses and its <unk> <unk> <unk> resin plant

<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said n it withdrew its offer to acquire <unk> airlines because the <unk> <unk> carrier did n't respond to its offer by the close of business yesterday a deadline <unk> <unk> had set for a response
however <unk> is n't abandoning its pursuit of the much - larger <unk>
<unk> which has a <unk> stake in <unk> said n it may purchase more <unk> stock or make a tender offer directly to <unk> shareholders
<unk> had proposed acquiring <unk> for <unk> a share and one share of a new series of <unk> <unk> convertible preferred stock n it values at <unk> a share
earlier <unk> had rejected a general proposal from <unk> to combine the two carriers in some way

the dollar drew strength from the stock market climb

prices of other paper makers rose sharply although <unk> - <unk> fell <unk> a share to n
despite all the furor over program trading program trading played a big role in yesterday rally
some traders point out that as the big brokerage firms back out of program trading for their own accounts or for clients opportunities increase for others to engage in the controversial practice
that what happened yesterday
the rally notwithstanding there are plenty of worries about the short - term course of stock prices
a slowing economy and its effect on corporate earnings is the foremost concern of many traders and analysts
unless the <unk> <unk> eases interest rates soon to stimulate the economy profits could remain disappointing
yesterday major economic news a n rise in the <unk> index of leading economic indicators had little impact on financial markets
but the next important piece of news on the economy health this morning release of the national purchasing manager survey for <unk> could prompt investors into action
a report late yesterday that the <unk> - area purchasing managers survey showed increased economic activity in that part of the country cut into bond - price gains
if the national survey confirms a pickup in the manufacturing sector it could further depress bond prices while bolstering stock prices and the dollar
meanwhile bond investors are laboring under the onus of a national debt ceiling debate
although the <unk> is expected to announce details of its <unk> quarterly refunding operation today the <unk> n schedule could be delayed unless <unk> and the president act soon to lift the nation debt ceiling

the company did n't specify reasons for the strong earnings gain
but <unk> said <unk> its first - half profit is n't indicative of the full - year trend because of the highly seasonal nature of many of the company activities
for all of <unk> <unk> had consolidated profit of n million francs after payments to minority interests on revenue of <unk> billion francs
the group has forecast <unk> revenue of <unk> billion francs
<unk> <unk> <unk> said n it completed its acquisition of <unk> <unk> . for about n million
<unk> agreed to pay n and one - eighth <unk> share for each of <unk> <unk> million fully diluted shares
the acquisition brings together the two largest competitors to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which now reaches more viewers than any other company in the video shopping industry
among them <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> already control most of that young and fast - growing market which last year had sales of about <unk> billion

it includes removing n million in good will from the books issuing n million in preferred stock and commencing an exchange offer for n million in convertible bonds
during the third quarter the company charged about n million against earnings in reducing goodwill added n million to its general loan loss reserves and established a n million reserve for its high - yield bond portfolio

<unk> <unk> <unk> . is launching a massive corporate advertising campaign that will put the tobacco giant name in tv commercials for the first time since the early n when it stopped advertising its namesake cigarette brand on television
the campaign a patriotic celebration of the <unk> anniversary of the <unk> of rights does n't mention cigarettes or smoking cigarette ads have been prohibited on television since <unk>
but even before it begins the campaign is drawing fire from anti - smoking advocates who criticize <unk> <unk> attempt to bolster its beleaguered image by wrapping itself in the document that is a cornerstone of american democracy
<unk> <unk> which became the <unk> largest food company last year with its n billion acquisition of <unk> <unk> seems determined to evolve beyond its roots in <unk> country
the company research suggests that its name recognition among most consumers remains unusually low although its array of brands including <unk> <unk> coffee <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> beer blanket supermarket shelves
the company is expected to spend about n million a year on its two - year corporate campaign created by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> unit in <unk> <unk>
the initial spots will appear during morning and prime - time news shows
<unk> <unk> hopes that by taking its <unk> of rights theme to the airwaves in addition to publications it will reach the broadest possible audience
until now its corporate ads mainly promoting its sponsorship of the arts have appeared almost exclusively in newspapers and magazines
most people whether in <unk> <unk> or <unk> have n't got a clue who we are says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> vice president of corporate affairs
if they think well of the company through our support of the <unk> of rights it follows n they think well of our products
<unk> <unk> says <unk> the <unk> of rights commercial which trumpets the themes of liberty and freedom of expression is n't designed to have any special appeal for smokers
although <unk> <unk> typically tries to defend the rights of smokers with free - choice arguments this has nothing <unk> to do with cigarettes nor will it ever the spokesman says n
but some anti - smoking activists disagree expressing anger at what they see as the company attempt to purchase innocence by association
i outraged because this company is portraying itself at the heart of american culture and political freedom and in fact it a killer says <unk> <unk> former chairman of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and a tobacco - industry critic
it should be treated like the <unk> drug mafia not the founding fathers
<unk> <unk> adds that the new commercial dovetails perfectly with major aspects of <unk> <unk> political strategy
these include trying to protect its print advertising by invoking the <unk> <unk> and wooing blacks by portraying itself as a protector of civil rights
the commercial features among others the voice of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the slain civil rights leader
many marketers say <unk> <unk> <unk> approach will be effective but they agree that the ads implied smoking message is unmistakable
this is clever subliminal advertising that really says smokers have rights too says <unk> <unk> chairman of <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> marketing strategy firm
this is designed to get the wagons in a circle and defend the smoking franchise
<unk> <unk> a partner at <unk> <unk> <unk> adds it very popular to drape yourself in the flag these days
if you can do that and at the same time send a message that supports your business that brilliant
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> brands <unk> say <unk> they have no plans to follow <unk> <unk> lead
indeed <unk> <unk> is currently under fire for having sent n videotapes touting its <unk> brand to consumers who smoke <unk> <unk> <unk>
despite the criticism <unk> <unk> corporate campaign runs little risk of getting yanked off the tube
they are n't showing <unk> <unk> taking a puff or lighting up says <unk> <unk> a professor of constitutional law at <unk> <unk>
all n they are trying to do is borrow some of the legitimacy of the <unk> of rights itself
technology stocks woke up helping the over - the-counter market rise from its recent doldrums
the <unk> <unk> <unk> surged <unk> or about <unk> to n
it was the market biggest gain since rising more than n points on <unk> n
advancing <unk> stocks outpaced decliners by <unk> to n
but the move lagged a stronger rise in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> issues
the <unk> <unk> composite index was up more than <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> jumped <unk>
<unk> gain was led by its biggest industrial stocks
the <unk> <unk> rose <unk> to n
the <unk> <unk> of <unk> biggest banks and insurance issues added <unk> to n
other strong sectors were indicated in gains of the <unk> <unk> up <unk> to <unk> and the <unk> <unk> up <unk> to n
<unk> <unk> <unk> volume improved to n shares from n million <unk>
many of <unk> biggest technology stocks were in the forefront of the rally
<unk> added <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> rose <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk>
<unk> was up <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk>
but traders who watch the stocks warned <unk> the rise may be yet another one - day phenomenon
technology stocks bore the brunt of the <unk> market recent sell - off and traders say n it natural that they rebound sharply now that the market has turned around
but they caution conservative investors would do well to sell into the strength
they are always the first n to be sold when people are taking profits because people are most scared of the high - technology stocks said <unk> <unk> director of research for <unk> <unk> <unk> division which specializes in emerging growth stocks
the technology group includes many of the <unk> market biggest stocks which dominate the market - weighted <unk> <unk> <unk>
analysts say <unk> rallies in the group historically have lifted the market while weakness in the sector often sank unlisted share prices broadly
but increasing volatility in the sector has exhausted investors who try to follow its dips and swings
the stocks have been pummeled repeatedly by inventory gluts and disappointing earnings as the industry matures and slows
some even claim <unk> the group has become a lagging not leading indicator
the technology sector of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has risen only about <unk> this year while the <unk> <unk> <unk> has gained <unk>
while the composite index lost less than a third of its year - to-date gains in the market recent decline the technology group gains were more than halved
the <unk> technology sector is far from a cohesive unit
the group is divided primarily between software semiconductors and computers
while computer stocks have taken the biggest hit from the slowdown in the industry many software and semiconductor stocks have continued to outperform the market
<unk> is up more than <unk> this year while <unk> is up more than <unk>
the technology group is also split between large companies and small with the biggest stocks trading as blue - chip issues in the institutional marketplace while the smaller stocks churn on their individual merits or faults analysts say
the volatility of smaller technology companies has served the group well overall in recent stock trading according to <unk> <unk> technology stock indexes
the brokerage firm tracks technology stocks with its <unk> <unk> which appreciated only n in the first nine months of this year
but the firm also tracks smaller technology companies as a subset of the larger group
that index which contains technology companies with annual revenues of n million or less gained n by <unk> n this year still lagging the <unk> <unk> but leading larger technology firms
yesterday bank stocks lagged behind the overall <unk> market
the <unk> <unk> <unk> rose <unk> to n
<unk> <unk> who trades bank stocks for <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> the stocks tend to fall behind because they are n't traded as much as many other issues
but he added n interest - rate-sensitive stocks in general are stalled
the interest - rate sensitives are n't rallying with the rest of the market because of fears about what the <unk> <unk> will do <unk> <unk> said
he said that investors will scour the <unk> employment report due out <unk> for clues about the direction of the economy and the immediate outlook for interest rates
on the other hand <unk> <unk> noted that the recent slide in bank and thrift stocks was at least halted yesterday
<unk> <unk> <unk> gave small investors some welcome news by announcing that it would no longer handle index - arbitrage-related program trades for its accounts
<unk> with its in - house order execution system has handled the bulk of such program trades in the over - the-counter market
the trading has been blamed for much of the market recent volatility
<unk> topped the most - active list as its american depository receipts climbed <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> with more than n million adrs traded
<unk> said n it would waive its golden share in the luxury auto maker if shareholders vote to allow a suitor to acquire more than <unk> of the company
the announcement effectively removes the british government as an impediment to a takeover of the company which is being stalked by <unk> motors and <unk>
<unk> - <unk> was another active takeover stock
it surged <unk> <unk> to <unk> on volume of more than n million shares after the company agreed to be acquired by <unk> <unk> <unk> for about n million almost double the market price of <unk> - <unk> stock

<unk> <unk> said yesterday that it remains committed to the merger
<unk> <unk> gained <unk> to <unk> <unk> after it said <unk> it agreed to buy <unk> associates and two affiliates for cash and stock
the value of the transaction was n't disclosed
the companies being acquired provide telecommunications services to the telephone industry
<unk> industries whose stock has suffered steep losses in recent sessions surged <unk> <unk> to n
the stock was one of many in the paper products industry that rose following <unk> - <unk> <unk> billion bid for <unk> <unk> <unk>
a permanent smoking ban on virtually all domestic airline routes won approval from the <unk> which separately sent to <unk> <unk> a nearly n billion fiscal <unk> bill including the first construction funds for the space station
the smoking prohibition remains attached to a n billion transportation bill that must still overcome budget obstacles in <unk>
but yesterday action put to rest any lingering resistance from tobacco interests
faced with inevitable defeat the once dominant industry declined any recorded vote on the ban which covers all but a fraction of <unk> of daily flights in the <unk>
the sole exceptions are an estimated n flights of six hours or more beginning or ending in <unk> and <unk>
assuming final enactment this month the prohibition will take effect <unk> days later or in early <unk>
on a n roll call the <unk> adopted the underlying transportation measure
but the bill still faces budget questions because it also is the vehicle for an estimated n billion in supplemental appropriations for law enforcement and anti - drug programs
the additional spending pushes the measure more than n billion above its prescribed budget ceiling and the <unk> <unk> <unk> leadership must now seek a waiver in hopes of completing action today
the separate n billion bill sent to the <unk> <unk> had budget difficulties too but was saved ultimately by its importance to a broad spectrum of interests in <unk> and the administration itself
no single bill this year includes more discretionary spending for domestic programs and apart from the space station the measure incorporates far - reaching provisions affecting the federal mortgage market
the current ceiling on home loans insured by the <unk> <unk> <unk> is increased to <unk> during fiscal n
and in anticipation of increased lending the cap on <unk> loan guarantees would rise to approximately n billion
separately the bill gives authority to the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> to facilitate the refinancing of high - interest loans subsidized by the government under the so - called section n home - ownership program for lower - income families
this provision met early and strong resistance from investment bankers worried about disruptions in their clients portfolios
but the promise of at least n million in new savings helped to forge a partnership between <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and lawmakers wanting to protect their projects elsewhere
the estimated n billion for the space station would be double last year level and total appropriations for the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> would grow n to nearly n billion
a string of costly projects including the high - speed national aerospace plane and the advanced communications technology satellite would continue to be developed within these limits
and while imposing a statutory cap of n billion on future spending the bill would give <unk> <unk> million for the start - up of the <unk> - <unk> mission a successor to the <unk> space probe
separately the <unk> <unk> <unk> is promised a n increase to bring its appropriations to n billion
and while pursuing these initiatives <unk> and the <unk> <unk> are squeezed too by steady increases n million in veteran medical care
the result is that all sides resort to sleight of hand to make room for competing housing and environmental programs and the commitments now will drive excess spending into fiscal n
senior members of the <unk> <unk> <unk> are reduced in frustration to raising doomed parliamentary obstacles to individual bills yet admit that much of the disorder now stems from the fiscal legerdemain associated with their own summit agreement with the <unk> <unk> this past spring
it hard to get the administration attention on anything said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> because the whole agreement was built on gimmickry
among the subsidies continued in the transportation bill is n million n to maintain commercial air service for an estimated n communities often in rural areas
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> strongly resisted deeper cuts sought by the <unk>
but at a time when the <unk> <unk> wants to kill the entire program republicans have been among its leading champions
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the ranking <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> used his influence to preserve more than <unk> in subsidies for air service to <unk> <unk> <unk> and more than n million would go for service to eight communities in the western <unk> district of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> appropriations <unk>
<unk> <unk> an independent airline serving much of <unk> estimates that nearly n of its revenues come from the subsidies that in some cases exceed the cost of a ticket
for example a passenger can fly from <unk> <unk> to <unk> for as little as <unk> to <unk> according to prices quoted by the company
but given the few number of users the cost to the federal government per passenger is estimated at <unk> according to <unk> and <unk> appropriations committees
the <unk> action yesterday came as the <unk> remained mired in difficulties over a n billion measure covering the budgets for the <unk> <unk> and <unk> departments in fiscal <unk>
the compromise bill passed the <unk> last week but has now provoked jurisdictional fights with the <unk> <unk> relations <unk> which jealously protects its prerogatives over operations at the <unk> <unk>
the same jealousy can breed confusion however in the absence of any authorization bill this year
<unk> and <unk> appropriators sought to establish a <unk> n deadline after which their bill would become the last word on how funds are distributed
but on a n roll call this provision was stripped from the bill last night after <unk> relations <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> complained that it was an intrusion on exclusive powers vested in his panel for more than three decades
<unk> <unk> <unk> said n it arranged a n million credit facility with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a unit of <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
the <unk> oil and gas concern said that n million of the facility would be used to consolidate the company n million of existing bank debt to repurchase n million of its n million shares outstanding of <unk> <unk> convertible preferred stock and to purchase a n net - profits interest in certain oil and gas properties from one of its existing lenders <unk> <unk> <unk>
the remaining n million can be used over three years for oil and gas acquisitions the company said n
<unk> <unk> <unk> president said <unk> the loan carries an interest rate of prime plus one percentage point with <unk> of the company net oil and gas revenue each month dedicated to repayment
the company put up virtually all of its oil and gas properties as collateral he said n
<unk> <unk> <unk> was given an n million <unk> <unk> contract for <unk> aircraft and related equipment
<unk> <unk> defense systems division received a n million <unk> <unk> contract for a <unk> weapons system trainer
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> won n million in <unk> <unk> and <unk> contracts for transportation services
<unk> <unk> machines <unk> was given a n million <unk> <unk> contract for satellite data systems equipment
<unk> technologies received a n million <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> contract for advanced propulsion systems research
<unk> <unk> <unk> got a n million <unk> <unk> <unk> contract for combat camouflage trousers
<unk> <unk> <unk> was the kind of story n <unk> <unk> loved
since the value of its assets was n't known analysts were free to pick a number
in one of many rosy scenarios <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> wrote in <unk> that its real estate alone had a value of n billion
throw in its railroad minerals pipeline and oil assets he and others argued and the <unk> - based conglomerate should be worth <unk> a share
and why should holders expect to realize that presumed worth
that was another reason n the <unk> loved <unk> <unk>
with real estate experts <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> owning close to <unk> of <unk> <unk> stock management was under pressure in a favored phrase of <unk> <unk> to quickly maximize values
but value it turns out n is only what a buyer will pay
and with the company recent announcement that it is contemplating a partial sale of its real estate the values suddenly look poorer
<unk> <unk> has disclosed that it is negotiating to sell a <unk> interest in its real estate unit to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for roughly n million
since the real estate unit also includes debt the imputed value of the real estate itself is close to <unk> billion
the implied current net asset value of n per share is well below the <unk> level that the <unk> believed <unk> says
the upside was in the intangible real estate which is no longer an intangible
so what is <unk> <unk> worth
if the railroad is valued on a private market basis at the same multiple of earnings as in the recent sale of <unk> it would have a value of n billion
a compromise between bulls and bears puts remaining assets and cash including its <unk> stake in its publicly traded pipeline at <unk> billion
<unk> <unk> also has n billion in debt
in addition its railroad lost a n million antitrust suit which is on appeal and which analysts say n could be settled for one - third that amount
that nets out to about <unk> a share for the company on a private market basis
but <unk> <unk> currently trading at <unk> <unk> is n't likely to realize private market values by selling assets because the tax against it would be onerous
its plan instead is to spin off the remainder of its real estate unit and to possibly do the same with its mining and energy assets
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman argues that since its businesses are valued in different ways the sum of the parts may be greater than the whole
but it is n't clear why that should be so
the spinoff argument after all reverses the current notion that assets are worth more to private buyers than to public shareholders
and real estate usually has n't traded well under public ownership
<unk> <unk> says we believe n the real estate properties would trade at a discount after the realty unit is spun off
and what about the cost and risk of waiting to realize the hypothetical private market values
some analysts remain bullish
<unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> says n he is recalculating the worth of the company assets and in the meantime is sticking to his buy recommendation on the belief that he will find values of <unk> a share
he adds if for any reason i do n't have the values then i wo n't recommend it
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> values <unk> <unk> at <unk> down from her earlier estimate of <unk>
her recent report classifies the stock as a hold
but it appears to be the sort of hold n one makes while heading for the door
quoting from the report the stock narrow discount to asset valuation makes it a relatively unappealing investment at current prices especially given the risk that our projections could be on the aggressive side
<unk> <unk> says <unk> the <unk> pension fund is getting a bargain price that would n't have been offered to others
in other words the real estate has a higher value than the pending deal suggests
since most of the unit real estate is in <unk> the pension fund will be a useful political ally in a state where development is often held hostage to zoning boards
and as <unk> <unk> says with <unk> and <unk> on the unit board the real estate will be run by a very unusual group to say the least
it is possible then that <unk> <unk> real estate even in a state imperiled by earthquakes could one day fetch a king ransom
but as <unk> analyst <unk> <unk> notes its properties will be developed over <unk> to n years
so despite <unk> <unk> rosy talk of quickly maximizing values holders could be in for a long wait

a <unk> official also said n he sent the <unk> <unk> of <unk> a packet of documents relating to a previously reported <unk> contribution from <unk> parent solicited by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
federal examiner <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> operations amounted to pyramiding debt to provide a luxurious life style for its owners
another federal examiner <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> principal owner <unk> <unk> <unk> and his family drew off at least n million from the thrift in salaries bonuses and proceeds from securities sales in the <unk> <unk> years before federal authorities seized it earlier this year
<unk> collapse may cost taxpayers as much as n billion according to estimates making it the most expensive thrift failure in history
i think n there overwhelming evidence n to indicate probable criminal activity said <unk> <unk> who participated last year in an examination of the <unk> <unk> thrift
he said n the evidence pointed to wrongdoing by <unk> <unk> and others although he did n't allege any specific violation
<unk> <unk> a <unk> state official who last year examined <unk> parent <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> he also saw evidence that crimes had been committed
it sure smells like it he said
he said <unk> <unk> of the loans n he sampled were dead meat on the day n they were made
the state examiner also said <unk> supervisors of a parallel federal examination seemed so reluctant to demand write - downs of <unk> bad loans that he immediately grew suspicious
later on my concerns about a whitewash became even more serious he said
he called the sour loans appalling and added you opened the file up and it just jumped at you
<unk> <unk> a <unk> attorney for <unk> parent corporation said in an interview we deny any criminal behavior by the association or its officers
those who testified yesterday have consistently maintained that anyone who did n't agree with them is part of a coverup a whitewash or the subject of excessive influence <unk> <unk> said
we simply do n't agree with that or the findings of their investigation
<unk> <unk> deputies complained that they had n't been given an opportunity to respond to the criticism brought out during the <unk> <unk> hearings which <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has used as a forum to flay <unk> <unk> handling of the affair and to demand that he step aside from his job
a couple of things <unk> <unk> <unk> said were at least misleading said <unk> <unk> one of the <unk> regulators responsible for the handling of <unk>
in an interview he said n federal regulators eventually declared one of the loans n the state regulator cited to be a total loss and forced <unk> to make an n million downward adjustment on another
our response to the whitewash would simply be n look what happened another <unk> official <unk> <unk> said in an interview
federal officials seized the association in <unk> a day after the parent corporation entered bankruptcy - law proceedings

state thrift examiner <unk> <unk> said <unk> he found the chief federal examiner <unk> <unk> to be totally uninterested in one allegedly fraudulent series of transactions
frankly it was like he worked for the <unk> public - relations department <unk> <unk> testified
and <unk> <unk> a federal examiner who worked under <unk> <unk> said <unk> he found his chief oddly upbeat about <unk>
asked to comment a spokesman for <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> has spoken to his attorney who has advised him not to talk to anybody
<unk> <unk> said that a day or two before <unk> parent entered bankruptcy proceedings he and other examiners saw a truck with a sign on it that said n it was from the <unk> <unk> <unk>
we observed at least two large plastic bags of shredded paper loaded into this truck
<unk> <unk> said <unk> the paper had been donated to a charitable organization that sells it for recycling
they shredded it simply because it contained financial information about their creditors and depositors
<unk> <unk> said <unk> his suspicions were aroused by several foreign investments by <unk> including n million paid to <unk> <unk> of <unk> an <unk> million interest in saudi <unk> <unk> in <unk> a n million investment in a bahamas trading company and a recently discovered holding in a <unk> - based company <unk> holdings

<unk> <unk> <unk> is boosting the prices of flat rolled steel products by an average of <unk> following a recent erosion in the prices of such crucial steel products
the big questions are whether the increase effective <unk> n <unk> will stick and whether other major steelmakers will follow suit
it is widely expected that they will
the increase is on the base price which is already being discounted by virtually all steel producers
but <unk> move marks the first effort by a major steelmaker to counter the free fall in spot prices
major steel producers are selling cold rolled sheet steel at about <unk> a ton compared with a peak price of <unk> a ton in n
second - tier companies are receiving even less per ton
<unk> planned increase which was announced in an <unk> n memo to district managers does n't affect electrogalvanized steel or tin plate
<unk> confirmed the price - increase plan saying n the move is designed to more accurately reflect the value of products and to put steel on more equal footing with other commodities
a spokesman for <unk> <unk> which is a unit of <unk> - based <unk> <unk> noted that steel prices adjusted for inflation increased only <unk> between <unk> and the fourth quarter of n while the prices of other industrial commodities increased nearly five times as much
at the same time steelmakers are trying to invest more to modernize technology and make themselves more competitive
but analysts say n the company is also trying to prevent further price drops
moreover they note that <unk> may be trying to send a signal to major customers such as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> that steelmakers need more money
both companies are in the process of negotiating contracts with <unk> and others
they <unk> may believe <unk> this can impact contract negotiations and is their signal to the world that now is the time <unk> to get tough on prices said <unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> believes <unk> spot steel prices will continue to fall through early n and then reverse themselves
he is n't convinced though that the price decline reflects falling demand because the world economy remains relatively strong
and while customers such as steel service centers are continuing to reduce inventories through the fourth quarter they eventually will begin stocking up again he notes n
it wo n't be clear for months whether the price increase will stick
steelmakers announced a round of base - price increases last year but began offering sizable discounts over the summer
in fact <unk> was the first steelmaker <unk> to publicly boost discounts for buyers of cold rolled sheet steel and hot - dipped galvanized sheet steel

<unk> <unk> has been viewed by many exchange members as being indifferent to stock - price swings caused by program trades
he said n he is very surprised by the furor over program trading and the exchange role in it that has raged in recent days
<unk> <unk> said that the <unk> <unk> has been trying to deal quietly with the issue but that banning computer - assisted trading strategies entirely as some investors want would be like taking everybody out of an automobile and making them ride a horse
the exchange has a board meeting scheduled for tomorrow and it is expected that some public announcement could be made after that
<unk> <unk> officials have been under seige from both investors and the exchange own floor traders since the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> tumble on <unk> n
<unk> <unk> has n't been making public remarks in recent days and many people have urged him to take more of a leadership role on the program trading issue
what the <unk> <unk> is considering is re - establishing a collar on program trading when the market moves significantly
early last year after a n one - day drop in the <unk> the <unk> <unk> instituted the collar which banned program trading through the <unk> <unk> computers whenever the <unk> moved <unk> points up or down in a day
it did n't work
the collar was penetrated on a number of occasions meaning n securities firms figured out ways <unk> to conduct program trades to circumvent the collar and use the <unk> <unk> electronic trading system <unk> <unk> said <unk>
that was when the exchange took a new tack by publishing monthly statistics listing the top n program trading firms
exchange officials emphasized that the <unk> <unk> is considering a variety of actions <unk> to deal with program trading
people familiar with the exchange said <unk> another idea likely to be approved is expanding the monthly reports on program trading to cover specific days or even hours of heavy program trading and who was doing it

<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> unit said n it ceased all index - arbitrage program trading for client accounts

<unk> <unk> recent remarks that investors simply must get used to the stock - market volatility from program trading have drawn criticism from both the exchange stock specialists who make markets in individual stocks and from many companies that have shares listed on the <unk> <unk>

if bringing the message is a crime i guilty of it
but he said n this does n't mean <unk> he is satisfied with the market big swings
we trying to take care of a heck of a lot of constituents <unk> <unk> said
each one has a different agenda
for example in a special meeting <unk> with <unk> <unk> senior officials of some of the <unk> <unk> n stock specialist firms complained that the exchange is no longer representing their interests
we are looking for representation n we have n't had a specialist said
we had dictation
after another session <unk> <unk> <unk> held yesterday with major brokerage firms such as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> all of which have engaged in program trading an executive of a top brokerage firm said clearly the firms want the exchange to take leadership
many specialist firms resent the <unk> <unk> new basket product that allows institutions to buy or sell all stocks in the <unk> <unk> <unk> index in one shot
ultimately the specialists view this as yet another step toward electronic trading that could eventually destroy their franchise
his <unk> own interests are in building an electronic marketplace said a market maker
the basket product while it has got off to a slow start is being supported by some big brokerage firms another member of <unk> <unk> splintered constituency
<unk> <unk> has had difficulty convincing the public that the <unk> <unk> is serious about curbing volatility especially as the exchange clearly relishes its role as the home for <unk> billion in stock - index funds which buy huge baskets of stocks to mimic popular stock - market indexes like the <unk> <unk> <unk> and which sometimes employ program trading
the <unk> <unk> wants to keep such index funds from fleeing to overseas markets but only as long as it handles it intelligently <unk> <unk> said
despite what some investors are suggesting the <unk> <unk> is n't even considering a total ban on program trading or stock futures exchange officials said n
most revisions n it will propose will be geared toward slowing down program trading during stressful periods said n officials working with the exchange
computers have made trading more rapid but that can be fixed with some fine - tuning
i think n if you can speed things up you can slow them down <unk> <unk> said
that different than wrecking them
while volatility wo n't go away he said <unk> volatility is greater than program trading
what i trying to say to people is <unk> it proper to worry about program trading but it only a piece of the business
for example <unk> <unk> said that big institutions have so much control over public investments that they can cause big swings in the market regardless of index arbitrage
a lot of people would like to go back to <unk> before program trading he said n
i would like to go back to n
but we not going back to n
indeed <unk> <unk> said that if stock - market volatility persists the <unk> may lose its edge as being the best place <unk> to raise capital
<unk> markets are more stable he said
if that continues a significant number of <unk> companies will go over there to raise money
in coming days when the <unk> <unk> formulates its responses to the program - trading problem <unk> <unk> may take a more public role in the issue
<unk> <unk> <unk> vice chairman of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said this is a problem that taking on a life of its own
the program trading situation seems to have driven individual investors as well as others out of the market and even europeans are suspicious
the exchange should take a pro - active position

the <unk> <unk> <unk> voted <unk> that <unk> accounting rules supercede <unk> rules in regard to utilities hospitals and colleges and universities owned by the government

after the <unk> was founded in <unk> <unk> years after the <unk> the government - owned entities were supposed to follow <unk> rules unless the <unk> superceded them
the <unk> had told governments n they did n't have to follow <unk> rules on depreciation making it difficult for bond - rating agencies to compare private and state - owned schools which compete in the public bond market
the foundation vote is effective for the affected government entities with fiscal years that begin starting next <unk> <unk> and makes the financial results of the hospitals colleges and schools easier to compare with for - profit businesses
but it may lead to separate financial reports based on different rules for the government entities under <unk> rules and those still under <unk> rules

<unk> last week held an auction to pick the contractor expecting to pay about n million yen for the project
eight companies submitted bids but <unk> won the contract by essentially saying n it would do the job for free
news of the bid drew sharp criticism from other computer companies and industry observers

wary investors have been running for the stock market equivalent of bomb shelters buying shares of gold - mining and utility companies
those two groups have recently been leading the list of stocks setting new highs
on <unk> when only a dozen common stocks hit n highs on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> five were gold - mining issues and another four were utilities
on <unk> when a mere seven common stocks managed new highs six were utilities or golds
at first glance gold and utilities seem strange bedfellows
after all gold prices usually soar when inflation is high
utility stocks on the other hand thrive on disinflation because the fat dividends <unk> utilities pay look more attractive when prices are falling or rising slowly
but the two groups have something very important in common they are both havens for scared money stocks for people who hate stocks
it as if investors the past few days are betting that something is going to go wrong even if they do n't know what
if the stock market and the economy catch their breath and show that they on firmer footing these stocks might well fall back
indeed that happened to some extent yesterday as industrial stocks rebounded partly on news of takeovers in the paper industry
still a lot of investors clearly have revived their interest in gold and utility shares
the primary overriding thing is that people are frightened says <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> money manager
the aftershocks of <unk> n when the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> dropped <unk> points are still reverberating
certainly the <unk> n sell - off did n't settle any stomachs
beyond that money managers and analysts see other problems
inventories are creeping up car inventories are already high and big auto makers are idling plants
takeover fever has cooled removing a major horse from the market cart
<unk> unsettled political scene also worries some investors
the gyrations in the british government add political uncertainty on top of high inflation and a ragged stock market says <unk> <unk> <unk> assistant director of research at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
one of the three major markets in the world is getting chewed up pretty bad
if the <unk> does not come to the rescue and produce lower short - term interest rates over the next <unk> days the market going to flounder says <unk> <unk> a market analyst with <unk> - <unk> securities
with this sort of sentiment common it natural for investors to seek out defensive investments
utilities are a classic example even in recessions people continue to use electric power water and gas at a fairly steady rate
such defensive issues as food tobacco and drug stocks have been in favor for some time
but many of these stocks have now become expensive
<unk> <unk> points to <unk> - <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> as examples they selling for <unk> to <unk> times estimated n per - share earnings
gold stocks are n't cheap on this basis either with many selling for <unk> times earnings or more
even utility stocks are n't all that inexpensive at an average of <unk> times earnings
but the two groups represent a further step in defensiveness
if gold stocks and utilities continue to lead it may signal that the market is in for rough times
that just what <unk> <unk> expects
we are going to explode lower says the flamboyant market seer who had a huge following a few years back
anyone telling you to buy stocks in this market is technically irresponsible
you do n't want to own anything long except gold stocks
one reason for his gloom is a weekly tally n he keeps of stocks within a point of hitting new highs or lows
last <unk> <unk> stocks on the <unk> <unk> hit new n lows
but by <unk> <unk> count <unk> issues were within one point of such lows
<unk> <unk> a veteran <unk> <unk> money manager and president of <unk> - <unk> securities has money in both gold and utility issues
i think n we could very well have an economic slowdown beginning very soon if not already he says
<unk> <unk> does n't expect an actual recession
but he does expect a muffler dragger of an economy with very slow growth maybe one quarter of no growth at all
in such a climate utility stocks look good to him
he favors <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
the appeal of gold issues <unk> <unk> says <unk> is that they a counter group
you go into them because they move counter to the general market
he adds that gold stocks had been down so long n they were ready for a bounce
his favorites are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
nevertheless <unk> <unk> emphasizes that you do n't buy gold stocks based on powerful fundamentals
in addition to having high price - earnings ratios most pay puny dividends if any
the earning power of gold mining companies is restricted unless the gold price hops up over <unk> an ounce he says
<unk> <unk> an investment strategist for <unk> <unk> <unk> also thinks n it makes sense to have some money in both utilities and gold
my outlook is for a decline of about n in corporate profits in <unk> she says
but a bunch of utilities should post profit increases
among utilities <unk> currently favors <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
as for gold she notes that it usually rises when the dollar is weak as it has been lately
among gold stocks <unk> likes <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk>
it never ceases to amaze me how the business world continues to trivialize the world environmental problems is science or private gain driving ozone policy by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> n
to suggest that a <unk> drop in ozone by the middle of the next century would be negligible is irresponsible and shortsighted
consider the fact that a mere <unk> drop in ozone would increase birth defects and mutations by allowing solar radiation to alter the dna structure
even a small reduction is unacceptable and to suggest otherwise is penny - wise and pound - foolish
the reason n environmentalists do n't mind seeing new crises arise is because there are new crises
crises larger and more dangerous to the quality of life than they were n years ago
if you are doubtful consider for a moment that the <unk> lakes reservoirs in northern <unk> <unk> which supply the tristate area with drinking water are riddled with toxic pcbs
this is a fact and not the product of some environmental doomsayer or a group ploy to create a market
it time n business leaders and the general public learn that mankind does not rule over this natural environment but is rather the integral symbiotic player within nature workings
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> column was right on the money but i wish <unk> it could have gone one step further
as an employee of a major refrigerator and freezer manufacturer i have been heavily involved in dealing with the political manifestations of the <unk> - <unk> theory named after the researchers who found in <unk> that chlorofluorocarbons contributed to the depletion of ozone in the earth atmosphere and the <unk> <unk>
an important part of my effort has been to understand the science so i can explain it to corporate colleagues facing major changes in product design
in my research i have found a paper by <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and several colleagues reporting an n decrease in uv - b radiation at eight <unk> measurement sites
our concern for the ozone layer of course grows out of the potential for increasing uv - b radiation which could damage flora and fauna
the last of the measurements reported was in <unk> but recent conversations with <unk> <unk> indicated that he knew of no recent changes in the trend
i understand but have n't yet verified that there are studies by norwegians russians and the <unk> <unk> <unk> that show either unchanging or declining uv - b at the surface
to me this calls into question the validity of the <unk> - <unk> theory and hence the whole chlorofluorocarbons replacement effort
this in turn threatens the massive vested interests of which you have written
my questions on this subject at a recent meeting at the <unk> resources <unk> with representatives of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> friends of the <unk> etc . were greeted with derision and some mumbled comments about that report being discredited
when i expressed amazement that no one was undertaking a more current and credible uv - b study i was urged to get back to the agenda topic which was ironically a schedule for getting rid of hcfcs the so - called soft cfcs that are such an important part of the <unk> substitution scenario
subsequently i have learned that a private group of which <unk> <unk> is a part is funding a modest program to continue data gathering at the <unk> report stations as well as to develop more sophisticated uvb measuring instruments
but this is almost an underground activity
to my knowledge no government entities including the <unk> are pursuing uv - b measurements
the topic never comes up in ozonedepletion establishment meetings of which i have attended many
it seems to me that such measurements are a vital part of any intellectually honest evaluation of the threat posed by cfcs
while recognizing that professional environmentalists may feel threatened i intend to urge that uv - b be monitored whenever i can
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> relations <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the relationship between surface release of cfcs and global stratospheric ozone loss was identified back in n
although like all scientific theories it had its initial opponents few experts question the connection now
the discovery of the ozone hole over <unk> and the results of ground - based and high - altitude aircraft experiments conducted over the past several years serve as evidence that ozone depletion is related to <unk> concentrations
in the <unk> issue of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> distinguished member of the technical staff at <unk> <unk> laboratories and <unk> <unk> <unk> director of the air chemistry division of the <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> wrote it is now quite evident that chlorofluorocarbons particularly <unk> and <unk> are the major culprits responsible for ozone depletion
<unk> <unk> quotes <unk> <unk> and invokes the name of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to support his statement
however unlike messrs. <unk> and <unk> who are both pioneers in the study of atmospheric chemistry <unk> <unk> has no special expertise in the area
he is a mechanical engineer not an atmospheric chemist
it is insulting and demeaning to say that scientists needed new crises to generate new grants and contracts and that environmental groups need them to stay in business
solving the global environmental problems n we all face will require an unprecedented level of cooperation and communication among industry policy makers and the scientific community world - wide
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>

<unk> <unk> told industry analysts n he is moving aggressively to negotiate out - of-court settlements on a number of shareholder lawsuits but noted that the company could file for bankruptcy - law protection if settlement talks fail
<unk> <unk> also noted that n million shares of <unk> common stock were traded during the past three years so there a tremendous amount of exposure
<unk> has said that its financial results for the past three fiscal years would have to be restated because of the allegedly fraudulent accounting and marketing practices that inflated revenues and net income
<unk> also has n't filed any financial statements for n
<unk> <unk> said <unk> such statements should be ready by the end of <unk>
he said <unk> he expects the company to have n million in sales for this year
he did n't say what the company expected to report for year - earlier sales which will be restated from the previously reported n million
the release of <unk> new balance sheet came one day after it introduced its new line of one - inch disk drives on which it is pinning much of its hope for survival
although it is not the first company <unk> to produce the thinner drives which store information in personal computers <unk> says n it is the first with an <unk> drive the company plans to introduce a <unk> drive next year
analysts and consultants had mixed reactions to yesterday announcements praising <unk> <unk> efforts but questioning whether the company can survive in a highly competitive marketplace
it a wait - and-see attitude said <unk> <unk> vice president of storage research for <unk> <unk> <unk>
others pointed out that at least four other disk - drive makers will have competitive one - inch drives early next year and that the industry already operates on very thin margins
the company also faces delisting by the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
the company continues to trade in the over - the-counter market with an exception to listing requirements
<unk> filed a status report with the <unk> on <unk> detailing its efforts to comply with listing requirements and requesting an extension of the exception but has n't received a response
<unk> common closed yesterday at <unk> down n cents and has been trading for several months at less than <unk> a share
meanwhile <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> is reviewing the report prepared by <unk> outside directors to determine if criminal charges should be brought before a grand jury
the <unk> report outlines a host of allegedly fraudulent practices including the shipment of bricks and defective disk drives that were booked as sales and inventory forgeries in accounting records
the internal investigation also criticized <unk> auditors <unk> <unk> for allegedly ignoring numerous red flags
<unk> <unk> said <unk> the board still has n't acted on most of the internal report recommendations pending restatement of the balance sheet
he added that he expects to make a recommendation within a few weeks on whether <unk> should file its own lawsuits against former company officers and directors

by concentrating all their resources on the pay raise <unk> and <unk> the networks actually overlooked some major stories that showed the flaws and shortcomings of the institution
an imaginative producer could easily have created a fast - moving and interesting piece about how <unk> really works and why voters in say <unk> <unk> got a federally funded university project and building while voters in <unk> did not
but nobody did such a piece reflecting a contemporary axiom the more a scandal has to do with a congressman duties as a congressman the less likely it is to catch the fancy of a network
ethicist <unk> <unk> in one of his institute recent publications on <unk> in the <unk> <unk>
the operative definition of newsworthiness will favor virtually unrestrained use of personal sensitive and intimate facts
traditional standards of relevancy and importance is this something n the public ought to know will be replaced by a much broader test is this something n the public is interested in knowing
and since the public has always been fascinated by gossip and voyeurism reporters and editors will strain for creative angles to justify the inclusion of collateral facts about private lives including sexual activities and domestic relationships activities of family members and all matters about mental and physical health
similarly visual images will be more vivid sensational and sometimes gruesome
one consequence of the trend toward tabloid standards of taste will be fierce attacks from politicians who will find sufficient evidence of abuse n to arouse an already cynical public to control the press
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> won permission from the <unk> <unk> <unk> to move the company private placement department to its fledgling securities subsidiary
the seemingly mundane action which was opposed by the securities <unk> <unk> a trade group has important implications for banks recent entry into the underwriting of corporate securities
the <unk> action increases the volume of publicly registered securities that banks securities affiliates will be able to underwrite
several other banks have similar applications pending
over the past two years the <unk> has given a handful of banks securities affiliates permission to underwrite and deal in a variety of corporate asset - backed and municipal securities that had previously been the sole domain of securities firms
securities firms have challenged those <unk> approvals saying n they violate federal laws separating the banking and securities businesses
however the <unk> limited the revenue that banks could earn from these new underwriting activities to no more than <unk> of the revenue earned from other securities activities long open to banks such as dealing in <unk> treasurys
for some banks that n ceiling created problems
but by allowing <unk> <unk> <unk> to handle private placements the <unk> boosted the volume of new types of underwriting that the unit can do
private placements involve debt and equity securities typically in denominations of n million that are sold to institutional investors and are n't registered with the securities and <unk> <unk>
last year bankers <unk> said n it placed <unk> billion of corporate debt and equities privately

as many as n of his employees at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ride with him
when they return to their desks at n p.m. they have pedaled <unk> miles
such fervor for cycling helped <unk> <unk> build a creative company at the forefront of its industry
founded by bike enthusiasts rather than businessmen <unk> spotted the appeal of fat - tired bikes that go almost anywhere and began mass - producing them in <unk>
in the past five years the company sales have grown to n million from n million
today so - called mountain bikes account for two - thirds of the n billion spent annually on all bicycles in the <unk>
with <unk> of its sales coming from mountain bikes specialized is widely considered to be a market leader
accessories largely for mountain - bike users account for much of the rest of sales
but today the company needs its entrepreneurial spirit more than ever
one large competitor after another is leaping into the booming market <unk> <unk> helped create turning out mountain bikes with such well - known names as <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
thus <unk> <unk> company must innovate more than ever to stay ahead of them by developing new products specifically for mountain biking
at the same time though it must become more structured to better manage its growth
accomplishing both will be a balancing act as challenging as riding a unicycle
it is a problem common to small companies that have grown fast especially when their success attracts big - time competitors
the big word around <unk> is passion says <unk> <unk> a former ski - industry executive whom <unk> <unk> recruited from <unk> to run marketing and sales
what i hope to bring to this is another word process
that my challenge
it <unk> challenge as well
<unk> <unk> is one of several key people from outside the cycling industry who were hired to bring the free - wheeling fast - growing company under tighter control
we had a lot of problems <unk> <unk> says
while the company sales were soaring we still had a system that was probably appropriate for n million to n million in sales
adds <unk> <unk> what felt good that day was done that day
since his arrival in <unk> <unk> <unk> has put in place techniques learned while working for <unk> such as management - by-objective detailed project plans and forecasts of company sales and product trends
we finally getting and it been very painful some understanding of what the company long - term horizon should begin to look like <unk> <unk> says
but it risky he says of <unk> attempt to adopt a corporate structure
you do n't want to lose the magic of the company creative drive
hoping to stay ahead of the pack the company is emphasizing innovation
at a recent trade show convention - goers lined up to view a new <unk> bike frame that weighs just n pounds a pound less than the lightest mountain - bike frame on the market

at the trade show <unk> also unveiled a revolutionary three - spoked bike wheel developed jointly by <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
made of space - age materials the wheel spokes are designed like airplane wings to shave n minutes off the time of a rider in a <unk> race the company claims n
it currently costs n though <unk> <unk> thinks <unk> the price can be reduced within three years to between <unk> and <unk>
he was able to slash the price of the company least expensive mountain bike to <unk> from <unk>
but demands on the company creativity are certain to grow
competition is intensifying as larger companies invade a mountain - bike market <unk> <unk> <unk> company once had virtually all to itself
<unk> <unk> <unk> official <unk> <unk> says <unk> mountain biking is growing at such a monstrous rate that a lot of companies are getting into this

competition in the sale of complete bikes is heating up too

the move is sure to heighten concerns about increased japanese investment in <unk> biotechnology firms
it is also likely to bolster fears that the japanese will use their foothold in <unk> biotechnology concerns to gain certain trade and competitive advantages
<unk> - <unk> an industry leader in the field of genetic probes which is a new technology used in diagnostic tests last year signed an agreement for <unk> to exclusively market its diagnostic products in <unk> for infectious diseases and cancer
<unk> agreed then to fund certain associated research and development costs
that arrangement apparently has worked well and <unk> <unk> <unk> president and chief executive officer of <unk> - <unk> founded in <unk> said <unk> the sale of the company means n we will be able to concentrate on running the business rather than always looking for sources of financing
<unk> agreed to pay <unk> a share for <unk> - <unk> n million common shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis
yesterday in national trading in the over - the-counter market <unk> - <unk> common closed at <unk> a share
because the <unk> leads in most areas of biotechnology largely because of research investment by the <unk> government the sale is sure to increase concerns that japanese companies will buy american know - how and use it to obtain the upper hand in biotechnology trade and competition
the biotechnology firms may be setting up their own competitors said <unk> <unk> president of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
he added that until now the japanese have only acquired equity positions in <unk> biotechnology companies
they are piggybacking onto developed technology he said
during the past five years japanese concerns have invested in several of the <unk> <unk> independent biotechnology companies
<unk> has been one of the most active japanese players in <unk> biotechnology companies it has an equity investment in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and a joint - venture agreement with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the japanese government <unk> <unk> said <unk> has stated that it wants <unk> to n of its gross national product to come from biotechnology products
it is becoming more of a horse race every day between the <unk> and <unk> he said adding that some fear that as with the semiconductor electronics and automobile industries japanese companies will use u.s.-developed technology to gain trade advantages
<unk> <unk> said <unk> the sale would allow <unk> - <unk> to speed up the development of new technology and to more quickly apply existing technology to an array of diagnostic products n the company wants to offer
by n when only n genetic probe - based tests of diagnostic infectious diseases of humans had been approved for marketing by the <unk> and <unk> <unk> eight of them had been developed and sold by <unk> - <unk>
<unk> <unk> deputy president of <unk> which spends about n of its sales on research and development was unable to pinpoint how much money <unk> would pump into <unk> - <unk>
we think n <unk> - <unk> has technology important to people health he said adding we think n it is important for us to have such technology
he and <unk> <unk> emphasized that both companies would gain technological knowledge through the sale of <unk> - <unk> which will expand significantly as a result of the acquisition
in <unk> <unk> had net income of n million on revenue of n million

it was supposed to be a routine courtesy call
a half - dozen soviet space officials in <unk> in <unk> for an exhibit stopped by to see their counterparts at the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>
but after a few pleasantries the soviets unexpectedly got serious
the soviets have a world - leading space program the guests noted n
would n't the japanese like a piece of it
the visitors then listed technologies up for sale including launch services and propulsion hardware
we were just surprised says <unk> <unk> <unk> director for international affairs
shocked
that <unk> with its dilapidated economic machine would try to sell high technology to <unk> one of the world high - tech leaders sounds like a coals - to-newcastle notion
but the <unk> <unk> has areas where it is n't behind <unk> says <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> relations
we have obtained through the development of <unk> the soviet space program technologies n you do n't see anywhere else
the sales pitch might n't be as farfetched as it seems
<unk> - <unk> trade relations are bumpy these days and some japanese favor decreasing their reliance on <unk> technology in light of the <unk> fighter - plane flap when <unk> officials reversed an earlier decision and refused to share certain crucial fighter - plane technology
and despite its image as a technology superpower <unk> has a lot of weaknesses
it a world leader in semiconductors but behind the <unk> in making the computers that use those chips
it a world leader in auto manufacturing but its aviation industry is struggling and its space program is years behind the <unk> the europeans and the soviets
one question being debated in the <unk> <unk> is how to use the defense sector research - and-production expertise in the rest of the economy
many plants that used to make military equipment are now being ordered to produce televisions videocassette recorders small tractors and food - processing machinery
the soviets also hope to make better use of their considerable expertise in theoretical science which has helped them win twice as many <unk> science prizes as the japanese
where they lag behind the japanese is in turning the scientific inventiveness into improved production
by contrast the japanese have proved adept at making use of soviet inventions
<unk> <unk> <unk> adopted soviet casting technology in n and used it for n years until it developed its own system
<unk> <unk> <unk> bought a soviet steel - casting patent two years ago and has jointly developed the system with the soviets
in <unk> the soviets will take a japanese journalist into space the first japanese to go into orbit
soviet efforts to sell their technology abroad do n't appear to worry the <unk> <unk> principal ally
we have never opposed the development of economic relations between our allies and the <unk> <unk> says a <unk> <unk> official
frankly i would n't expect the japanese to get hooked on anybody technology least of all the soviets
under <unk> <unk> perestroika the soviets have sought economic ties all over the world including new export markets
they believe <unk> technology is one of their best bets and some soviet officials say n <unk> will even consider declassifying military know - how if the price is right
the soviets held export exhibitions that included high - tech items in <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
last week a soviet delegation came to <unk> to push more space technologies
<unk> is a major target for the soviets
in <unk> representatives of <unk> <unk> largest business organization visited <unk> to explore exports and investments that would help the soviet economy
out of the blue the <unk> <unk> of <unk> handed over details on <unk> technologies that the japanese might want to buy
these mainly involved such areas as materials advanced soldering machines for example and medical developments derived from experimentation in space such as artificial blood vessels
a main motive is hard cash
but while the soviets ca n't expect direct technology flow from <unk> they also hope to benefit from japanese manufacturing expertise
the <unk> <unk> has a lot of know - how but it has been difficult to put that into actual production because of various structural problems in the economy says <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> official
the soviets are contemplating a flexible system under which it would be possible to develop technology jointly and even to market it jointly he says n
even if the japanese find soviet technology desirable such discussions would be fraught with political complications
still stinging from the international backlash over the sale two years ago of sensitive military technology to the soviets by a subsidiary of <unk> <unk> <unk> many japanese are eager to avoid appearing to help the soviets in any way
another hurdle concerns <unk> attempts to persuade the <unk> <unk> to relinquish its post - <unk> <unk> <unk> control of four islands north of <unk>
so far the soviets have provided only the sketchiest information about their technology and business plans
and what they have shown is n't impressive
my impression is that there is n't anything which arouses our interest at first glance says an official from <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk>
<unk> <unk> in <unk> contributed to this article
during its centennial year the <unk> <unk> <unk> will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of american business history
<unk> <unk> <unk> signaled a distressful <unk> <unk> for securities houses which were forced to end n years of charging fixed commissions
it scared brokers but most survived

despite warnings from such leaders as former <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that unfixed commissions would undo the industry the <unk> in <unk> <unk> said n full competition must start <unk> l n
the timing for change was right
institutions had become active market players in the early n and sought exchange seats to handle their own trades
and the industry was rife with brokers trying to secure big client orders by using kickbacks gifts women and junkets
within three weeks of the <unk> end to fixed rates there were all - out price wars among brokers fighting for institutional business with rate slashes of <unk> to n below pre - <unk> n levels
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman said <unk> the breadth and depth of the discounting is more than i expected
even a federal measure in <unk> allowing houses to add research fees to their commissions did n't stop it
longer term the impact is unclear
the change prompted the rise of discount brokers and a reduction in securities research firms
but there are currently more exchange members than in <unk> with the bigger houses gaining a larger share of total commissions
commissions however account for a smaller share of investment - house business as takeover advisory fees have soared
foreign stock markets with which the <unk> is entwined also have ended fixed commissions in recent years
it came in <unk> <unk> <unk> n deregulation and <unk> <unk> <unk> the same year
<unk> is currently phasing out fixed commissions under its <unk> <unk> <unk> plan

in addition the <unk> <unk> said that <unk> <unk> chairman of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> chairman of <unk> <unk> <unk> will be among a group of at least n business and labor representatives in the presidential mission
<unk> <unk> said <unk> the group is to focus on economic sectors where <unk> expertise and cooperation can indeed make a difference

but record industry executives familiar with the talks said <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> came to an agreement yesterday to form a n joint - venture company funded by <unk> and run by <unk> <unk>
among other things they said <unk> <unk> <unk> would develop musical acts for a new record label
the agreement is said to be similar to <unk> <unk> partnership with record and movie producer <unk> <unk> whose films and records are distributed by the <unk> bros. studio and the <unk> records unit
although <unk> <unk> wo n't produce films at first it is possible that he could do so later the sources said n

for <unk> meanwhile it gives the company a second young partner with a finger on the pulse of the hottest trends in the music business
the <unk> <unk> <unk> a former rock roll manager is credited with turning around <unk> once - moribund music division in his six years at the company
but <unk> <unk> had been negotiating for more than a year to get out of his <unk> contract which expired in <unk>
<unk> <unk> reportedly was bored and frequently clashed with top <unk> management over a number of issues such as compensation and business plans
<unk> <unk> also was eager to return to a more entrepreneurial role in which he had a big financial stake in his own efforts
in an interview at the time of his resignation from <unk> he said i rather build a company than run one
part of a <unk>
<unk> <unk> had a perfectly good reason for not using the <unk> rowing machine n he bought three years ago
i ate a bad tuna sandwich got food poisoning and had to have a shot in my shoulder he says making it too painful to row
the soreness he admits <unk> went away about a week after the shot
yet the rowing machine has n't been touched since even though he has moved it across the country with him twice
a <unk> <unk> lawyer <unk> <unk> rowed religiously when he first got the machine but he complains n it left grease marks on his carpet and it was boring
it a horrible machine actually
i ashamed <unk> i own the stupid thing
<unk> <unk> has plenty of company
nearly three - fourths of the people who own home exercise equipment do n't use it as much as they planned according to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of buying survey
the <unk> <unk> which conducted the survey said <unk> almost half of the exercise equipment owners found it duller than they expected
it is n't just exercise gear that is n't getting a good workout
the fitness craze itself has gone soft the survey found n
fewer people said n they were working up a sweat with such activities as jogging tennis swimming and aerobics
half of those surveyed said n they simply walk these days for exercise
that good news for marketers of walking shoes
the survey also detected a bit more interest in golf a positive sign for country clubs and golf club makers
the survey findings certainly are n't encouraging for marketers of health - club memberships tennis rackets and home exercise equipment but people good intentions if not their actions are keeping sales of some fitness products healthy
for instance sales of treadmills exercise bikes stair climbers and the like are expected to rise n to about <unk> billion this year according to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which sees the home market as one of the hottest growth areas for the <unk>
but even that group knows n some people do n't use their machines as much as they should
the first excuse is <unk> they do n't have enough time says research director <unk> <unk>
the second is <unk> they do n't have enough discipline
with more than n million exercise bikes sold in the past five years he adds n a lot of garages basements and attics must be populated with them
still the average price of such bikes rose last year to <unk>
<unk> <unk> predicts a trend toward fewer pieces of home exercise equipment being sold at higher prices
electronic gimmicks are key
<unk> <unk> <unk> for example peddles the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> stationary cycle
on a video screen riders can see <unk> different rides including urban mountain and desert scenes and check how many calories are burned a minute
<unk> <unk> who works in corporate payments at <unk> of <unk> in <unk> <unk> may be a good prospect for such a gizmo
she trying to sell a <unk> exercise bike n she bought about five years ago for her roommate
but rather than write off home fitness equipment she traded up <unk> <unk> just paid about <unk> for a fancier stationary bike with a timer dials showing average and maximum speeds and a comfortable seat that feels almost like a chair
i using it a lot she says
i spent so much money that if i look at it and i not on it i feel guilty
the poll points up some inconsistencies between what people say and what they do
a surprising n of people said n they exercise regularly up from <unk> in <unk>
this conjures up images of a nation full of trim muscular folks and suggests <unk> couch potatoes are out of season
of course that is n't really the case
the discrepancy may be because asking people about their fitness regime is a bit like inquiring about their love life
they bound to exaggerate
people say n they swim and that may mean <unk> they been to the beach this year says <unk> <unk> research specialist for the <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> and <unk>
it hard to know if people are responding truthfully
people are too embarrassed to say n they have n't done anything
while she applauds the fact that more americans are getting up from the television to stroll or garden she says n the percentage of americans who do real exercise n to build the heart is only <unk> to n
so many people fudge on answers about exercise n the president council now uses specific criteria to determine what is considered vigorous it must produce contractions of large muscle groups must achieve n of maximum aerobic capacity and must be done three or more times a week for a minimum of <unk> minutes
one of the council goals set in <unk> was to see more than <unk> of adults under n years of age getting vigorous exercise by <unk>
that target has been revised to <unk> by the year n
but even that goal may prove optimistic
of <unk> activities the <unk> survey found that <unk> including bicycling skiing and swimming are being done by fewer americans today than eight years ago
time pressures and the ebb of the fitness fad are cited as reasons for the decline
only walking and golf increased in popularity during the n and only slightly
<unk> <unk> a <unk> lawyer gave up running three times a week to play a weekly round of golf finding it more social and serene
it an activity <unk> she feels n she can do for life and by pulling a golf cart she still gets a good workout
i really wiped out after walking five hours she says
most people said n they exercise both for health and enjoyment
if you sit down all the time you go stiff says <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> homemaker who walks several miles a week
and it relaxing
sometimes if you have a headache you can go out and walk it right off
only about a quarter of the respondents said <unk> they exercise to lose weight
slightly more like <unk> <unk> a law librarian in <unk> <unk> who attends dance aerobics five times a week exercise to relieve stress
working with lawyers she says i need it
but fully n of those polled felt n they did n't need to belong to a health club
they too crowded and everybody showing off says <unk> <unk> a <unk> student from <unk> <unk>
the guys are being macho and the girls are walking around in little things
they not there to work out
but at least they show up
nearly half of those who joined health clubs said <unk> they did n't use their membership as often as they planned
feeling n they should devote more time to their families or their jobs many yuppies are skipping their once - sacred workout
even so the <unk> of <unk> <unk> a health - club trade group in <unk> says n membership revenues will rise about <unk> this year from last year n billion

perhaps the most disturbing finding is that the bowling alley may be an endangered american institution
the survey reported n the number of people who said n they bowl regularly has fallen to just n from <unk> in <unk>
the <unk> <unk> <unk> claims n a higher percentage of the public bowls regularly but concedes <unk> its membership has declined this decade
to find out why the group recently commissioned a study of the past <unk> years of bowling - related research
three reasons were pinpointed a preference for watching bowling and other sports on television rather than actually bowling dowdy bowling centers and dissatisfaction with bowling itself

democracy is making a return with a vengeance to <unk> <unk> most populous and deeply indebted country
on <unk> n when brazilians elect a president for the first time in n years the country n million voters will have <unk> candidates n to choose from
the candidates have been crisscrossing this huge country of n million people holding rallies and televised debates in hope of being elected to what must be one of the world most thankless political jobs trying to drag <unk> out of its economic and social mess
i feel sorry for whoever wins says a brazilian diplomat
who that winner will be is highly uncertain
a half - dozen candidates backing policies ranging from <unk> to watered - down <unk> are given a chance of winning
whoever says <unk> he knows which of the six will win is out of his mind says <unk> <unk> a centrist member of <unk>
the favorite remains <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> former governor of the state of <unk>
he came out of nowhere to grab the lead in opinion polls probably less because of his vague program n to build a new <unk> than because of his good looks the open backing of the powerful <unk> <unk> television network and his reputation as a hunter of maharajahs or overpaid and underworked civil servants
but after building up a commanding lead the moderate to conservative <unk> <unk> has slipped to about <unk> in the polls from a high of about <unk> only a few weeks ago
to avoid a runoff one candidate would have to win <unk> of the vote a feat that most analysts consider impossible with so many candidates running
two left - wing politicians socialist <unk> <unk> a former governor of <unk> <unk> <unk> state and <unk> - leaning <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> currently are running neck and neck at about n and three other candidates are given a chance of reaching the <unk> <unk> runoff election between the two biggest vote - getters <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and two conservatives <unk> <unk> <unk> a former governor of the state of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
the uncertainty is sending shivers through brazilian financial markets
the dollar the best indicator of the country mood has skyrocketed on the parallel market as has gold
capital flight is reported to be strong
the big question is whether the new president will have the strength and the political support in <unk> <unk> to take steps to cure <unk> economic ills
<unk> <unk> <unk> who took office in <unk> when the man picked by an electoral college became critically ill appears to be simply trying to avoid hyperinflation
the unpopular <unk> <unk> whose task was to bring about a smooth transition to democracy after <unk> years of military rule is n't seeking re - election
what comes out of the ballot box could be crucial in determining whether <unk> finally lives up to the potential of the world eighth largest economy or keeps living up to its other less enviable title that of the developing world largest debtor teetering on the brink of hyperinflation mired in deficits and stagnation with huge economic inequalities and social discontent boiling under the surface
if <unk> devises an economic strategy allowing it to resume growth and service debt this could lead it to open up and deregulate its sheltered economy analysts say just as argentinian <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has been doing even though he was elected on a populist platform
depending on the president we could either be a trillion - dollar economy by the end of the century or stay where we are says political scientist <unk> <unk> <unk>
and where we are is bad
despite valiant efforts by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> inflation came to <unk> in <unk> alone and is expected to top n for the year
that might have been considered hyperinflation not long ago but <unk> endured price increases of almost n in <unk> before bringing the rate down sharply in <unk> and <unk>
still massive internal debt has forced the government to borrow massively on the domestic market and to offer inflation - adjusted returns of <unk> to n a month just to get investors to hold on to its paper
about n billion is estimated to be tied up in the short - term money market which acts both as a hedge against inflation for consumers and an accelerator of inflation and deficits for the government
by some estimates <unk> internal debt or combined public deficit could reach <unk> of its <unk> billion gross domestic product
much of the money goes into subsidies or keeping inefficient state - controlled companies operating
among the results is a frequent breakdown of public services
it not uncommon to wait three minutes for a dial tone after picking up the telephone and then to be interrupted by a busy signal before finishing dialing the number
officials also say n a national electricity shortage might not be far off
economists businessmen and some politicians agree that the answer is an orthodox economic austerity program including reduced state spending focusing spending on vital areas such as education health and welfare turning state companies private reforming the tax system raising public service rates to match costs and possibly a temporary wage and price freeze and a devaluation of the cruzado
analysts also say n it inevitable that <unk> will seek to renegotiate its n billion foreign debt on which it suspended interest payments last month
analysts say however that a tough economic program would have to be accompanied by measures <unk> to shield the poor from its recessionary effects for instance by subsidizing staple food items
about <unk> of <unk> voters are believed to live near the poverty level
of the three candidates with a serious chance of winning <unk> <unk> comes closest to advocating the sort of measures that economists say n are necessary
but his inexperience raises doubts that he would have the political power to carry them out
the <unk> <unk> <unk> has been vague about his intentions and often inflammatory in his rhetoric but analysts say n he probably would be pragmatic
<unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> former factory worker and labor leader is the most radical vowing to withhold payments on the foreign debt and saying n he would n't go around putting the country up for sale to the highest bidder
but despite the differences in what they say according to some analysts here economic constraints mean <unk> the next president may not have many choices about what he does
hospital regulation sparks <unk>
which is the best medicine for runaway health costs competition or regulation
the question is at the root of a brawl between <unk> <unk> the big for - profit hospital and insurance company and its not - for-profit brethren in its home state of <unk>
the battle focuses on the state certificate - of-need law which regulates investment in new medical technology
the law has prevented n million of unnecessary expenditures since <unk> according to <unk> <unk> <unk> president of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
but according to <unk> <unk> <unk> chief executive it promotes technology monopolies stifles innovation and raises prices

the company complains that it paid n million to non - <unk> hospitals in its latest fiscal year for services provided to its insurance plan members
but <unk> says <unk> its own facilities could serve its insured for less if they were properly equipped
<unk> <unk> charges that <unk> own actions undermine its argument
when a hospital in <unk> installed a lithotripter last year demand for a similar kidney - stone smashing machine at a <unk> hospital in <unk> fell <unk>
the <unk> hospital responded by jacking up prices to make up for lost revenue <unk> <unk> says <unk> and now charges as much as <unk> for the procedure which costs only about <unk> in <unk>

debt - burdened doctors seek financial
health - care experts have long worried that young doctors emerging from medical school with a mountain of debt will choose careers in high - paying specialties instead of primary care where more physicians are needed most
now there a new wrinkle in what young doctors want more than half of n residents responding to recent survey said n they prefer a guaranteed salary over traditional fee - for-service compensation in their first professional position

the recently revived enthusiasm among small investors for stock mutual funds has been damped by a jittery stock market and the tumult over program trading
after hitting two - year highs this summer net sales of stock funds slowed in <unk> according to the <unk> <unk> <unk> a trade group
the sales recovery screeched to a halt this month some analysts say n
confidence was starting to come back because we did n't have wildly volatile days says <unk> <unk> research director for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> research firm
now everything such as program trading and wide stock market swings that everyone had pushed back in their consciousness is just sitting right there
net sales of stock funds in <unk> totaled n million down from <unk> billion in <unk> the institute said n
but if reinvested dividends are excluded investors put in only n million more than they pulled out for the month
<unk> numbers which wo n't be released for a month are down further mutual fund executives say n
investors in stock funds did n't panic the weekend after mid - <unk> n market plunge
most of the those who left stock funds simply switched into money market funds
and some fund groups said n investors actually became net buyers
but the stock market swings have continued
the recent outcry over program trading will cast a pall over the stock - fund environment in the coming months some analysts say n
the public is very close to having had it <unk> <unk> says
investors pulled back from bond funds in <unk> too
net sales of bond funds for the month totaled n billion down two - thirds from <unk> billion in <unk>
the major reason heavy outflows from high - risk high - yield junk bond funds
big withdrawals from the junk funds have continued this month
overall net sales of all mutual funds excluding money market funds fell to n billion in <unk> from n billion in <unk> the trade group said <unk>
small net inflows into stock and bond funds were offset by slight declines in the value of mutual fund stock and bond portfolios stemming from falling prices said <unk> <unk> <unk> the institute chief economist
many small investors went for the safety of money market funds
assets of these and other short - term funds surged more than n billion in <unk> the institute said n
analysts say n additional investors transferred their assets into money funds this month
at <unk> investments the nation largest fund group money funds continue to draw the most business says <unk> <unk> <unk> vice president marketing
in <unk> net sales of stock funds at <unk> dropped sharply <unk> <unk> said <unk>
but he emphasized that new accounts new sales inquiries and subsequent sales of stock funds are all up this month from <unk> level
investor interest in stock funds has n't stalled at all <unk> <unk> maintains n
he notes that most of the net sales drop stemmed from a three - day period following the <unk> the n plunge
if that follows through next month then it will be a different story he says
but <unk> <unk> adds n sales based on a few days events do n't tell you much about <unk> trends
one trend that continues is growth in the money invested in funds
buoyed by the continued inflows into money funds assets of all mutual funds swelled to a record n billion in <unk> up fractionally from <unk> billion in <unk>
stock - fund managers meantime went into <unk> with less cash on hand than they held earlier this year
these managers held <unk> of assets in cash at the end of <unk> down from <unk> in <unk> and <unk> in <unk> n
large cash positions help buffer funds from market declines but can cut down on gains in rising markets
managers of junk funds were bolstering their cash hoards after the <unk> cash crunch at <unk> <unk>
junk - portfolio managers raised their cash position to <unk> of assets in <unk> from <unk> in <unk>
in <unk> n that level was n
investors in all funds will seek safety in the coming months some analysts say n
among stock funds the conservative growth - and-income portfolios probably will remain popular fund specialists say n
there will be a continuation and possibly greater focus on conservative equity funds at the expense of growth and aggressive growth funds says <unk> <unk> an analyst at <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> fund - research concern
<unk> of <unk> <unk> we read <unk> decided to kill a speech that <unk> <unk> deputy national security adviser and a career soviet expert was going to give to a student colloquium the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
we keep wondering what <unk> <unk> wanted to say
perhaps he might have cited <unk> <unk> need for a stable currency free and competitive markets private property and real prices and other pie - in-the-sky reforms
perhaps he have called for a decentralized political and economic system without a dominant communist party
or political arrangements n to alleviate the grievances and demands of <unk> ethnic minorities and republics
why a <unk> <unk> might even have said nor are soviet problems susceptible to rescue from abroad through abundant western credits
if <unk> <unk> had been allowed to say these things we would now be hearing about discord and disarray on foreign policy
dark hints would be raised that parts of the administration hope <unk> <unk> <unk> would fail just as they were when <unk> <unk> <unk> voiced similar sentiments
it somehow ok for <unk> <unk> himself however to say all the same things
in fact he did the quotes above are from <unk> <unk> speech of two weeks ago
so far as we can see there is no disagreement among <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> n we read or for that matter <unk> <unk>
they all understand point one nothing <unk> the <unk> can do will make much difference in whether <unk> <unk> succeeds with perestroika
perhaps <unk> <unk> would emphasize more than <unk> <unk> the many hurdles n the soviet leader must leap if he is going to succeed
but everyone agrees that <unk> <unk> problems result from the failure of his own system
they can be relieved only by changing that system not by pouring western money into it
<unk> membership will not matter to <unk> coal miners short of soap nor will a <unk> treaty make any difference to ukrainian nationalists
on the other hand so long as <unk> <unk> is easing his grip on his empire everyone n we heard agrees that the <unk> can benefit by engaging him
if a deal can be made <unk> to cut the world ortegas loose from <unk> why not
we do n't expect much good from nuclear - arms control but conventional - arms talks might demilitarize <unk> <unk>
there nothing in the least contradictory in all this and it would be nice to think that <unk> could tolerate a reasonably sophisticated complex view
yet much of the political culture seems intent on castigating the <unk> administration for not helping <unk> <unk>
so every time n a <unk> official raises a doubt about <unk> <unk> the <unk> community shouts <unk> <unk> and timidity and an administration spokesman is quickly trotted out to reply <unk> <unk> wants perestroika to succeed
<unk> <unk> seems especially sensitive to the <unk> ailment known as <unk> - itis
its symptoms include a cold sweat at the sound of debate clammy hands in the face of congressional criticism and fainting spells when someone writes the word controversy
as one unidentified official clearly in the late stages of the disease told the <unk> <unk> just felt that there were some lines in the speech that could be misinterpreted and seized by the press
in short the problem is not intra - administration disagreement but preoccupation with the prospect that perestrokia might fail and its political opponents will ask who lost <unk>
<unk> <unk> may want to avoid criticism from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> but as <unk> of <unk> his audience is the entire free world not just <unk>
in any case he likely to find that the more he muzzles his colleagues the more leaks will pop up all around <unk> a lesson once learned by <unk> <unk>
letting officials express their own nuances can be educational
we note that in <unk> yesterday <unk> <unk> <unk> said that european euphoria over <unk> <unk> is starting to be tempered by a recognition of the magnitude of the problems n he was trying to deal with
it is in the western interest to see <unk> <unk> succeed
the odds are against him as he himself would no doubt tell you
the ultimate outcome depends on what he does not on what we do
even if the press is ready to seize and misinterpret these are not very complicated thoughts
surely there is someone in the administration maybe <unk> <unk> who could explain them to college students or even schoolchildren
<unk> <unk> <unk> was elected to the board of this transportation services concern
<unk> <unk> has served as executive director of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> director of the <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and attorney - consultant to the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
his election increases <unk> board to n members
the <unk> <unk> <unk> said n a seat was sold for <unk> down <unk> from the previous sale last <unk>
seats are currently quoted at <unk> bid and <unk> asked
two gunmen entered a <unk> restaurant ordered two employees to lie on the floor and shot them in the backs of their heads
the killers fled with less than n
describing this and other grisly killings <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> recently urged fellow lawmakers to revive a broad federal death penalty
the ultimate punishment he declared will protect the law - abiding from the vicious cruel individuals who commit these crimes
there just one problem the law that <unk> <unk> is pushing would be irrelevant in the case of the <unk> restaurant murders and almost all other killings
most murders are state crimes so any federal capital - punishment law probably would turn out to be more symbolism than substance
yet the bill is riding high on the furor over drug trafficking
<unk> republicans after repeatedly failing to attach death - penalty amendments to unrelated legislation have finally gotten a full - blown death - penalty bill through committee
the democratic leadership agreed to allow a floor vote on the issue before the end of the year a debate certain to focus on the alleged racial inequality of death sentencing
even some democrats concede that there is probably a majority in the <unk> that favors some kind of broad capital - punishment measure
the pending bill introduced by <unk> <unk> would revive the long - dormant federal death - penalty laws by instituting legal procedures required by the <unk> <unk>
in <unk> the high court swept aside all capital - punishment laws federal and state alike as unconstitutional
but in <unk> the court permitted resurrection of such laws if they meet certain procedural requirements
for instance juries would have to consider specific aggravating and mitigating factors before deciding whether to condemn someone to death
since that <unk> ruling n states have reintroduced the death penalty
but congressional democrats have blocked the same from occurring at the federal level with the exception of a n law allowing capital punishment for certain drug - related homicides
the <unk> bill would establish a federally administered death sentence for <unk> crimes most of which were formerly punishable by death under federal statutes that the <unk> <unk> invalidated
among these crimes are murder on federal land presidential assassination and espionage
the <unk> bill would also add five new crimes punishable by death including murder for hire
separately the <unk> last week passed a bill permitting execution of terrorists who kill americans abroad
amid the swirl of punitive rhetoric surrounding the issue one critical question involves whether a federal death penalty on top of existing state laws would deter any would - be criminals
for one thing it unlikely that many people would receive federal death sentences let alone be executed
most of the crimes incorporated in the <unk> bill are exceedingly rare killing a <unk> <unk> justice for instance or deliberately causing a train wreck that results in a death
in fact only <unk> defendants would have been eligible for federal death sentences if the <unk> bill had been in effect in the past three years according to a study by the <unk> <unk> <unk> democratic staff
the last federal execution before the <unk> <unk> n ruling banning the death penalty took place in <unk> meaning that the federal government did n't exercise its execution authority for eight years
in that sense the whole debate is sort of a fraud argues a democratic <unk> staff member
it distracting attention from serious issues like how to make <unk> <unk> and <unk> work together on drug enforcement
republicans acknowledge that few people would be executed under the <unk> bill but they contend <unk> that is n't the point
many scholars are of the opinion that the mere existence of the penalty deters many people from the commission of capital crimes says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
executions regardless of how frequently they occur are also proper retribution for heinous crimes <unk> <unk> argues <unk>
<unk> <unk> a senior <unk> <unk> official says <unk> the new federal drug - related crimes punishable by death since last <unk> may result in a jump in capital sentences though that has n't happened so far
in addition to resuscitating the old issue of whether death sentences deter criminals this bill has made race a major part of the death - penalty debate
before the bill left committee <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> attached an amendment that would allow a defendant to escape from a death sentence in jurisdictions shown to have meted out executions in a racist manner
the amendment prompted an ironic protest from <unk> <unk> who complained that it would kill capital punishment
a large number of studies suggest that state judges and juries have imposed the penalty in a racially discriminatory fashion
and the <unk> amendment would invade not only federal but state sentencings in two important ways
it would allow all defendants to introduce statistical evidence showing racially disproportionate application of the death penalty in the past
and it would shift the burden to prosecutors to disprove that discrimination caused any statistical racial disparities
that burden is very difficult if not impossible n to meet says <unk> <unk>
how do you prove a negative
since most prosecutors would n't be able to demonstrate conclusively that racial considerations did n't affect sentencing executions everywhere might come to a halt <unk> <unk> explains <unk>
at least n major studies purport to show that particular states have imposed the death penalty disproportionately against killers of whites compared with blacks and against black defendants compared with white defendants
conservatives question the validity of the studies and note that the <unk> <unk> ruled in <unk> that such research regardless of its accuracy is n't relevant to a constitutional attack on a particular death sentence
the <unk> amendment would in effect legislate around the <unk> <unk> ruling
lawyers would eagerly seize on the provision in their death - penalty appeals says <unk> <unk> director of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> capital - punishment defense team
<unk> <unk> failed to get his amendment incorporated into last year anti - drug legislation and it will be severely attacked on the <unk> floor this time around
but if it survives it could prompt other statutory changes according to the <unk> <unk>
it might force <unk> and the states to narrow the death penalty only to convictions shown to be relatively free of racial imbalance murders by repeat offenders who torture their victims perhaps
narrowing the penalty in this fashion would clearly reduce whatever deterrent effect it now has
and that in turn would only strengthen the argument of those who oppose execution under any circumstances
a state judge postponed a decision on a move by holders of <unk> <unk> n to block the tender offer of <unk> <unk> <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> <unk> it does n't already own

nothing was going to hold up the long - delayed settlement of <unk> vs. <unk>

on the afternoon of <unk> n after hours of haggling with five insurance - claims adjusters over settling a toxic - waste suit four lawyers had an agreement in hand
but as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> donned his robes so he could give final approval the major earthquake struck its epicenter not far from his courtroom in <unk> <unk> <unk>
the walls shook the building rocked
for a while it looked like the deal not to mention the courtroom itself was on the verge of collapse
the judge came out and said <unk> let put this on the record says <unk> <unk> the judge court reporter
i said now
i was shaking the whole time
a n water cooler had toppled onto the floor soaking the red carpeting
lights flickered on and off plaster dropped from the ceiling the walls still shook and an evacuation alarm blared outside
the four lawyers climbed out from under a table
let close the door said the judge as he climbed to his bench
at stake was an n settlement involving who should pay what share of cleanup costs at the site of a former gas station where underground fuel tanks had leaked and contaminated the soil
and the lawyers were just as eager as the judge to wrap it up
we were never going to get these insurance companies to agree again says <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> defense lawyer in the case
indeed the insurance adjusters had already bolted out of the courtroom
the lawyers went to work anyway duly noting that the proceeding was taking place during a major earthquake
ten minutes later it was done
for the record <unk> <unk> an attorney for <unk> <unk> said <unk> he was rattled both literally and figuratively
my belief is always <unk> if you got a settlement you read it into the record says <unk> <unk> now known in his courthouse as <unk> <unk> <unk>
the insurance adjusters think differently
i did n't know if it was <unk> <unk> <unk> or what says <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>

indeed the art of doctoring does contribute to better health results and discourages unwarranted malpractice litigation
elaborating on the concern about doctors sacrificing earnings in order to spend talk time with patients we are finding n the quality of the time spent is the key to true rapport
even brief conversations can show caring and trust and need not restrict the efficiency of the communication or restrain the doctor earnings
the issue is far - reaching
right now the american populace is spending about n of our gross national product on health care
that amounts to more than n billion a year
and it is estimated that more than <unk> of that n billion goes to defensive medicine those measures taken by doctors to protect themselves from the most unlikely possibilities

in an interview with the trade journal <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> declined to say which plants will close or when <unk> will make the moves
but he said we have too many plants in our system
so the older or most inefficient capacity has got to go
according to industry analysts <unk> plants most likely to close are the <unk> <unk> no . n facility which builds <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> models the <unk> <unk> <unk> plant which dates back to the early n and two canadian plants that build the <unk> <unk> and <unk> full - sized vans

at <unk> <unk> model preview last month <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> the no . n auto maker along with other <unk> manufacturers might be forced to realign capacity if market demand does n't improve
but <unk> <unk> remarks are the most specific indication to date of how many plants could be in jeopardy
<unk> motors <unk> has signaled that as many as five of its <unk> and canadian plants may not survive the n as it struggles to trim its excess vehicle - production capacity
the overcapacity problem has intensified in recent years with foreign auto makers beginning car and truck production in the <unk>
with companies such as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> running so - called transplant auto operations japanese auto production in the <unk> will reach one million vehicles this year
unless the market goes to n million units which we all know n it not going to do we have the inescapable fact that the transplants are adding capacity <unk> <unk> said last month
the japanese - managed plants eventually will have the capacity to build some n million vehicles in the <unk> and that will translate into market share that is going to have to come out of somebody he added n
already <unk> has closed the <unk> <unk> plant n it acquired when it bought <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>
<unk> has also launched a n billion cost - cutting program that will cut about <unk> white - collar workers from the payroll in the next few months
<unk> <unk> <unk> the drugstore chain that filed for bankruptcy - court protection last year received a n million offer from a group led by <unk> billionaire <unk> <unk>
<unk> reacted cautiously saying n the plan would add n million of new debt to the highly leveraged company
it was <unk> huge debt from its n billion leveraged buy - out in <unk> that forced it to seek protection under chapter n of the federal <unk> <unk>
<unk> insists that the proposal is simply an expression of interest because under chapter <unk> <unk> has exclusivity rights until <unk> n
those rights prevent anyone other than <unk> from proposing a reorganization plan
also under chapter <unk> a reorganization plan is subject to approval by bondholders banks and other creditors
a financial adviser for <unk> bondholders <unk> <unk> of <unk> partners had mixed reactions to the offer
he said <unk> he feared n a <unk> reorganization might force bondholders to accept a cheap deal and that the <unk> group offer would give them more money
however the group is offering to pay off bondholders in cash only n million and no equity
the <unk> bonds are high - yield high - risk junk bonds holders have n million in claims against <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk>
<unk> received the offer <unk> <unk> but issued a response yesterday only after a copy of the proposal was made public by bondholders
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> partnership that includes the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> made the proposal
<unk> <unk> is based in <unk> <unk>
analysts said n the nation second - largest drugstore chain was a valuable company despite its financial woes
its problem they say is that management paid too much in the leveraged buy - out and the current n million debt load is keeping <unk> in the red
if bought at the right price it could still be profitable said <unk> <unk> an analyst at <unk> <unk> <unk>
in addition <unk> <unk> stores in n states represent a lot of real estate he said n and demographics are helping pharmacies the nation aging population will boost demand for prescription drugs

copper futures prices failed to extend <unk> rally
declines came because of concern that demand for copper may slow down
the <unk> contract was down three cents a pound settling at <unk> which was just above the day low of <unk>
futures prices fell during three of five sessions last week and the losses individually and cumulatively were greater than the advances
two of the major factors buoying prices the prolonged strikes at the <unk> <unk> mine in <unk> and the <unk> mine in <unk> were finally resolved
also the premiums paid by the <unk> government on a purchase of copper for the <unk> <unk> were lower than expected and acted as a price depressant analysts said n
the mint purchases were at premiums about n n cents a pound above the respective prices for the copper
at the time merchants were asking for premiums of about five cents a pound
all this has led to prolonged selling in futures mostly on the part of computer - guided funds
prices fell through levels regarded as important support areas which added to the selling
the reluctance of traders to buy contracts indicates that they have begun focusing on demand rather than supply
at least one analyst noted that as production improves the concern among traders is whether the prospective increased supply will find buyers because of uncertainty over national economies
demand from <unk> is expected to continue strong but not from other areas of the world into the first quarter of next year he said
<unk> normally depends heavily on the <unk> <unk> and <unk> mines as well as the <unk> mine in <unk> <unk> <unk>
recently <unk> has been buying copper elsewhere
but as <unk> <unk> and <unk> begin operating they are expected to resume their roles as <unk> suppliers
according to <unk> <unk> metals economist for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has already started operating and <unk> is expected to do so soon
the <unk> mine is generally expected to remain closed until at least the end of the year
it has n't been operating since <unk> <unk> because of attacks by native landowners
a recent attempt to resume operations was cut short quickly by these attacks
however traders disregarded a potential production disruption in <unk> and a continued drop in inventories
workers at two chilean mines <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> which belong to the <unk> - owned <unk> <unk> group will vote <unk> on whether to strike after a two - year labor pact ends today
the mines produced a total of n tons of copper in <unk>
according to <unk> <unk> <unk> the potential strike is expected to be resolved quickly which may be one reason why the situation did n't affect prices much
another analyst said that if there was any concern it was that a strike could encourage other walkouts in <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> copper inventories fell <unk> tons last week to n tons a smaller - than-expected decline
but that development also had little effect on traders sentiment
<unk> <unk> said that stocks of copper in <unk> producers hands at the end of <unk> were down n metric tons from <unk> to n tons
outside the <unk> he said <unk> producer stocks at the end of <unk> were <unk> tons down <unk> tons from the end of <unk>
consumer stocks of copper in the <unk> fell to <unk> tons at the end of <unk> from <unk> tons a month earlier and stocks of copper held by consumers and merchants outside of the <unk> at the end of <unk> stood at <unk> tons down from <unk> tons in <unk>
the high point of foreigners copper stocks this year was n tons at the end of <unk> according to <unk> <unk>
in other commodity markets yesterday
grains and soybeans
the prices of most corn soybean and wheat futures contracts dropped slightly as farmers in the <unk> continued to rebuild stockpiles that were depleted by the <unk> drought
buying by the soviets has helped to prop up corn prices in recent weeks but a lack of any new purchases kept prices in the doldrums
coffee
futures prices rose slightly in a market filled with rumors that a new international coffee agreement might still be achieved
the <unk> contract ended with a gain of <unk> cents a pound at n cents
according to one analyst prices opened higher because of reports over the weekend that <unk> and <unk> at the <unk> - <unk> summit meeting in <unk> <unk> had agreed to a reduction in their coffee export quotas for the sake of creating a new agreement
the reports attributed to the colombian minister of economic development said <unk> <unk> would give up n bags of its quota and <unk> <unk> bags the analyst said <unk>
these reports were later denied by a high brazilian official who said <unk> <unk> was n't involved in any coffee discussions on quotas the analyst said <unk>
the colombian minister was said to have referred to a letter that he said <unk> <unk> <unk> sent to colombian <unk> <unk> <unk> and in which <unk> <unk> said <unk> it was possible to overcome obstacles to a new agreement
the minister was also quoted as saying that a new pact could be achieved during the first half of next year according to the analyst

the market turned quiet after rising sharply late last week according to one analyst
last week uncertainty in the stock market and a weaker dollar triggered a flight to safety he said n but yesterday the market lacked such stimuli
there was some profit - taking because prices for all the precious metals had risen to levels at which there was resistance to further advance he said n
the dollar was also slightly firmer and prompted some selling as well according to the analyst

when the <unk> <unk> passed laws on workers rights in <unk> <unk> and on self - managing cooperatives a year later some western observers assumed <unk> <unk> <unk> had launched the <unk> <unk> on a course that would lead inevitably to the creation of a market economy
their only doubt concerned the possibility that <unk> <unk> might not survive the opposition that his reforms would arouse and that the whole process might be reversed
if <unk> <unk> goal is the creation of a free market he and these western observers have good reason n to fear for his future as economic liberalization within communist societies leads inexorably to demands for fundamental political reform accompanied by civil unrest
these fears were clearly apparent when last week <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> blocked a speech by <unk> <unk> deputy national security adviser and soviet expert on the ground that it was too pessimistic about the chances of <unk> <unk> economic reforms succeeding
yet the soviet leader readiness to embark on foreign visits and steady accumulation of personal power particularly since the last <unk> reshuffle on <unk> n do not suggest that <unk> <unk> is on the verge of being toppled nor does he look likely to reverse the powers of perestroika
indeed the soviet miners strike this summer clearly demonstrated that <unk> <unk> must proceed with economic reform
but is he so clever that he has achieved the political equivalent of making water run uphill
and has he truly persuaded the <unk> <unk> to accept economic change of a kind that will sooner or later lead to its demise
an alternative and more convincing explanation confirmed by recent events and a close inspection of the <unk> program is that the new soviet economic and social structures are intended to conform to a model other than that of the market
for example while the laws on individual labor activity allow a citizen to earn a living independent of the state strict provisions are attached on how far this may lead to the development of a free market
before becoming self - employed or setting up a cooperative workers must seek permission from the local soviet council
permission is far from automatic the soviets have the legal right to turn down applications and impose conditions and they appear to be exercising these powers
private dressmaking for example is allowed in <unk> soviet republics but banned by five shoemaking is allowed in seven but illegal in nine
the controls on cooperatives appeared relatively liberal when first introduced
but that changed following a resolution from the <unk> <unk> banning cooperatives from operating in some areas of the economy and permitting activity in others only if the cooperatives are under contract to the state
all independent media activity is now illegal which perhaps is not surprising but so is the manufacture of perfume cosmetics household chemicals and sand candles
medical cooperatives among the most successful in the <unk> are banned from providing general - practitioner services their main source of income carrying out surgery and treating cancer patients drug addicts and pregnant women
earlier this month the <unk> <unk> adopted two more resolutions restricting the freedom of cooperatives the first enables the soviets to set prices for which goods may be sold the second bans cooperatives from buying industrial and food goods from the state or other cooperatives
if <unk> <unk> is looking toward unleashing the productive forces of the market these latest resolutions are nothing short of reckless
along with some other revealing indicators these developments suggest that while <unk> <unk> wishes to move away from some rigid central controls he is bent on creating economic structures of a kind that would scarcely find favor with the austrian or <unk> schools of economic thought
<unk> <unk> has ruled out the use of the market to solve the problem of insufficient consumer goods
he told the <unk> of people deputies on <unk> <unk> we do not share this approach since it would immediately destroy the social situation and disrupt all the processes in the country
having rejected central economic planning for economic reasons and the market for fear of the social political consequences <unk> <unk> seeks a third way that would combine the discipline and controls of the former with the economic benefits of the latter
most important this would leave the party intact and its monopoly of political power largely undisturbed
indeed <unk> <unk> proposals display a close conceptual resemblance to the tenets of italian fascism whose architects spoke specifically of a third way of having produced a historic synthesis of socialism and capitalism
they too promised to combine economic efficiency with order and discipline
the emergence of russian corporatism had been anticipated in journalist <unk> <unk> introduction to a series of colloquies can the soviet system <unk> <unk> published this spring
<unk> will reach its final stage of development in a feckless <unk> corporation - socialist in form nationalistic in content and oriental in style that will puzzle the world with alternating feats of realism and recklessness
the fascist concept of corporatism envisaged an organic society in which citizens were spiritually and morally unified and prepared to sacrifice themselves for the nation
this unification was to be brought about through policies and institutions that would unite workers and employers with government in a fully integrated and harmonic society
the key to the creation of the organic state lay in the formation of natural groups that would undertake the role of decision - making
by contrast a parliamentary system based on abstract political rights and groups was held to cause rather than resolve conflict
the closeness of soviet perestroika to the fascist social blueprint of <unk> was evident when <unk> <unk> presented his economic vision to the <unk> <unk>
in doing so he neither rejected a socialist planned economy nor embraced the free market
instead he proposed a law - governed economy in which there would be a clear - cut division between state direction of the economy and economic management
the latter would be undertaken by enterprises joint stock companies and cooperatives
these would not function independently but would act together to form combines unions and associations <unk> to tackle problems and coordinate their activities
<unk> <unk> is in a much stronger position n to pursue the corporatist ideal than was <unk> who was never able to influence business giants such as <unk> and <unk>
the <unk> <unk> <unk> has the power to shape corporate development and mold it into a body dependent upon it
to ensure the loyalty of the business sector <unk> <unk> may offer concessions and powers that will allow the business community to preserve its own interests probably by restricting competition
however <unk> <unk> must ensure that within this alliance the business sector remains subordinate to the party
at the same time he must give it sufficient freedom n to provide the economic benefits so desperately needed
it is the promise of economic returns that is supposed to make the corporatist model attractive to both the party and labor
the work force provides the third arm of the alliance
within the alliance it is supposed to act as a balancing force guarding against excessive control by government or abuse of its economic position by business for either could result in a deterioration of its living standards under the new resolutions workers councils may demand that a cooperative be closed or its prices be reduced
by providing workers with the opportunity to move into the private sector where wages tend to be higher and by holding out the promise of more consumer goods <unk> <unk> hopes to revive the popularity of the party
at the same time the strategy requires that he deal effectively with those who seek genuine western - style political pluralism
the most important development in <unk> <unk> policy for marginalizing the opposition movement is the claim that the <unk> also suffers from terrorism
an increasing number of references by the soviet press to opposition groups now active in the <unk> particularly the <unk> <unk> allege that they show terroristic tendencies and claim that they would be prepared to kill in order to achieve their aims
it is possible that in perpetuating such myths the ground is being laid for the arrest of opposition activists on the ground of terrorism
<unk> <unk> would appear to see his central task however as that of ensuring that foundations of an alliance among labor capital and the state are properly laid before the demands for a multiparty system reach a crescendo
if he were able to construct a popular and efficient corporatist system he or his heir would be wellplaced to rein in political opposition and to re - establish control in <unk> <unk>
the weaknesses in his plan do not lie in the political calculations <unk> <unk> is a consummate political leader perhaps one of the greatest but in its economic prescription
contrary to widespread belief <unk> failed to live up to his promise to make the trains run on time it is doubtful whether soviet - style corporatism will make soviet trains run on time or fill the shops with goods that the consumers so desperately crave

new construction contracting climbed n in <unk> to an annualized n billion with commercial industrial and public - works contracts providing most of the increase according to <unk> <unk> <unk>
through the first nine months of the year the unadjusted total of all new construction was n billion flat compared with a year earlier
the <unk> was off <unk> after the first nine months while the <unk> <unk> region was up <unk>
the <unk> and west regions were unchanged
a small decline in total construction for the entire year is possible if contracting for housing does n't increase in response to this year lower mortgage rates said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> vice president and chief economist of <unk> the forecasting division of publisher <unk> - <unk> <unk>
the seasonally adjusted <unk> <unk> reached <unk> in <unk> its highest level this year from <unk> in <unk>
the index uses a base of <unk> in <unk>
newly contracted residential work edged up <unk> in <unk> to an annualized n billion largely because multifamily building rebounded from a very weak <unk>
at the end of the third quarter there was still no evidence of renewed home building in response to the midyear decline of mortgage rates <unk> <unk> said
housing has been weak all year and especially so in the past five months
contracting for non - residential buildings rose n in <unk> to an annualized n billion
commercial and industrial construction rose sharply partly because of three large projects each expected to cost more than n million
institutional building such as hospitals and schools eased in <unk> following a surge in <unk>
although the third quarter was the best so far this year for non - residential building weakness early in the year held the nine - month total to n billion up just n from a year earlier
public - works and utility projects also known as non - building contracting grew <unk> to n billion in <unk> but the nine - month total of n billion was down n from a year earlier
the <unk> <unk> end of the federal fiscal year may have prodded contractors to get any behind - schedule road and bridge construction under way before the clock ran out <unk> <unk> said <unk> referring to threatened n across - the-board budget cuts
a <unk> construction contract values are reported on an annualized seasonally adjusted basis
<unk> investors <unk> <unk> said n it lowered ratings on long - term debt of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the holding company of <unk> <unk> giant <unk> <unk> <unk> because of <unk> <unk> aggressive merchant banking risk in highly leveraged takeovers
in downgrading <unk> <unk> <unk> subordinated domestic <unk> and swiss debt to <unk> from <unk> <unk> is matching a move made by the other major credit rating concern <unk> <unk> <unk> several months ago
<unk> also confirmed the <unk> rating its highest on <unk> <unk> <unk> commercial paper or short - term corporate ious
in addition <unk> said <unk> it downgraded <unk> <unk> <unk> - <unk> <unk> senior and subordinated swiss debt to <unk> from <unk> and lowered <unk> <unk> <unk> junior subordinated perpetual eurodebt guaranteed by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> from <unk>
about n million of long - term debt is affected according to <unk>
a spokesman for <unk> <unk> <unk> said we remain committed to a full range of businesses including merchant banking
we think that the ratings revision is unfortunate but not unexpected
our commitment to manage these businesses profitably will continue
<unk> <unk> merchant banking risks mounted last month as highly leveraged <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> most lucrative client of the decade was hit by a cash squeeze and the high - risk junk bond market tumbled
<unk> <unk> incurred millions of dollars of losses on <unk> securities n it owned as well as on special securities n it could n't sell
<unk> <unk> financings for several other highly leveraged clients including <unk> <unk> unraveled as the high - risk junk bond market plummeted
<unk> said <unk> its rating changes actions reflect <unk> <unk> <unk> aggressive merchant banking risk as well as the risk profile of its current merchant banking exposures
it said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has consistently been one of the most aggressive firms in merchant banking and that a very significant portion of the firm profit in recent years has come from merchant banking - related business
<unk> believes that the uncertain environment for merchant banking could put pressure on <unk> <unk> <unk> performance the rating concern said citing continued problems from the firm exposures to various <unk> - related firms and to <unk> <unk>
these two exposures alone represent a very substantial portion of <unk> <unk> <unk> equity <unk> said
total merchant banking exposures are in excess of the firm equity
<unk> <unk> <unk> plans to cut about <unk> or <unk> of its <unk> employees over the next several months
this action will continue to keep operating expenses in line with revenue said <unk> <unk> <unk> president and chief executive officer of <unk> <unk> - based <unk>
the move by the financial information and services subsidiary of <unk> is a response to changing conditions in the retail securities industry which has been contracting since <unk> n stock market crash the executive added n
<unk> which <unk> purchased in <unk> provides price quotations for securities particularly stocks
<unk> also provides trading and other systems services for brokerage firms and communications - network services
independent providers of financial information including <unk> have been under some pressure as the major securities houses try to regain their hold on the production of market data and on the related revenue
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> are discussing formation of a group n to sell securities - price data
the job cuts n to be made in a number of areas at various job levels are a streamlining of operations a spokeswoman said n
the company has no immediate plans to close any operations she said n but <unk> may subcontract some work that it has been doing in - house including refurbishment and production of <unk> <unk> equipment used in delivering financial data
the spokeswoman said n the move is n't directly a response to <unk> loss of its two biggest customers <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> earlier this year
the spokeswoman noted that last week <unk> <unk> <unk> the securities subsidiary of <unk> <unk> <unk> chose a <unk> subsidiary n to provide order - processing services

<unk> is n't profitable on <unk> books because of the interest charges n the <unk> <unk> bank holding company incurred in buying the financial - data concern for n million says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> analyst for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
but <unk> does view <unk> as being crucial to the financial - services business in the <unk> the analyst added <unk>
this past summer <unk> sold its customer - service unit employing <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> a closely held computer - service firm in <unk> <unk> <unk>
terms were n't disclosed
the <unk> <unk> four - game sweep over the <unk> <unk> giants in the <unk> <unk> may widen already - sizable losses that the <unk> network will incur on the current final year of its baseball contract
the <unk> <unk> disrupted by a devastating earthquake and diminished in national interest because both teams came from the <unk> <unk> <unk> area is likely to end up as the lowest - rated <unk> of this decade and probably since the event has been broadcast
the first three games were seen by an average of only <unk> of <unk> homes a sharp decline from the <unk> rating for last year <unk>
a final ratings tally from <unk> <unk> <unk> is due today
the sweep by the <unk> 's whose pitchers and home - run hitters dominated the injury - prone <unk> will only make things worse for <unk> owned by <unk> <unk> <unk>
the network had been expected to have losses of as much as n million on baseball this year
it is n't clear how much those losses may widen because of the short series
had the contest gone a full seven games <unk> could have reaped an extra n million in ad sales on the seventh game alone compared with the ad take <unk> it would have received for regular prime - time shows
<unk> had based its budget for baseball on a six - game <unk>
a network spokesman would n't comment and <unk> <unk> officials declined to be interviewed
but some industry executives said <unk> <unk> in anticipation of a four - game sweep limited its losses by jacking up the number of commercials n it aired in the third and fourth games
a <unk> <unk> telecast typically carries <unk> n commercials but by the fourth game <unk> was cramming in <unk> to n ads to generate extra revenue
<unk> baseball experience may be of interest to <unk> <unk> which next season takes over the broadcasting of all baseball playoffs in a four - year television contract priced at n billion
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has conceded only that <unk> will have a loss in the first year
but other industry executives contend <unk> the losses could reach <unk> million over four years and could go even higher if the <unk> <unk> end in four - game romps
the <unk> typically is among the highest - rated sports events on television
last year series broadcast by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was the lowest - rated <unk> in four years instead of featuring a major <unk> <unk> team against a <unk> <unk> team it pitted the <unk> <unk> dodgers against the losing <unk> <unk> 's
<unk> hurdle was even higher this year with two teams from the same area
the <unk> got off to a lukewarm start <unk> n with a n rating the next night it drew <unk> of homes
then came the earthquake and a damaging delay of <unk> days
some people had hoped <unk> <unk> ratings would go up because of the intense focus on the event in the aftermath of the earthquake
an analyst opinion to that effect even sent <unk> <unk> shares soaring two weeks ago
but interest instead decreased
the third game last <unk> night drew a disappointing n rating
bargain hunters helped stock prices break a weeklong losing streak while bond prices and the dollar inched higher
the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> gained <unk> points to <unk> in light trading after losing more than <unk> points last week
bond prices continued to edge higher in anticipation of more news showing a slower economy
although the dollar rose slightly against most major currencies the focus in currency markets was on the beleaguered british pound which gained slightly against the dollar
trading volume on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> dwindled to only n million shares yesterday as major brokerage firms continued to throw in the towel on program trading
<unk> <unk> became the most recent firm n to swear off stock - index arbitrage trading for its own account and <unk> <unk> late yesterday took the major step of renouncing the trading strategy even for its clients
yet that did n't eliminate program trading from the market
the <unk> industrials shot up n points in the opening hour at least in part because of buy programs generated by stock - index arbitrage a form of program trading involving futures contracts
but interest waned as the day wore on and investors looked ahead to the release later this week of two important economic reports
the first is <unk> survey of purchasing managers considered a good indicator of how the nation manufacturing sector fared in <unk>
the other is <unk> measure of <unk> employment an indicator of the broader economy health
both are expected to show continued sluggishness which would be good for bonds and bad for stocks
in major market activity <unk> prices rose in light trading
but declining issues on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> outnumbered gainers <unk> to <unk> and broader market indexes were virtually unchanged
bond prices crept higher
the <unk> benchmark <unk> bond gained about an eighth of a point or about n for each <unk> face amount
the yield on the issue slipped to <unk>
the dollar gained
in late <unk> <unk> trading the dollar was quoted at n marks and n yen compared with n marks and n yen <unk>
the british pound pressured by last week resignations of key <unk> administration officials nevertheless rose <unk> to <unk> from <unk> <unk>
if japanese companies are so efficient why does <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> sometimes need a week just to tell its clients how soon it can ship goods from here to <unk>
why until last spring did the <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> sometimes take several days to correct typographical errors in its paper work for international transactions
because the companies have lacked office computers considered standard equipment in the <unk> and <unk> <unk> japanese corporations reputation as hi - tech powerhouses is only half right
their factories may look like sets for a <unk> movie but their offices with rows of clerks hunched over ledgers and abacuses are more like scenes from a <unk> novel
now the personal - computer revolution is finally reaching <unk>
<unk> - <unk> a freight company set up its own software subsidiary this year and is spending nearly a year profit to more than double the computer terminals at its main office
in <unk> the <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> linked its computers in <unk> with its three american offices
overall pc sales in <unk> in the first half of <unk> were <unk> higher than in the year - earlier period
combined pc and work - station use in <unk> will jump as much as <unk> annually over the next five years according to some analysts compared with about <unk> in the <unk>
and with a labor shortage and intense competitive pressure to improve efficiency more and more japanese companies are concluding that they have no choice
we have too many people in our home offices says <unk> <unk> the president of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
productivity in japanese offices is relatively low
with japanese companies in a wide range of industries from heavy industry to securities firms increasing their market share world - wide the prospect of an even more efficient japanese economic army may rattle foreigners
but it also offers opportunities americans are well poised to supply the weapons
<unk> may be a tough market <unk> for outsiders to penetrate and the <unk> is hopelessly behind <unk> in certain technologies
but for now at least americans are far better at making pcs and the software that runs them
after years of talking about selling in <unk> more and more <unk> companies are seriously pouring in
<unk> <unk> <unk> has doubled its staff here over the past year
<unk> <unk> <unk> has slashed the lag between <unk> and <unk> product introductions to six months from three years
<unk> - <unk> <unk> has a bigger share of the computer - network market in <unk> than at home
but the japanese have to go a long way to catch up
typical is one office of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> the main bureaucracy overseeing the computer industry
<unk> <unk> yearbooks are lined up on nearly every desk and dog - eared copies of <unk> <unk> crowd magazine racks
but amid the two dozen bureaucrats and secretaries sits only one real - life pc
while american pc sales have averaged roughly <unk> annual growth since <unk> and <unk> european sales a whopping n japanese sales were flat for most of that time
japanese office workers use pcs at half the rate of their european counterparts and one - third that of the americans
moreover japanese offices tend to use computers less efficiently than american offices do
in the <unk> pcs commonly perform many tasks and plug into a broad network
in <unk> many desktop terminals are limited to one function and ca n't communicate with other machines
the market planning and sales promotion office of <unk> securities <unk> for example has more than n computers for its n workers a respectable ratio
but the machines are n't on employees desks they ring the perimeter of the large office
some machines make charts for presentations
others analyze the data
to transfer information from one to the other employees make printouts and enter the data manually
to transmit charts to branch offices they use a fax machine
meanwhile a woman sitting next to a new <unk> terminal writes stock - market information on a chart with a pencil and adds it up with a hand calculator
in an efficient setup the same pc could perform all those tasks
in the <unk> more than half the pc software sold is either for spreadsheets or for database analysis according to <unk>
in <unk> those functions account for only about a third of the software market
machines dedicated solely to word processing which have all but disappeared in the <unk> are still more common in <unk> than pcs
in the <unk> one - fifth of the office pcs are hooked up to some sort of network
in <unk> about <unk> are linked
computers here are used for data gathering says <unk> <unk> <unk> who manages the integrated - technologies group in <unk> <unk> <unk> office
some japanese operations such as securities - trading rooms may be ahead of their american counterparts he says <unk> but basically there little analysis done on computers in <unk>
of course simply buying computers does n't always solve problems and many american companies have erred by purchasing technology n they did n't understand
but healthy skepticism is only a small reason for <unk> <unk> lag
various cultural and economic forces have suppressed demand
because the japanese alphabet is so huge <unk> has no history of typewriter use and so keyboard allergy especially among older workers remains a common affliction
i have no experience before with such sophisticated machinery says <unk> <unk> a <unk> executive vice president of <unk> <unk> <unk> explaining his reluctance before accepting a terminal in his office this summer
while most american employees have their own private space <unk> salarymen usually share large common tables and rely heavily on old - fashioned personal contact
top japanese executives often make decisions based on consensus and personal relationships rather than complex financial projections and fancy presentations
and <unk> management system makes it hard to impose a single integrated computer system corporatewide
besides a computer processing the japanese language needs a huge memory and much processing capability while the screen and printer need far better definition to depict accurately the intricate symbols
until recently much of the necessary technology has been unavailable or at least unaffordable
some analysts estimate <unk> the average pc costs about n more in <unk> than the <unk>
but the complex language is n't the only reason
for the past decade <unk> <unk> has owned more than half the japanese pc market and ruled it with near - monopoly power
with little competition the computer industry here is inefficient
the <unk> market too is dominated by a giant <unk> <unk> machines <unk>
but early on <unk> offered its basic design to anybody wanting to copy it
dozens of small companies did swiftly establishing a standard operating system
that spurs competition and growth allows users to change and mix brands easily and increases software firms incentive to write packages because they can be sold to users of virtually any computer
if a record industry lacked a common standard <unk> cd owners could listen to a <unk> version of <unk> like a prayer but not one made for a <unk> player
that is the state of <unk> computer industry
<unk> wo n't release its code and every one of the dozen or so makers has its own proprietary operating system all incompatible with each other
<unk> established its standard to try to stop falling behind upstart <unk> <unk> but <unk> was ahead from the start and did n't need to invite in competitive allies
meanwhile the big players have n't tried to copy the <unk> standard
corporate pride as well as the close ties common among japanese manufacturers help explain why
most rivals have a working relationship with <unk> often through cross - licensing of technology the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> noted <unk> recently
they hesitate to market <unk> - compatible machines <unk> disapproves of such machines and marketing one would jeopardize their relationship
the result according to many analysts is higher prices and less innovation
while tens of thousands of software packages using the <unk> standard are available in the <unk> they say <unk> only about n are written for <unk>
a year ago <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> warned <unk> about possible violations of anti - monopoly laws for discouraging retailers from discounting
in <unk> software is four to five years behind the <unk> because hardware is four to five years behind because <unk> is enjoying a monopoly complains <unk> <unk> <unk> the president of <unk> <unk> one of <unk> leading <unk> - magazine publishing and software companies
there are no price wars no competition
an <unk> spokeswoman responds that prices are higher in <unk> because customers put a greater emphasis on quality and service than they do in the <unk>
she adds that some technological advances trail those in the <unk> because the japanese still import basic operating systems from american companies
but the market is changing
the government is funding several projects to push pc use
over the next three years public schools will get n million pcs a <unk> increase from current levels
in the private sector practically every major company is setting explicit goals to increase employees exposure to computers
<unk> <unk> <unk> sales offices in <unk> have one - tenth the computers per employee that its own <unk> offices do over the next five years it is aiming for rough parity
within a year <unk> <unk> a major cosmetics company plans to eliminate n clerical jobs by putting on a central computer network some work such as credit reports currently performed in n separate offices
by increasing the number of pcs n it uses from <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> hopes not only to make certain tasks easier but also to transform the way n the company is run
managers have long been those who supervise their subordinates so orders would be properly acted on a spokesman says
but new managers will have to be creators and innovators and for that purpose it is necessary to create an environment where information from both inside and outside the company can be reached easily and also shared
meanwhile more computer makers now are competing for the new business
<unk> <unk> <unk> a newcomer to the industry fought off a legal challenge and started selling <unk> clones last year
it has won about n of the retail pc market
<unk> <unk> which temporarily dropped out of the pc business three years ago started selling its work station in <unk> and quickly became the leading japanese company in that market
in a country where elbow room is scarce laptop machines will take a large portion of the industry future growth
<unk> <unk> busted open that sector this summer with a notebook - sized machine that retails for less than <unk> yen under n one of the smallest cheapest pcs available in the country
<unk> <unk> is lavishing the most expensive promotion campaign in its history including a n bash at <unk> <unk> for its sophisticated sound\/graphics <unk> <unk> machine which it advertises for everything from balancing the family checkbook to practicing karaoke bar singing
many of the companies are even dropping their traditional independence and trying to band together to create some sort of standard
two years ago most of the smaller makers joined under the <unk> <unk> umbrella to adopt a version of the american <unk> <unk> standard
that has n't generated much sales but this summer <unk> rallied all the major <unk> competitors to make their new machines compatible with the <unk> <unk> standard
a healthy coherent japanese market could also make it far easier for japanese companies to sell overseas where their share is still minimal
but it could also help american companies which also are starting to try to open the market
as with many other goods the american share of <unk> pc market is far below that in the rest of the world
<unk> makers have under n share compared with half the market in <unk> and <unk> at home
though no formal trade barriers exist the japanese computer industry is difficult n for outsiders to enter
if it were an open market we would have been in in <unk> or <unk> says <unk> <unk> who heads <unk> <unk> <unk> european and international operations
his company without any major effort sells more machines in <unk> than in <unk>
although it has opened a <unk> <unk> subsidiary it is still only studying <unk> the only nation that has n't adopted <unk> - oriented specifications
and because general retail centers such as <unk> have little presence in <unk> sales remain in the iron grip of established computer makers
but the americans are also to blame
they long made little effort here
<unk> though long a leader in the japanese mainframe business did n't introduce its first pc in <unk> until five years after <unk> did and that was n't compatible even with the <unk> <unk> standard
<unk> did n't introduce a kanji machine one that handles the chinese characters of written <unk> until three years after entering the market
critics also say n american companies charge too much
<unk> <unk> says n it is investigating <unk> for allegedly discouraging retailers from discounting
but the <unk> companies are redoubling their efforts
<unk> recently hired its first japanese president luring away an official of <unk> european operations as well as a whole japanese top - management team
earlier this year it introduced a much more powerful kanji operating system and a kanji laser printer
<unk> just last year started selling its first machine that could run in both <unk> and <unk> and that substantially enhances compatibility with its american products
it may take five years to break even in <unk> says <unk> <unk> <unk> who runs the <unk> - <unk> office for <unk> <unk> a <unk> software company
but it an enormous business opportunity
from a reading of the somewhat scant english - language medical literature on <unk> the french abortion pill emerges as one of the creepiest concoctions around
this is not only because it kills the unborn a job at which it actually is not outstandingly efficient zapping only <unk> to n of them depending on which study you read prostaglandin taken in conjunction with the pill boosts the rate to n
by contrast surgical abortion is <unk> effective
abortion via the pill is far more of an ordeal than conventional surgical abortion
it is time - consuming the abortion part alone lasts three days and the clinical part comprises a week worth of visits bloody one woman in a swedish trial required a transfusion although for most it resembles a menstrual period with bleeding lasting an average of <unk> days and painful many women require analgesic shots to ease them through
<unk> and vomiting are other common side effects
timing is of the essence with <unk>
it is most effective taken about a week after a woman misses her menstrual period up through the seventh week of pregnancy when it is markedly less effective
that is typically about a three - week window
so far all the studies have concluded that <unk> is safe
but safe in the definition of <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> means n there been no evidence so far of mortality
no one has researched the long - term effects of n on a woman health or fertility
the drug seems to suppress ovulation for three to seven months after it is taken
some women clearly have no trouble eventually conceiving again the studies have reported repeaters in their programs
but there are no scientific data on this question
rather ominously rabbit studies reveal that <unk> can cause birth defects lancet the british medical journal reported <unk> in <unk>
however <unk> <unk> - <unk> <unk> the french physician who invented <unk> wrote in a <unk> magazine article last month that the rabbit - test results could not be duplicated in rats and monkeys
the drug has a three - dimensional structure similar to that of <unk> the anti - miscarriage drug that has been linked to cervical and vaginal cancer in some of the daughters of the women who took it
all the published studies recommend that women on whom the drug proves ineffective not carry the pregnancy to term but undergo a surgical abortion
a risk of birth defects a sure source of lawsuits is one reason n the <unk> pharmaceutical industry is steering clear of <unk>
one might well ask why bother with this drug at all
some abortion advocates have been asking themselves this very question
n probably represents a technical advance in an area where none is needed or at least not very much said <unk> <unk> <unk> president of the <unk> <unk> <unk> at a reproductive health conference in <unk>
many physicians have expressed concern over the heavy bleeding which occurs even if the drug fails to induce an abortion
it typically takes from eight to n years to obtain the <unk> and <unk> <unk> approval for a new drug and the cost of testing and marketing a new drug can range from n million to n million
the <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> currently forbids the <unk> institutes of <unk> from funding abortion research as part of its n million contraceptive program
but the <unk> <unk> a <unk> n million nonprofit organization that has the backing of the <unk> and <unk> foundations and currently subsidizes most <unk> research on contraceptives has recently been paying for <unk> studies of n on a license from its french developer <unk> - <unk> a joint subsidiary of the german pharmaceutical company <unk> and the french government
in the year since the pill went on the french market the <unk> <unk> for women and its offshoot former <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for a <unk> <unk> have been trying to browbeat the <unk> pharmaceutical industry into getting involved
its scare - tactic prediction the pill will be available in the <unk> either legally or illegally in no more than n years
following the feminist and population - control lead has been a generally bovine press
a <unk> n article in <unk> <unk> magazine is typical of the general level of media ignorance
for a woman whose period is late using n means no waiting no walking past picket lines at abortion clinics and no feet up in stirrups for surgery burbles health writer <unk> <unk>
it also means n she will never have to know whether she had actually been pregnant
wrong on all counts <unk> <unk>
n is being administered in <unk> only under strict supervision in the presence of a doctor
<unk> reportedly has every pill marked and accounted for to make sure n none slips into the black market
thus a woman who used n to have an abortion would have to make three trips to the clinic past those picket lines an initial visit for medical screening anemics and those with previous pregnancy problems are eliminated and to take the pill a second trip n hours later for the prostaglandin administered either via injection or vaginal suppository and a third trip a week later to make sure n she has completely aborted
furthermore because timing is so critical with <unk> she will learn via a pelvic examination and ultrasound not only that she is pregnant but just how pregnant she is
no doctor who fears malpractice liability would likely expose a non - pregnant patient to the risk of hemorrhaging
many women may even see the dead embryo n they have expelled a sight n the surgical - abortion industry typically spares them
at seven weeks an embryo is about three - fourths of an inch long and recognizably human
at the behest of pro - choice members of <unk> a four - year reauthorization bill for <unk> <unk> federal family - planning assistance now contains a n million grant for development evaluation and bringing to the marketplace of new improved contraceptive devices drugs and methods
if this passes a <unk> version has already been cleared for a floor vote that is likely early next year it would put the federal government into the contraceptive marketing business for the first time
it also could put the government into the n business which would please feminists dismayed at what they view as pusillanimity in the private - sector drug industry
we do not know whether <unk> will be as disastrous as some of the earlier fertility - control methods released to unblinking uncritical cheers from educated people who should have known better
remember the <unk> <unk> and the early birth - control pills
we will not know until a first generation of female guinea pigs all of whom will be more than happy to volunteer for the job has put the abortion pill through the clinical test of time

this article is adapted from one in the <unk> <unk> <unk>
on <unk> <unk> a major part of our trade deficit went poof
no figure juggling no witchcraft just vastly improved recording of some of our exports
the result
the <unk> <unk> found that <unk> exports in <unk> net of imports were understated by n billion a year and understated at the annualized rate of n billion in the first quarter of <unk>
more than half of the newly found net exports were from just a few service - sector categories
some of the biggest service - industry exporters american financial - service companies for example have yet to be fully included in our export statistics
nearly n years ago representatives of service - sector companies worked out a plan with the <unk> <unk> to improve the data on service - sector exports
both groups believed that tens of billions of dollars of service exports such as inbound tourism legal accounting and other professional services furnished to foreigners financial engineering and construction services and the like were not being counted as exports
the monthly trade deficit figure is limited to traditional merchandise trade manufactured goods and raw materials
in the quarterly balance - of-payments report those merchandise trade figures are merged with statistics on exports and imports of services as well as returns on investments abroad by americans and returns on foreign investments in the <unk>
over time through benchmark surveys the corrected data on service exports and imports have been gathered
the first three major areas of the service sector n to be revamped were expenditures by foreign students in the <unk> net after expenditures by americans studying abroad some exports by professional firms a law firm billing a german client for services rendered in watching legislation in <unk> is as much an export as shipment of an american jet engine and improved data from travel and tourism
in just these three areas the <unk> <unk> found <unk> billion more exports than previously reported and n billion more imports with the net result that the <unk> service surplus in <unk> increased by n billion to <unk> billion
combined with recalculations and revisions in other trade areas the value of <unk> net exports that had not previously been recorded was about n billion a year
that means that the <unk> trade deficit was running closer to n billion than to <unk> billion in <unk> and <unk> billion annualized rather than n billion in the first quarter of <unk>
these revised figures also may explain some of the recent strength of the dollar
the materially smaller trade deficit may have been already discounted in the market
what does this mean for trade policy
too early to tell but a trade deficit that is significantly smaller than we imagined does suggest a review of our trade posture
it does not relieve the need for our market - opening efforts for both goods and services but it does suggest that it is our exports of services and not just borrowing that is financing our imports of goods

the collapse of a n billion labor - management buy - out of <unk> <unk> parent <unk> <unk> may not stop some of <unk> <unk> top talent from collecting up to n million in fees
according to one person familiar with the airline the buy - out group led by <unk> pilots union and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has begun billing <unk> for fees and expenses n it owes to investment bankers law firms and banks
the tab even covers n million in commitment fees owed to <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> even though their failure to obtain n billion in bank loans for the buy - out was the main reason for its collapse
under a merger agreement reached <unk> n the <unk> board agreed to reimburse certain of the buy - out group expenses out of company funds even if the transaction was n't completed provided <unk> the group did n't breach the agreement
the failure to obtain financing does n't by itself constitute a breach
the merger agreement says n the buy - out group is entitled to be repaid n million in fees for its investment bankers <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> brothers <unk> and its law firm <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the buy - out group is also entitled to n million n to repay a fund created by the pilots union for an employee stock ownership plan
in addition to the n million for <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> is also owed n million for promising to make a n million bridge loan
a spokesman for the buy - out group was n't immediately available for comment
separately <unk> stock rose n a share to n in composite trading on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on reports that <unk> <unk> investor <unk> <unk> has asked <unk> <unk> unions if they interested in cooperating with <unk> <unk> in a new bid for <unk>
but neither the pilots nor the machinists appear interested and <unk> <unk> is barred from making a new bid under terms of an agreement n he made with <unk> in <unk> unless <unk> accepts an offer below <unk> a share
<unk> <unk> continued to buckle under the public outcry against computer - driven program trading
<unk> <unk> <unk> a unit of <unk> <unk> <unk> announced <unk> it would stop doing stock - index arbitrage for its own account and <unk> <unk> <unk> pulled out of the practice altogether
at the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which has been buffeted by complaints from angry individual investors and the exchange own listed companies <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> held an emergency meeting with senior partners of some of the <unk> <unk> n stock specialist firms
the specialists a trader said n were livid about <unk> <unk> recent remarks that sophisticated computer - driven trading strategies are here to stay
many investors blame program trading for wild swings in the stock market including the <unk> plunge in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> n
a specialist is an exchange member designated to maintain a fair and orderly market in a specified stock
<unk> <unk> meeting with the floor brokers comes as he prepares to explain the exchange position on program trading to key congressional regulators in a closed session tomorrow according to exchange officials
a <unk> <unk> spokesman would only say we working the problem and looking at the issue and meeting with a broad number of customers and constituents to get their views and ideas on the issue
the program - trading outcry was taken to a new level when giant <unk> <unk> said n it and <unk> or more of the <unk> <unk> listed companies are forming an unprecedented alliance to complain about the exchange role in program trading
the decision by <unk> the nation largest securities firm represents the biggest retreat yet from program trading
<unk> has been the fourth - biggest stock - index arbitrage trader on the <unk> <unk> this year executing an average of n million shares a month in such trades or about one million shares a day
<unk> move is one of the most sweeping program - trading pullbacks of recent days because the big securities firm will no longer execute stock - index arbitrage trades for customers
most <unk> <unk> firms in pulling back have merely stopped such trading for their own accounts
<unk> has been one of the main firms executing index arbitrage for customers
<unk> also said n it is lobbying for significant regulatory controls on program trading including tough margin or down - payment requirements and limits on price moves for program - driven financial futures
<unk> in a statement by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> index arbitrage has been clearly identified in the investing public mind as a contributing factor to excess market volatility so <unk> wo n't execute such trades until effective controls are in place
in stock - index arbitrage traders buy and sell large amounts of stocks with offsetting trades in stock - index futures and options
the idea is to lock in profits from short - term swings in volatile markets
last <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> also said n it would cease index arbitrage altogether but the firm was n't as big an index arbitrager as <unk> is
other large firms including <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> last week announced a pullback from index arbitrage but only for the firms own accounts
<unk> made an abrupt about - face on program trading yesterday after a special meeting between the firm president and chief executive officer <unk> <unk> and its senior managers
just a week ago <unk> <unk> staunchly defended index arbitrage at <unk> the most active index - arbitrage trading firm on the stock exchange this year
index arbitrage <unk> <unk> said n last week does n't have a negative impact on the market as a whole and <unk> customers were sophisticated enough to know that
but yesterday <unk> <unk> said <unk> big institutional investors which he would n't identify told us n they would n't do business with firms that continued to do index arbitrage for their own accounts
we were following the trend of our competitors who were under pressure from institutions he said
<unk> so far this year has executed a monthly average of n million shares in index - arbitrage trading and is second only to <unk> <unk> in overall program trading which includes index arbitrage
most of <unk> program trading is for its own account according to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> denied that <unk> chairman and chief executive <unk> <unk> <unk> had anything <unk> to do with <unk> decision
but at least one chief executive said n he called <unk> <unk> to complain about <unk> aggressive use of program trading and other market sources said <unk> they understood that <unk> <unk> received many phone calls complaining about <unk> reliance on index arbitrage as a major business
<unk> has generally been sensitive to suggestions that <unk> makes decisions for its <unk> unit
our decision had nothing n to do with any pressure n <unk> <unk> received <unk> <unk> said
this was a <unk> <unk> stand - alone decision
a spokeswoman for <unk> in <unk> <unk> said absolutely no one spoke to <unk> <unk> on this subject and added anyone who claims <unk> they talked to <unk> <unk> is n't telling the truth
supporters of index arbitrage have n't been publicly sticking up for the trading strategy as some did during the post - crash outcry of <unk>
but <unk> <unk> in its statement about pulling out of index arbitrage suggested that the current debate has missed the mark
<unk> said <unk> it continues to believe that the causes of excess market volatility are far more complex than any particular computer trading strategy
indeed there are legitimate hedging strategies used by managers of large portfolios such as pension funds that involve program trading as a means of protecting the assets of their pension beneficiaries
<unk> index arbitragers will continue to do other kinds of computer - assisted program trading so there probably wo n't be any layoffs at the firm people familiar with <unk> program operation said n
meanwhile <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> his firm will continue stock - index arbitrage for its clients
at the firm annual meeting last night he told shareholders that index arbitrage wo n't go away despite the public outcry
if they think n they are going to stop index arbitrage by causing a few <unk> <unk> firms to quit they are crazy <unk> <unk> said
it not going to stop it at all
<unk> <unk> noting that stock - index arbitrage rises and ebbs with stock market volatility said that for the first four months of the firm fiscal year beginning in <unk> stock - index arbitrage had been a break - even proposition for <unk> <unk>
in response to a shareholder suggestion <unk> <unk> agreed that european firms will simply pick up the index - arbitrage business left behind by <unk> institutions
pressure from big institutional investors has been the major catalyst for <unk> <unk> program - trading pullback
and there was speculation yesterday that <unk> investments and other large mutual - fund companies might soon follow the lead of <unk> <unk> and other institutions in cutting off trading business to securities firms that do program trading
a <unk> spokesman in <unk> denied the speculation saying n the program - trading issue was more of a regulatory problem
but a much smaller mutual fund company the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> unit of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said n it informed nine national brokerage firms n it will cease business with them unless they stop index - arbitrage trading
<unk> with <unk> mutual fund accounts manages more than <unk> billion n billion of which is in the stock market

the <unk> <unk> agreed to decide whether the federal <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> may require <unk> <unk> to reassume funding responsibility for a n billion shortfall in the company pension plans
the high court decision expected next spring may affect the stability of many large corporate pension plans that have relied on the availability of pension insurance provided by the federal pension regulatory and insurance agency
the agency which is funded through insurance premiums from employers insures pension benefits for some n million private - sector workers who take part in single - employer pension plans
it recently reported assets of n billion and liabilities of n billion
in its appeal to the high court the agency said the federal appeals court ruling which favored <unk> threatened to transform the agency from an insurer of troubled pension plans into an open - ended source of industry bailouts
the ruling also may determine how quickly <unk> is able to complete its chapter n reorganization
<unk> filed for protection under chapter n in federal bankruptcy court in <unk>
the filing was partly the result of the <unk> billion shortfall in <unk> three pension plans operated for its <unk> <unk> <unk> subsidiary employees
in <unk> n as <unk> <unk> continued operating while under reorganization the agency terminated the three <unk> pension plans to keep its insurance liability from increasing
termination means that the agency insurance assumes the liabilities and pays the pension benefits already owed under the plans but workers do n't accrue new benefits
a few months later under pressure from the <unk> steelworkers of <unk> <unk> instituted a new program <unk> to provide retirement benefits similar to those in the terminated plans
because the federal pension agency had taken over the old plans <unk> would be responsible only for benefits paid under the new pension plans
but the agency viewed the creation of the new plans as an abuse of federal pension law and an attempt to transfer the liability of the <unk> billion shortfall from <unk> to federal insurance
the agency also concluded that <unk> financial status had improved while it was under reorganization
in <unk> n it ordered <unk> to reassume liability and funding for the three original plans
<unk> challenged the order and a federal district court in <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> ruled that the agency improperly ordered <unk> to reassume responsibility for the plans
in <unk> a federal appeals court in <unk> <unk> agreed that the agency acted unlawfully
the appeals court said n there was no evidence that <unk> intended to allow the pension agency to consider a company creation of new benefit plans as a basis for ordering that company to reassume liability for old plans
the appeals court also said <unk> the agency had to consider a company long - term ability to fund pension plans not just short - term improved financial status
in <unk> <unk> said that it was disappointed that the court agreed to hear the case because it believes n the move will further delay its chapter n proceedings
the company has n't been able to come up with a reorganization plan in part because of the sizable disagreement with the pension agency
but <unk> a steel aerospace and energy concern said n it is confident that the <unk> <unk> will uphold the lower - court decisions and said n it expects to continue discussions with the agency about a settlement while the case is being reviewed

call it disaster marketing
<unk> <unk> is just one of a slew of advertisers that have hitched their ads to the devastating <unk> <unk> quake and <unk> <unk>
sometimes the ads attempt to raise money always they try to boost good will
by advertising disaster relief these companies are hoping to don a white hat and come out a hero
but the strategy can backfire if the ads appear too self - serving the companies may end up looking like rank opportunists instead of good samaritans
that has n't deterred plenty of companies
along with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> have tied ads to <unk> <unk> donations
other ads do n't bother with the fundraising a touching if self - congratulatory <unk> <unk> <unk> ad that aired <unk> intermixed footage of the devastation in <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> with interviews of people recounting how <unk> helped
at <unk> we felt n we wanted to do something to help them gather money and we had this airtime on <unk> <unk> <unk> explains <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> advertising creative manager
what did we get out of it
we got some exposure and pretty much good will
the ads are just the latest evidence of how television advertising is getting faster on the draw
while tv commercials typically take weeks to produce advertisers in the past couple of years have learned to turn on a dime to crash out ads in days or even hours
the big brokerage houses learned the art of the instant commercial after the <unk> crash when they turned out reassuring ads inviting investors right back into the stock market
they trotted out another crop of instant commercials after the sudden market dip a few weeks ago
<unk> created its quake ad in a weekend
but as advertisers latch onto disasters with increasing frequency they risk hurting themselves as much as helping the cause
they chance alienating the customers n they hope to woo by looking like opportunistic sharks
people see extra messages in advertising and if a manufacturer is clearly trying to get something out of it if it too transparent then consumers will see through that warns <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman of the advertising department at the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> at <unk> <unk>

the <unk> <unk> let stand a <unk> <unk> court ruling that the manufacturers of a drug once used to prevent miscarriages must share liability for injuries or deaths when the maker of an individual dose is unknown
the high court action refusing to hear appeals by several drug companies is likely to have a significant impact at several levels
the most immediate effect is in <unk> <unk> where former manufacturers of the anti - miscarriage drug <unk> the synthetic female hormone diethylstilbestrol face the prospect of shared liability for damages in many of the <unk> to <unk> <unk> lawsuits pending in that state
the lawsuits stemmed from the development of cancer and other problems in the daughters of women who took the drug
on a broader scale the ruling could encourage other states courts to adopt the logic of the <unk> <unk> court not only in <unk> cases but in other product - related lawsuits as well
the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> ruling parallels a n decision by the <unk> <unk> <unk> requiring shared liability among manufacturers for injuries when it ca n't be determined which company is at fault
<unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> lawyer who represents <unk> victims said that before the <unk> <unk> ruling only the states of <unk> and <unk> had followed the <unk> decision
now that the <unk> <unk> decision has been left intact other states may follow suit
generally when <unk> <unk> and <unk> go one way it has a tremendous influence on other states especially small ones said <unk> <unk>
the high court refused to hear appeals by <unk> <unk> <unk> which went out of business in <unk> and was taken over by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a unit of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
the appeals involved <unk> which was approved by the <unk> and <unk> <unk> for use from the <unk> until n to prevent miscarriages during pregnancy
in <unk> the <unk> banned the use of <unk> after studies linked it to cancer and other problems in daughters of women who took the drug
lawsuits over the harm caused by <unk> have flooded federal and state courts in the past decade
in many cases the lawsuit was filed long after the drug was used the cancer in the daughters was typically not detected for years and there is no way n to prove which of several companies manufactured the doses consumed by certain women
under traditional legal theories inability to prove which company manufactured a drug that caused an injury or death would lead to the lawsuit being dismissed
but in its ruling last <unk> the <unk> <unk> court said that all producers of the anti - miscarriage drug should share liability when the manufacturer of a specific dose ca n't be determined
each company share of liability would be based on their share of the national <unk> market
the <unk> <unk> court also upheld a state law passed in n extending for one year the statute of limitations on filing <unk> lawsuits
the effect is that lawsuits that might have been barred because they were filed too late could proceed because of the one - year extension

the high court leaving intact a n million damage award against <unk> <unk> <unk> declined to resolve questions about a legal defense against civil lawsuits often used by government contractors
last year the <unk> <unk> defined when companies such as military contractors may defend themselves against lawsuits for deaths or injuries by asserting that they were simply following specifications of a federal government contract
in that decision the high court said <unk> a company must prove that the government approved precise specifications for the contract that those specifications were met and that the government was warned of any dangers in use of the equipment
but last <unk> a federal appeals court in <unk> <unk> upheld a damage award against <unk> dynamics rejecting the company use of the government contractor defense
the appeals court said <unk> the defense is valid only if federal officials did more than rubber stamp a company design or plans and engaged in a substantive review and evaluation on a par with a policy decision
<unk> <unk> appealed to the high court backed by numerous business trade groups arguing that the appeals court definition restricts the defense too severely
<unk> <unk> was sued by the families of five <unk> divers who were killed in <unk> after they re - entered a submarine through a diving chamber

it can be hoped that spanish <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> will draw the right conclusion from his narrow election victory <unk>
a strong challenge from the far left the communist coalition <unk> <unk> failed to topple him
he should consider his victory a mandate to continue his growth - oriented economic reforms and not a demand that he move further left
if he follows the correct path he may be able to look back on this election as the high - water mark of far - left opposition
the far left had some good issues even if it did not have good programs for dealing with them
it could point to plenty of ailments that the spanish economic rejuvenation so far has failed to cure
unemployment still is officially recorded at <unk> the highest rate in <unk> although actual joblessness may be lower
housing is scarce and public services the court system schools mail service telephone network and the highways are in disgraceful condition
large pockets of poverty still exist
the left also is critical of the style of the socialist government a remarkable parallel to the situation in <unk>
<unk> <unk> and his colleagues particularly the finance minister <unk> <unk> are charged with having abandoned their socialist principles and with having become arrogant elitists who refuse even to go on television controlled by the state to face their accusers
in response to this the socialist prime minister has simply cited his free - market accomplishments
they are very considerable since <unk> when <unk> joined the <unk> <unk> its gross domestic product has grown at an annual average of <unk> the fastest in the <unk>
in that time more than n million jobs have been created and the official jobless rate has been pushed below <unk> from <unk>
a n inflation rate dropped below <unk>
net foreign investment through <unk> this year has been running at a pace of <unk> billion about double the year - earlier rate
<unk> <unk> also has split with the left in reaffirming <unk> <unk> commitment and in renewing a defense treaty with the <unk>
<unk> <unk> is not quite a closet supply - side revolutionary however
he did not go as far as he could have in tax reductions indeed he combined them with increases in indirect taxes
yet the best n the far - left could do was not enough to deter the biggest voting bloc nearly n from endorsing the direction n <unk> is taking
now he can go further
he should do more to reduce tax rates on wealth and income in recognition of the fact that those cuts yield higher not lower revenues
he could do more to cut public subsidies and transfers thus making funds available for public services starved of money for six years
the voters delivered <unk> <unk> a third mandate for his successes
they as well as numerous latin american and east european countries that hope to adopt elements of the spanish model are supporting the direction n <unk> is taking
it would be sad for <unk> <unk> to abandon them to appease his foes

just when american liberalism had pulled the arms plug on the contras and their friend <unk> <unk> along comes <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> this weekend to blunder into the hands of what are often called conservatives
conservatives are the faction in <unk> politics which always said that <unk> <unk> and his friends do n't want to hold an election in <unk>
liberals are the faction that says give peace a chance now they are saying <unk> <unk> <unk> should give them a break lest the conservatives ask them to vote for bullets instead of bandages
we suspect <unk> <unk> <unk> knows the difference between a blunder and a strategy
he knows that making <unk> <unk> look silly in a photograph with him will trigger noriegan fulminations and that announcing an end to the liberals cease - fire will produce mainly their concern over the contras military activities in northern <unk>
<unk> <unk> understands better than those who worry about his behavior that what sustains the <unk> movement is not democratic peace but nondemocratic unpeace
it is the presence of internal and external enemies which justifies the need for a large active army that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> continues to supply with bullets

four other countries in <unk> have approved <unk> in recent months
<unk> is currently trying to obtain federal regulatory clearance for <unk> distribution
the <unk> <unk> proposed that banks be required to keep detailed records of international wire transfers which officials believe <unk> is the main vehicle used by drug traffickers to move billions of dollars in and out of the <unk>
in recent testimony on <unk> <unk> <unk> officials said n they were considering the new reporting requirements and the expected publication of the proposal in the <unk> <unk> today is the first official step toward creating final regulations
the <unk> is still working out the details with bank trade associations and the other government agencies that have a hand in fighting money laundering
among the possibilities <unk> the <unk> is considering are requirements that banks keep records identifying the originators and recipients of international wire transfers
another suggestion would draw banks more directly into tracking down money launderers by developing a suspicious international wire transfer profile which banks would use to spotlight questionable payments
but banks may prefer using a profile that targets selected transactions rather than a blanket reporting requirement
banks now are required only to report cash deposits or withdrawals of <unk> or more
but wire transfers from a standing account including those bigger than <unk> are n't reported
officials believe <unk> this has left a gaping loophole that illegal drug businesses are exploiting
authorities estimate that revenues from illegal drugs in the <unk> total about n billion annually
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman of a <unk> <unk> relations subcommittee that oversees the issue of money laundering criticized the proposal for ignoring wire transfers between foreign banks that are executed and cleared on <unk> wire systems

<unk> <unk> <unk> took steps to withdraw its proposed debt swap for n million in high - interest notes and said n it is looking at other alternatives for refinancing the debt
<unk> <unk> had said two weeks ago that it might withdraw the pending offer which would have replaced n million in so - called reset notes now paying n annual interest and set to come due in <unk> with two new issues paying lower interest
yesterday the company said <unk> it had filed a request with the securities and <unk> <unk> to withdraw the registration statement regarding the proposed swap
a <unk> <unk> spokesman citing adverse developments in the market for high - yield junk bonds declined to say what alternatives are under consideration
but some holders of the <unk> <unk> notes expect the company to propose a more - attractive debt swap that will give them a substantial equity stake in the company
<unk> <unk> has had major losses in recent years as its telex business has faltered in the face of competition from facsimile machines and as other business ventures have gone awry
the major question said n one holder who asked not to be named is whether <unk> <unk> investor <unk> <unk> <unk> whose <unk> partners controls <unk> <unk> is willing to offer a large enough equity stake to entice bondholders into agreeing to a new swap
the n million in notes the largest chunk of <unk> <unk> n million in long - term debt stems from the company major restructuring in <unk> n
the notes became burdensome when reset provisions allowed their interest rate to be raised to <unk> last <unk>
<unk> <unk> had offered to swap each <unk> face amount of the notes for six shares of common stock and two new debt issues a <unk> note paying an interest rate starting at <unk> annually and rising in later years due in <unk> and a <unk> note due in <unk> paying a fixed rate of n and including rights protecting a holder against a decline in the trading price of the bond
<unk> <unk> must make n million in interest payments on the reset notes on <unk> n and a company spokesman said n it fully intends to meet the payments
but <unk> <unk> has said n it must lower the interest rate on its debt to regain full financial health

medical scientists are starting to uncover a handful of genes which if damaged unleash the chaotic growth of cells that characterizes cancer
scientists say n the discovery of these genes in recent months is painting a new and startling picture of how cancer develops
an emerging understanding of the genes is expected to produce an array of new strategies for future cancer treatment and prevention
that is for the future
already scientists are developing tests based on the newly identified genes that for the first time can predict whether an otherwise healthy individual is likely to get cancer
it a super - exciting set of discoveries says <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> researcher who has just found a gene pivotal to the triggering of colon cancer
only a decade ago cancer was a black box about which we knew nothing at the molecular level
today we know that the accumulation of several of these altered genes can initiate a cancer and then propel it into a deadly state
scientists call the new class of genes tumor - suppressors or simply anti - cancer genes
when functioning normally they make proteins that hold a cell growth in check
but if the genes are damaged perhaps by radiation a chemical or through a chance accident in cell division their growth - suppressing proteins no longer work and cells normally under control turn malignant
the newly identified genes differ from a family of genes discovered in the early n called oncogenes
oncogenes must be present for a cell to become malignant but researchers have found them in normal as well as in cancerous cells suggesting that oncogenes do n't cause cancer by themselves
in recent months researchers have come to believe n the two types of cancer genes work in concert an oncogene may turn proliferating cells malignant only after the tumor - suppressor gene has been damaged
like all genes tumor - suppressor genes are inherited in two copies one from each parent
either copy can make the proteins needed to control cell growth so for cancer to arise both copies must be impaired
a person who is born with one defective copy of a suppressor gene or in whom one copy is damaged early in life is especially prone to cancer because he need only lose the other copy for a cancer to develop
emerging genetic tests will be able to spot such cancer - susceptible individuals ushering in what some scientists believe <unk> is a new age of predictive cancer diagnosis
<unk> and <unk> <unk> are among the first beneficiaries of the new findings
the <unk> <unk> couple knew even before <unk> became pregnant in <unk> that any child of theirs had a <unk> chance of being at risk for retinoblastoma an eye cancer that occurs about once every n births
<unk> <unk> <unk> years old knew n he carried a damaged gene having lost an eye to the rare tumor when he was only two months old after his mother had suffered the same fate when she was a baby
because of the isolation of the retinoblastoma tumor - suppressor gene it became possible last <unk> to find out what threat the <unk> baby faced
a test using new genetic probes showed that little <unk> <unk> had not inherited a damaged retinoblastoma supressor gene and therefore faced no more risk than other children of developing the rare cancer
it made our <unk> <unk> says <unk> <unk>
this test was the first n to predict reliably whether an individual could expect to develop cancer
equally important the initial discovery of the gene that controls retinal cell growth made by a <unk> doctor named <unk> <unk> has opened a field of cancer study which in recent months has exploded
it turns out that studying a tragic but uncommon tumor made possible some fundamental insights about the most basic workings of cancer says <unk> <unk> director of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
all this may not be obvious to the public which is concerned about advances in treatment but i am convinced n this basic research will begin showing results there soon
to date scientists have fingered two of these cancer - suppressors
<unk> <unk> made his retinoblastoma discovery in <unk>
then last spring researchers reported finding a gene called n which if impaired turns healthy colon cells cancerous
soon after that report two other research teams uncovered evidence that the same damaged <unk> gene is present in tissue from lung and breast cancers
colon lung and breast cancers are the most common and lethal forms of the disease collectively killing almost <unk> <unk> a year
right now about a dozen laboratories in the <unk> <unk> and <unk> are racing to unmask other suspected tumor - suppressing genes
they have about seven candidates
researchers say n the inactivation of tumor - suppressor genes alone or in combination appears crucial to the development of such scourges as cancer of the brain the skin kidney prostate and cervix
there is evidence that if people inherit defective versions of these genes they are especially prone to cancer perhaps explaining finally why some cancers seem to haunt certain families
the story of tumor - suppressor genes goes back to the n when a pediatrician named <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> proposed that retinoblastoma stemmed from two separate genetic defects
he theorized that in the eye cancer an infant inherited a damaged copy of a gene from one parent and a normal copy from the other
the tumor he suggested <unk> developed when the second normal copy also was damaged
but there was no way n to prove <unk> <unk> two - hit theory
back then scientists had no way of ferreting out specific genes but under a microscope they could see the <unk> pairs of chromosomes in the cells that contain the genes
occasionally gross chromosome damage was visible
<unk> <unk> found that some children with the eye cancer had inherited a damaged copy of chromosome no . n from a parent who had had the disease
under a microscope he could actually see that a bit of chromosome n was missing
he assumed n the missing piece contained a gene or genes whose loss had a critical role in setting off the cancer
but he did n't know which gene or genes had disappeared
then a scientific team led by molecular geneticist <unk> <unk> then at the <unk> of <unk> found the answer
the team used a battery of the newly developed gene probes snippets of genetic material that can track a gene presence in a cell
by analyzing cells extracted from eye tumors they found defects in the second copy of chromosome n in the exact area as in the first copy of the chromosome
the finding riveted medicine
it was the first time <unk> anyone had showed that the loss of both copies of the same gene could lead to the eruption of a cancer
it was extraordinarily satisfying says <unk> <unk> now at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>
i was convinced that what was true of retinoblastoma would be true for all cancers
it was an audacious claim
but in <unk> <unk> <unk> a young molecular biologist at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> believed <unk> <unk> <unk> was right and set out to repeat the <unk> experiment in cells from other cancers
his was one of two research teams in <unk> <unk> to report dual chromosome losses for a rare childhood cancer of the kidney called <unk> tumor
<unk> <unk> next turned his attention to colon cancer the second biggest cancer killer in the <unk> after lung cancer
he believed n colon cancer might also arise from multiple hits on cancer suppressor genes because it often seems to develop in stages
it often is preceded by the development of polyps in the bowel which in some cases become increasingly malignant in identifiable stages progressing from less severe to deadly as though a cascade of genetic damage might be occurring
<unk> <unk> and a doctoral student <unk> <unk> began months of tedious and often frustrating probing of the chromosomes searching for signs of genetic damage
they began uncovering a confusing variety of genetic deletions some existing only in benign polyps others in malignant cells and many in both polyps and malignant cells
gradually a coherent picture of cancer development emerged
if both copies of a certain gene were knocked out benign polyps would develop
if both copies of a second gene were then deleted the polyps would progress to malignancy
it was clear that more than one gene had to be damaged for colon cancer to develop
their report galvanized other molecular biologists
it was the confirming evidence n we all needed that gene losses were critical to the development of a common tumor says <unk> <unk> at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>
but <unk> <unk> had yet to nail the identity of the gene that if damaged flipped a colon cell into full - blown malignancy
they focused on chromosome n
for months the <unk> <unk> researchers using gene probes experimentally crawled down the length of chromosome n looking for the smallest common bit of genetic material lost in all tumor cells
such a piece of <unk> would probably constitute a gene
when they found it last winter <unk> <unk> was dubious that the search was over
his doubts stemmed from the fact that several years earlier a <unk> <unk> researcher <unk> <unk> had found in experiments with mice that a gene called n could transform normal cells into cancerous ones
the deletion <unk> <unk> <unk> found was in exactly the same spot as n
but <unk> <unk> had said <unk> the <unk> gene caused cancer by promoting growth whereas the <unk> <unk> scientists were looking for a gene that suppressed growth
despite that when the <unk> <unk> scientists compared the gene <unk> they had found in the human cancer cells with the <unk> <unk> <unk> gene they found n the two were identical it turned out that in <unk> <unk> cancer studies he had unknowingly been observing a damaged form of <unk> a cancer - suppressing gene
the discovery suddenly puts an obscure gene right in the cockpit of cancer formation says <unk> <unk> <unk> a leader in cancer - gene research at <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
evidence now is emerging that the <unk> suppressor gene is involved in other cancers too
researchers in <unk> <unk> have found that in <unk> of n breast tumors one copy of chromosome n was mutated at the spot where gene n lies
the scientists say that since breast cancer often strikes multiple members of certain families the gene when inherited in a damaged form may predispose women to the cancer
the <unk> gene has just been implicated in lung cancer
in a report out last week <unk> <unk> and colleagues at the <unk> <unk> <unk> say that about half the cells taken from lung cancer tissue n they tested are missing this gene
there also are reports from several labs as yet unpublished of missing <unk> genes in tissue taken from kidney brain and skin cancers
at the same time the <unk> <unk> team and others are rushing to pinpoint other tumor - suppressor genes
<unk> <unk> hopes soon to isolate one on chromosome n also involved in colon cancer
<unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> a researcher in <unk> <unk> are close to finding another gene involved with some types of colon cancer thought to be on chromosome n
<unk> <unk> believes <unk> people who inherit a defective gene somewhere on one of their two copies of chromosome n are especially prone to lung cancer
recently he and others reported that the retinoblastoma suppressor gene may also be involved in some lung cancers as well as several other more common cancers too
where these discoveries will lead scientists can only speculate
already two major pharmaceutical companies the <unk> unit of <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> are collaborating with gene hunters to turn the anticipated cascade of discoveries into predictive tests and maybe new therapies
some researchers say n new cancer drugs n to slow or reverse tumor growth may be based on the suppressor proteins normally produced by the genes
the idea would be to administer to patients the growth - controlling proteins made by healthy versions of the damaged genes
it may even be possible to replace defective genes with healthy versions though no one has come close to doing that so far
in any case says <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> we witnessing the discovery of one of the most important steps in the genesis of cancer
many investors give <unk> <unk> about as much chance of getting it together as <unk> <unk>
but now at least there a glimmer of hope for the stock
<unk> <unk> which breaks thousands of fresh eggs each morning is quietly switching over to an alternative egg product made by <unk> <unk>
known as <unk> <unk> the product has disappointed investors
when the company this month announced lower - than-forecast sales of <unk> <unk> the stock dropped nearly n
<unk> wo n't confirm the identities of any <unk> <unk> customers nor will it say much of anything else
two <unk> shareholder suits in the past month have accused top officers of making various untrue statements
these federal - court suits accuse the officers of failing to disclose that <unk> <unk> were unlikely to sell briskly enough to justify all of <unk> production capacity
but at least <unk> <unk> has signed on and says that by year end it wo n't be using any shell eggs
the <unk> fast - food chain owned by <unk> <unk> of <unk> expects to consume roughly n million pounds of liquefied eggs annually
so there is reason n to believe that <unk> hopes for a bacteria - free long - shelf-life egg were n't all hype
<unk> eggs are pasteurized in a heat - using process
still caution is advisable
a company official says <unk> <unk> break - even volume on <unk> <unk> is around n million pounds a year apparently well above current shipments and a far cry from what the company once suggested n was a billion - pound market waiting for such a product
perhaps to debunk the analysts talk of over - capacity <unk> today will take some of the skeptics on a tour of its new <unk> <unk> plant
there has been no announcement of the <unk> <unk> arrangement by either party possibly for fear that <unk> and other fast - food rivals would seize on it in scornful advertising
but <unk> <unk> operators independently confirm using <unk> product
other institutional users reportedly include <unk> which is moving away from fresh eggs on a region - by-region basis
the extent of <unk> use is n't known and <unk> officials could n't be reached for comment
<unk> <unk> has attracted a good many short - sellers the people who sell borrowed shares in a bet that a stock price will drop and allow the return of cheaper shares to the lender
many analysts question management credibility
the stock in my opinion is going to go lower not only because of disappointing earnings but because the credibility gap is certainly not closing says <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> says that at a recent <unk> - sponsored conference in <unk> <unk> he asked <unk> chief executive officer if the fourth quarter would be down
the ceo <unk> <unk> <unk> replied yes but would n't elaborate
the company did n't put out a public announcement
a spokesman said later that <unk> <unk> was being conservative in his estimate
but the spokesman added that while <unk> will earn less than last year <unk> a share it thinks <unk> <unk> estimates of <unk> or so are low
<unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> calls himself the last remaining bull on the stock
he argues that <unk> <unk> is misunderstood this is a growth company in the packaged food industry a rare breed like finding a white rhino
earnings are n't keeping pace he says n because of heavy investments in the egg technologies and drought - related costs in its potato business
<unk> <unk> however believes n the company egg product wo n't help the bottom line in the short run even though it makes sense it more convenient and justifies its price which is higher than shell eggs because of health and sanitation concerns
prospective competition is one problem
last week a closely held <unk> <unk> concern <unk> <unk> - <unk> <unk> products <unk> rolled out an aseptically packaged liquefied item called <unk> <unk>
company <unk> <unk> <unk> says <unk> <unk> will be among his clients as well
<unk> shares closed at <unk> <unk> yesterday in national over - the-counter trading
says <unk> <unk> - based short seller <unk> <unk> in my mind this is a n stock
<unk> late yesterday announced a n million stock buy - back program
<unk> which also processes potatoes still relies on spuds for about a fourth of its sales and nearly half its pretax profit
but dry growing conditions in the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> are pushing spot prices of potatoes beyond what <unk> contracted to pay last spring
company lawyers recently sent letters to growers saying that <unk> would take very seriously any effort to divert its contracted - for potatoes to other outlets
still analysts believe that profit margins in the potato business will be down again this year
<unk> <unk> a canadian newspaper publisher little - known in the <unk> figures to become a big player in <unk> american printing and his ambitions do n't end there
yesterday <unk> <unk> a <unk> printing publishing and forest - products company n by <unk> <unk> agreed to acquire <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> printing subsidiary <unk> <unk> <unk> for n million in cash and securities
the purchase expected to be completed by year end will make <unk> the second - largest commercial printer in <unk> <unk> behind only <unk> <unk> sons <unk> <unk>
the printing customers that <unk> will gain through <unk> <unk> include the <unk> newspaper supplement <unk> <unk> sports <unk> and tv <unk>
but the transaction is just <unk> <unk> latest step in a larger design to build <unk> through acquisitions into an integrated paper publishing and printing concern with a reach throughout <unk> <unk>
he already has achieved vertical integration on a limited scale <unk> can put a weekly newspaper on almost any <unk> doorstep without using outside help from chopping down the tree to making the newsprint to flinging it up onto the porch
analysts say <unk> <unk> purchase is part of a trend toward consolidation in the north american printing industry
along with <unk> says <unk> <unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> has positioned itself as one of the two key players
he adds i think n this is a great strategic move for <unk>
they are buying an operation that is running well
<unk> <unk> says n he is n't trying to catch up to <unk> which has annual sales of over <unk> billion
size does n't matter <unk> <unk> says
what counts is the bottom line
some of <unk> <unk> ventures including an earlier push into the <unk> market have n't paid off on the bottom line
<unk> started the <unk> <unk> a daily tabloid in <unk> and closed it three years later
the venture cost <unk> n million <unk> <unk> says <unk>
more recently some former <unk> executives started their own printing company specializing in printing and distributing advertising circulars
<unk> still lags in the <unk> circulars market while <unk> <unk> former employees are expanding across <unk>
<unk> <unk> took his first big gamble n years ago when he took advantage of a strike at <unk> <unk> then <unk> dominant french - language newspaper to launch the <unk> <unk> <unk>
the tabloid circulation soared to <unk> but plunged to under <unk> when the <unk> <unk> strike ended
still <unk> <unk> stuck with the venture
now the <unk> flush with ads and hugely profitable is even with <unk> <unk> in weekend circulation and outsells it n to n every weekday
<unk> <unk> has never made any apologies for publishing the tabloid a brash mix of crime and sports
i read <unk> he answers critics
it tabloid news from a to z
<unk> also publishes a second tabloid in <unk> the struggling <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> dailies in <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and dozens of weeklies covering most of <unk>
a series of recent acquisitions made it the dominant magazine publisher in <unk>
after a recent merger it is also the only province - wide distributor of magazines and newspapers in <unk>
finally with <unk> <unk> the company controls <unk> of <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> pulp and paper concern
in yesterday accord <unk> agreed to pay n million in cash for <unk> <unk> and to give <unk> <unk> a <unk> stake valued at n million in <unk> new printing subsidiary

<unk> <unk> a state judge since <unk> said n the mandatory - retirement age hurts the court system because it deprives the state of experienced judges still capable of serving on the bench
the issue is n't age age is just a number
the issue is one of a judge experience his competence and his physical ability to serve on the bench <unk> <unk> said
i had no problems performing my duties and responsibilities
because <unk> <unk> turned <unk> on <unk> n he is n't eligible to be reappointed to the bench at the end of the year
the suit impact on <unk> <unk> may be narrow however
most <unk> <unk> judges are elected and the federal age - discrimination law does n't apply to elected officials said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> regional attorney for the <unk> in <unk> <unk>

the bill is expected to pass in <unk> next month
<unk> temporarily halted <unk> <unk> effort with an appropriation resolution that prohibited him from using budgeted funds to implement his plan
opponents say <unk> <unk> <unk> plan will needlessly break up longtime tightly knit crime - fighting units that have successfully prosecuted major organized - crime figures

some former strike - force personnel say n the units have already begun to break up

<unk> communications <unk> and <unk> <unk> resumed settlement talks on their legal battle over <unk> producers <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> but continued to level strong accusations at each other in legal documents
<unk> has filed a n billion breach of contract suit in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> against <unk> and the <unk> - <unk> duo who in turn are countersuing <unk> for trying to interfere in <unk> acquisition of <unk> pictures <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in two transactions valued at over n billion
although settlement talks had been dropped attorneys for the two sides apparently began talking again yesterday in an attempt to settle the matter before <unk> when a judge is expected to rule on <unk> request for an injunction that would block the two producers from taking over the management of <unk>
yesterday in documents filed in connection with that case <unk> accused <unk> officials of falsely claiming that they never read the five - year contract requiring the two producers to make movies exclusively for <unk> citing securities and <unk> <unk> filings made by <unk> that described the contracts
<unk> was referring to documents filed last week in which <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> president of its <unk> <unk> unit said <unk> they had taken <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> at their word when the producers told them that getting out of the contract would be no problem because of a previous oral agreement
<unk> <unk> an attorney at <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> representing <unk> said <unk> the <unk> executives had n't seen the contract because it was n't relevant once <unk> and <unk> told them <unk> <unk> would let them terminate it at any time
<unk> <unk> said <unk> statements about the contract made in <unk> filings were made by attorneys who did have access to the contracts but who were n't part of the negotiations between <unk> and the duo
<unk> executives also filed new sworn affidavits denying claims by messrs. <unk> and <unk> that the two sides had an oral agreement that enabled the producers to terminate their contract with <unk> should the opportunity to run a major studio come up
but <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> intends to prove that the oral agreement did in fact exist and that even the existing written contract does n't preclude the producers from taking executive posts at another studio
<unk> described as nonsense yesterday <unk> assertions in prior court filings that <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> could in theory run <unk> while still fulfilling their contract to produce movies for <unk>
such a dual role would be impractical and unethical <unk> said <unk> adding that concept is as silly as suggesting that the head coach of the <unk> <unk> dodgers could simultaneously be general manager of the <unk> <unk> giants
<unk> which is in the process of being acquired by <unk> <unk> - based <unk> <unk> <unk> also said n it paid the two producers a fixed annual salary of n million

<unk> an investor group led by <unk> <unk> - based <unk> <unk> associates had itself filed a suit in state court in <unk> <unk> seeking to nullify the agreement
earlier this year <unk> had rejected a <unk> a share offer from <unk> saying n it was n't adequately financed
<unk> last week launched a new n offer for the <unk> <unk> <unk> computer printer maker
<unk> said <unk> it could n't comment on the suit
<unk> <unk> third - quarter profit leaped n but <unk> <unk> attention was focused on the picket line not the bottom line
in fact the earnings report unfolded as representatives of the world no . n jet maker and the striking machinists union came back to the negotiating table for their first meeting in two weeks
<unk> <unk> the federal mediator in <unk> where <unk> is based said n the parties will continue to sit down daily until a new settlement proposal emerges or the talks break off again
despite the progress <unk> indicated that the work stoppage now in its <unk> day will have a serious adverse impact on the current quarter
for the third quarter net rose to n million or <unk> a share from n million or n cents a share
sales climbed <unk> to n billion from n billion as the company capitalized on the ravenous global demand for commercial airliners
because it impossible to gauge how long the walkout by <unk> machinists rank and file will last the precise impact on <unk> sales earnings cash flow and short - term investment position could n't be determined
the investment community however strongly believes that the strike will be settled before there is any lasting effect on either <unk> or its work force
the company total firm backlog of unfilled orders at <unk> n stood at a mighty n billion compared with n billion at the end
although the company could see fourth - quarter revenue shrink by nearly n billion if it is n't able to deliver any more planes this year those dollars actually would just be deferred until n
and the company is certain to get out some aircraft with just supervisors and other non - striking employees on hand
before the union rejected the company offer and the strike was launched with the graveyard shift of <unk> <unk> <unk> had been counting on turning <unk> aircraft out the door in the present period
that included <unk> of the company n jumbo jets its most successful product
it not a pretty picture said <unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk> associates
but it would just mean a great first and second quarter next year
<unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> added you do n't want to minimize this and say n nobody is looking at it
but the strike has n't gone on long enough for <unk> to lose business in any real sense
that the primary reason n the company share price has held up so well when in <unk> <unk> words most companies would have unraveled by now
in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> composite trading <unk> closed yesterday at <unk> a share off a scant n cents
still <unk> went through its normal verbal gymnastics and played up the downside
in a statement <unk> <unk> <unk> asserted that the company faces significant challenges and risks on both its commercial and government contracts
for instance he noted that spending on <unk> programs is shrinking and <unk> is either the prime contractor or a major supplier on many important military projects including the <unk> <unk> bomber the n <unk> tilt - rotor aircraft and the <unk> <unk> next - generation tactical fighter
because of cost overruns on fixed - price military work <unk> <unk> said <unk> the company defense business will record a significant loss in <unk>
moreover <unk> <unk> added production - rate increases that have been implemented on the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> programs have resulted in serious work force skill - dilution problems
suppliers and subcontractors are experiencing heightened pressure to support delivery schedules
and of course there the unsteady labor situation
besides the machinists pact accords representing n of the company engineering and technical employees in the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> areas expire in early <unk>
also a contract with the <unk> <unk> workers at the company helicopter plant in <unk> expired <unk> n
this contract covering about <unk> hourly production and maintenance workers is being extended on a day - to-day basis
the machinists rejected a proposal featuring a n base wage increase over the life of the three - year contract plus bonuses of <unk> the first year and n the second
on top of that <unk> would make cost - of-living adjustments projected to be n for each year of the contract
the union though has called the offer insulting
the company reiterated yesterday that it willing to reconfigure the package but not add to the substance of it
for the nine months <unk> net increased <unk> to n million or <unk> a share from n million or <unk> a share
sales soared <unk> to n billion from n billion
in a separate matter the <unk> <unk> yesterday said <unk> <unk> agreed to pay the government n million to settle claims that the company provided inaccurate cost information to the <unk> <unk> while negotiating contracts to replace the aluminum skins on the n tanker aircraft
the settlement relates to four contracts negotiated from <unk> to n prosecutors said <unk>
they added that the settlement is the culmination of a n n investigation into the company aluminum pricing practices in connection with n
a <unk> spokesman responded all along the company has said n there was no grounds for criminal prosecution
that was borne out by the <unk> <unk> decision to settle the case
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> filed an application with canadian regulators to build a n billion canadian dollar <unk> n billion pipeline to transport natural gas from <unk> <unk> to <unk> markets beginning
the application by <unk> owned by <unk> - based <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> is expected to kick off what could be a contentious battle for the right to transport vast quantities of gas to southern markets from still - undeveloped fields in <unk> <unk> <unk> delta
this is a pre - emptive strike by <unk> said <unk> <unk> natural gas manager of the <unk> - based <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> an industry group
<unk> wants to make it clear to other pipeline companies that it on first insofar as transporting gas from the <unk> to southern markets <unk> <unk> said
at least two rival applications are expected to emerge in coming months including one from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> largest natural gas pipeline operator
another is expected from a consortium of oil and gas producers who won conditional approval this month from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to export about n trillion cubic feet of <unk> <unk> gas to the <unk> starting in <unk>
the producers include <unk> <unk> <unk> a unit of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> resources <unk> <unk> a unit of <unk> <unk> <unk> which is n by <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> resources <unk> a unit of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the <unk> <unk> <unk> approval of the exports just waved the starting flag for the next stage the rush to build facilities <unk> to transport the gas said <unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> law firm
<unk> main rival <unk> to build a <unk> <unk> pipeline is likely to be <unk> <unk>
the <unk> - based company together with <unk> <unk> of <unk> has had an incomplete proposal filed with canadian regulators since <unk> that it is now updating
like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> consortium plans to build a pipeline directly south from the <unk> <unk> delta in <unk> western <unk> with an initial capacity to transport n billion cubic feet of gas daily
industry sources said <unk> they expect a fierce battle to emerge between <unk> which has a monopoly on canadian gas transportation east of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> which control the pipelines within and running west of <unk> respectively
this is virgin territory unclaimed and it going to be nasty said one observer who asked not to be named
neither is going to back down easily
<unk> declined to comment on the <unk> application
but last week <unk> <unk> president and chief executive officer of <unk> said n the company intends to be a party to any transportation system that goes up there and that it would consider joint ventures with other players to ensure n it has a role
a number of issues still need to be resolved before canadian regulators give any project the final go - ahead
first the price of natural gas will have to almost double
<unk> <unk> president of <unk> said <unk> the company believes n the project would be viable if gas prices reach us$ n a thousand cubic feet by n in current dollars up from a current spot price of about <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> n estimate is somewhat below the n floor price that <unk> - based consulting firm <unk> <unk> <unk> recently said n would be needed for <unk> <unk> gas producers to see a return on their investment
<unk> gas buyers must also decide whether they want to enter firm contracts for <unk> <unk> gas or develop alaskan reserves in the <unk> <unk> area first a project that has been on hold for more than a decade
<unk> <unk> chairman and chief executive of <unk> said n it too early to say whether alaskan or <unk> <unk> gas would flow to market first
but <unk> said n it plans to seek regulatory approval to build an alternative line the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> further north toward <unk>
if that option is favored by gas buyers and regulators <unk> said n it would build another smaller pipeline connecting <unk> <unk> reserves to the <unk> mainline
it also likely that regulators will try to forge some kind of consensus between the would - be pipeline builders before undertaking any hearings into rival projects
<unk> <unk> vice president of <unk> <unk> noted that producers would prefer to avoid hearings into competing proposals that would lengthen the regulatory review process and bog down development
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> an oil pipeline operator rumored to be mulling a gas pipeline proposal of its own said n that is n't in the cards
instead <unk> <unk> president and chief executive of <unk> <unk> - based parent <unk> <unk> <unk> said n the company would prefer to work with other interested parties on a joint proposal
as for <unk> <unk> - emptive bid <unk> <unk> said if they think n it gives them some kind of priority position well that their strategy
the <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> it is delaying approval of <unk> <unk> <unk> proposed n million acquisition of <unk> <unk> banks of <unk> <unk> pending the outcome of an examination into <unk> <unk> lending practices in low - income neighborhoods
the decision reflects the <unk> tougher stance on enforcing the <unk> <unk> <unk> a federal law passed in <unk> to help low - income residents obtain loans
in recent years unions and community groups have won big commitments from banks to make low - interest loans in certain neighborhoods by threatening to hold up proposed acquisitions with protests to the <unk> about reinvestment act compliance
few petitions however have actually delayed or scuttled mergers
the current dispute involves allegations that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has n't lived up to its responsibilities under the reinvestment act
during the summer <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> legal aid group filed a petition with the <unk> on behalf of residents in four <unk> counties
the petition challenged <unk> <unk> lending record in the state saying that the bank - holding company had shut itself off from contact with the low - income community and is redlining almost every black neighborhood that it serves in the state
in deferring action on the merger the <unk> said <unk> the <unk> does not believe that there is sufficient information in the record at this time to allow it to reach a final conclusion on <unk> <unk> record of helping to meet the credit needs of the communities n it serves in <unk> and <unk> <unk> including low to moderate - income neighborhoods in those communities
the <unk> said <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> is expected to begin a <unk> <unk> <unk> examination of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> banking units in the next two weeks
<unk> <unk> with assets of about <unk> billion said n it was disappointed by the delay but said n it would cooperate with regulatory authorities
the bank added that it believes n the review will demonstrate that <unk> <unk> is in compliance with the requirements of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
the company has already missed its initial <unk> n target date for completing the merger
it said yesterday n it still expects to close the acquisition later this year or early in <unk>
<unk> <unk> if acquired would almost double <unk> <unk> banking franchise in <unk> to <unk> billion in assets
that would make it the second - largest bank after <unk> banks <unk> in a state widely considered to be the most lucrative banking market in the country
in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> composite trading yesterday <unk> <unk> shares rose n cents to <unk>
<unk> <unk> stock closed unchanged at n in national over - the-counter trading
earlier this year the <unk> denied an application by <unk> <unk> <unk> to purchase <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> on grounds that <unk> had n't fully complied with the <unk> <unk> <unk>
at the time the <unk> said <unk> the denial the first ever on such grounds signaled the agency new emphasis on the <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> creditors committee backed off a move n to come up with its own alternative proposals to the carrier bankruptcy reorganization plans according to sources familiar with the committee
in a meeting in <unk> <unk> yesterday the committee put on hold instructions n it gave two weeks ago to its experts to explore other options for <unk> future the sources said n
the consultants had been working to finish a report this week
that means n <unk> a unit of <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> can go forward with its pitch for creditor approval as early as today when it is expected to deliver a revised reorganization plan to the committee
the committee intends to meet next week to make a recommendation on the new plan
in another development yesterday creditors were told that <unk> million <unk> they had expected to become available for implementing a reorganization may not materialize according to one source
<unk> <unk> has run into difficulty reselling about n million of debt securities because of problems in the junk bond market the person said n
and plans to raise another n million through changes to an insurance policy have hit a snag the source said n
an <unk> spokesman said the n million will have no effect whatsoever on the asset structure of <unk> plan
forty million in the total scheme of things is not that significant
it is unclear what caused the creditors to do an about - face on exploring alternatives to <unk> new reorganization plan
however since <unk> first filed for chapter n protection <unk> n it has consistently promised to pay creditors n cents on the dollar
because the carrier is still pledging to do that some committee members successfully argued that there little reason yet n to explore a different plan according to one person familiar with the creditors position
earlier this month the accounting firm of <unk> <unk> and the securities firm of <unk> <unk> <unk> the experts hired by the creditors contended that <unk> would have difficulty meeting earnings targets n the airline was projecting
<unk> <unk> said n eastern plan would miss projections by n million
<unk> said <unk> <unk> would miss the same mark by at least n million
the consultants maintained <unk> <unk> would n't generate the cash n it needs and would have to issue new debt to meet its targets under the plan
<unk> at the time disputed those assessments and called the experts report completely off base
yesterday <unk> <unk> an attorney for <unk> creditors committee declined to comment on whether the experts had ever been instructed to look at other choices and whether they now were asked not to
he said only that the committee has not yet taken any position on <unk> reorganization plan and that the two sides were still negotiating
in every case people would like to see a consentual plan he said
<unk> and its creditors agreed in <unk> on a reorganization plan that called for the carrier to sell off n billion in assets and to emerge from chapter n status in late n at two - thirds its former size
<unk> eventually decided not to sell off a major chunk its south american routes which were valued at n million
such a change meant <unk> the reorganization plan <unk> the creditors had agreed on was no longer valid and the two sides had to begin negotiating again
<unk> has publicly stated n it is exceeding its goals for getting back into operation and has predicted n it would emerge from chapter n proceedings early next year operating more flights than it originally had scheduled

west german insurance giant <unk> <unk> entered the takeover battle between <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> said n it won french government approval to buy as much as one - third of <unk> <unk> a diversified financial transport and food holding company
the move comes a week after <unk> announced that it was preparing to bid for <unk> control of <unk> <unk>
<unk> - based <unk> brief explanatory statement said <unk> it is acting to protect its own interests as a shareholder of <unk> <unk>
that would be a blow to both <unk> and <unk> <unk>
each had claimed <unk> <unk> largest insurance company as a tacit ally
the <unk> statement also reinforced the belief that the takeover battle could be a long one
it led to broad market speculation that <unk> now will sweeten its bid which is expected to be formally launched later this week after approval from french government regulators
<unk> entry reflects the increasing eagerness of west german companies looking ahead to the reduction in <unk> <unk> internal barriers in <unk> to get involved in what until now were considered internal french affairs
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> all also have expressed eagerness to expand in <unk> before <unk>
<unk> <unk> this month moved to acquire <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a small french merchant bank that <unk> <unk> had looked at and passed over
<unk> had hoped to buy a stake in <unk> <unk> until the socialists returned to government last year and canceled plans to privatize the large french bank
<unk> <unk> has actively sought a french acquisition for at least two years
lately analysts say <unk> <unk> <unk> has shocked some in the french financial community by indicating <unk> it wants a strong bank with a large number of branches
we are still looking said a <unk> <unk> spokesman
the banks n we think n would fit into our concept are either government - owned or not for sale though <unk> <unk> would be able to pay a good price
while <unk> officials were n't willing to comment in any detail on their plans they said <unk> <unk> currently holds between <unk> and <unk> of <unk> <unk> an apparent increase from the <unk> stake that <unk> <unk> officials had earlier announced
<unk> market sources said n they believed n <unk> was buying yesterday morning and <unk> <unk> moved up <unk> francs n to close at <unk> francs in heavy trading
it was the first day of trading following the suspension of <unk> <unk> shares last <unk> when <unk> announced its plan to pay <unk> francs for each <unk> <unk> share
<unk> also holds a <unk> stake in <unk> <unk> insurance subsidiary one of <unk> largest insurance groups which it bought for about n billion francs just before <unk> launched its bid
<unk> <unk> holds the remaining n
<unk> said in its statement that it was acting to protect that interest which ties it to <unk> <unk> as a partner
<unk> statement stressed the company previously announced position that <unk> offer price is too low
<unk> also suggested without saying so directly that it regrets that <unk> is n't bidding for all of <unk> <unk> shares
the problem here analysts say <unk> is that if <unk> wins its <unk> remaining <unk> <unk> shares will fall in value
that displeases many current holders such as <unk> which could n't be sure of selling all their shares if they tendered to <unk>
the <unk> statement led to speculation that <unk> eventually could sell to <unk>
that would be bad news for <unk> <unk> current management which was counting on <unk> to help fend off <unk>
<unk> did n't say whom if anyone it will support
it said simply that it will boost its <unk> <unk> stake as it sees fit over the coming days to protect itself as long as it has french regulatory officials approval
<unk> currently intends to offer n francs a share for <unk> <unk> shares that receive full dividends this year
it is to offer n francs for shares created on <unk> <unk> which receive partial dividends
alternatively it would offer to swap three <unk> shares for one <unk> <unk> share
<unk> already holds about n of <unk> <unk> and the acquisition of the additional <unk> would cost it about n billion francs under its current bid
the bid values <unk> <unk> at around n billion francs depending on how many holders of <unk> <unk> warrants exchange them for shares before the bid expires
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> it agreed in principle to acquire <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> unit for n million
the company said <unk> <unk> <unk> based in <unk> <unk> is a leading supplier of electrical and electronic wire and cable for the distributor retail and original equipment manufacturer markets
<unk> <unk> which operates n manufacturing plants had operating profit of n million on sales of n million for the first six months of this year and operating profit of n million on sales of n million for all of <unk>
the maker of telecommunications and defense equipment said <unk> <unk> <unk> portfolio and market focus would complement the company current wire and cable businesses
the plan is subject to a satisfactory due diligence investigation of <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> a definitive agreement and regulatory approvals

singer <unk> <unk> won a <unk> federal court jury verdict against <unk> <unk> in a case that threatens a popular advertising industry practice of using sound - alike performers to tout products
the decision in <unk> <unk> federal court stems from a <unk> <unk> <unk> tv ad that <unk> <unk> worked up for <unk> <unk> <unk>
the ad agency had approached <unk> <unk> about appearing but she declined citing a longstanding policy of refusing advertising work
the agency then turned to a former backup singer for <unk> <unk> who appeared in the ad and crooned what was generally considered a more than credible imitation of <unk> <unk> <unk> hit song <unk> you <unk> <unk>
the appeals court held when a distinctive voice of a professional singer is widely known and is deliberately imitated in order to sell a product the sellers have appropriated what is not theirs
the judge in the jury trial said n there was insufficient evidence n to hold <unk> liable in the case
in a statement <unk> <unk> called the award unfortunate but bearable
<unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> lawyer for <unk> <unk> said we believe that the verdict reaffirms her position and our position that advertisers and advertising agencies can not with impunity imitate the voices of well - known performers
that is a property right that belongs to the performer
the award although far less than the <unk> million including punitive damages that <unk> <unk> sought is likely to force <unk> <unk> to further rethink how they use famous songs in ads
last year appeals court decision for instance spawned several suits reportedly including a recent action by the heirs of singer <unk> <unk> against <unk> <unk> over its <unk> <unk> <unk> commercials a rough parody of <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> trademark
the appeals - court decision last year was particularly surprising because the same court had dismissed a similar case in <unk> involving singer <unk> <unk> and a tire ad also a <unk> <unk> product
<unk> <unk> sued over the use of her these boots are made for walkin song in the ad
at that time the court held that such a claim would interfere with federal copyright law which has always cracked down on the unauthorized copying of songs and musical compositions but never actual performances
one thing that is a little unnerving is that you had three old men on the court of appeals in <unk> coming up with a statement that <unk> <unk> is not distinctive but that <unk> <unk> is
i am not sure that judges many of whom i like very much are proper repositories for making distinctions about pop singers said <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> advertising lawyer
nonetheless <unk> <unk> said that the latest decisions are having a chilling effect
it has made people think twice about how they use music and is forcing them to be more circumspect about doing a particular rendition of a song in its most famous form he said

the media treatment of the <unk> <unk> during the <unk> <unk> the <unk> administration denigration of the military and the public scapegoating of <unk> . <unk> . <unk> <unk> have all served to emasculate the poor souls who live there
the resulting haunted house tends to reward followership not leadership it creates guilt about wearing the uniform and raises doubt about having the will to fulfill the ghosts role i.e. to be able to win if called on
perhaps the <unk> season is a good time for <unk> to be looking at funding for some ghostbusting equipment

the <unk> <unk> <unk> was hired largely because he was credited with returning <unk> <unk> airlines <unk> to profitability while he was its president from <unk> to n

it is a peaceful time in this part of western <unk>
the summer crop is harvested winter sowing has yet to begin
farmers in loose turbans and fancy earrings spend their afternoons laughing and gossiping at the markets
one could imagine such a lull in the lives of the arabs before the quadrupling of oil prices
for just as the arabs were in the <unk> the farmers of <unk> are on the brink of global power and fame
the arabs had merely oil
these farmers may have a grip on the world very heart
or at least its heart disease
that is because <unk> has a near - monopoly on the world supply of flea seed also known as flea wort or in western parlance psyllium a tiny tasteless obscure seed that according to early research may reduce cholesterol levels in the blood
ever since the link to cholesterol was disclosed americans have begun scarfing up psyllium in their breakfast cereals
if further research proves the seed benefits this dusty farm district could become the epicenter of a health - food fad n to rival all fads since cod - liver oil
this seed not grown anywhere else in <unk> or anywhere else in the world says <unk> <unk> a vice president of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a major psyllium buyer and promoter
the proper climatic conditions do n't exist in many places in the world
<unk> <unk> a processor and exporter of the seed raves if psyllium takes the place of oat bran it will be huge
whether psyllium makes <unk> fortune depends on cholesterol - fearing americans the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and of course the outcome of further research
only one thing is certain here <unk> is likely to remain solely an export item from <unk> for a long time
local farmers say n it is as good a cash crop as mustard or fenugreek a legume
but they have no desire to eat a bowl of psyllium each morning and perhaps little need lean frugal vegetarians the farmers are innocents in the clogged treacherous world of cholesterol
psyllium is an annual herb <unk> ovata that has been used for centuries by folk doctors here mainly as a laxative and anti - diarrheal
as such the soluble fiber has an almost fanatic following in northern <unk>
i can assure you attests a n lawyer in <unk> <unk> with a meaningfully raised eyebrow from personal experience n it works
a prominent businessman in <unk> gives a similar testimonial i have been taking it daily since <unk>
folk doctors also prescribe it for kidney bladder and urethra problems duodenal ulcers and hemorrhoids
some apply it to gouty joints
the plant has a hairy stem that produces flowers and diminutive seeds
it is the seed colorlessness and size n of them weigh only n grams or about as much as two paper clips that explain the historical allusions to fleas
the transluscent husk of the seed is removed sifted and crushed the seed itself is fed to animals
some n of the crop which was worth n million last year is exported
for decades psyllium husk has been the main ingredient in such laxatives as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the top - selling brand in the <unk> and <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk>
but some time ago researchers discovered that soluble fibers also lower cholesterol levels in the blood
<unk> - based <unk> took an interest it ordered two studies on psyllium and cholesterol
one of the studies done at the <unk> of <unk> tested n people with raised cholesterol levels
after n weeks the group that took three daily teaspoons of <unk> saw a significant dip in their general cholesterol levels and an even larger reduction in levels of low - density lipoproteins the so - called bad cholesterol
in late <unk> <unk> asked the <unk> for approval to market <unk> as the first non - prescription cholesterol - lowering product in
in <unk> the psyllium bandwagon got more crowded
<unk> mills <unk> the food giant launched a breakfast cereal called <unk> containing psyllium oat wheat and beet bran the words reduce cholesterol were prominently displayed on its package
in <unk> <unk> <unk> launched a competing psyllium - fortified cereal called <unk>
suddenly on television in advertisements and on their cereal boxes americans were inundated with news about the obscure seed
the flood of claims and counter - claims worried consumers and actually hurt sales of the new cereals
this month the <unk> and <unk> <unk> expressed concern that americans might someday in various forms ingest too much psyllium
currently there is a lull in the psyllium war
the <unk> has asked <unk> and <unk> mills to show research that their cereals are safe
it also ordered <unk> to produce more studies n to buttress its claims that <unk> can lower cholesterol
but the agency has n't yanked psyllium off store shelves
if the <unk> approves the new uses of psyllium other companies are expected to rush to market with psyllium products
it going to be a sensational thing says <unk> <unk> of <unk> in <unk>
says psyllium exporter <unk> <unk> i just got back yesterday from the <unk>
in the newspapers on the radio and tv psyllium is everywhere
but the news of the boom has yet to trickle down to the farmers
they only know of one use for the crop as a laxative and with psyllium prices currently languishing in the wake of a bumper crop they think of the seed as a marginal crop something n to grow between summer wheat crops
psyllium not a good crop complains <unk> <unk> a n farmer from the village of <unk>
you get a rain at the wrong time and the crop is ruined
even at the <unk> chemicals pharmaceuticals and cosmetics <unk> <unk> <unk> the government agency that promotes the seed the psyllium boom is distant thunder
the staff brags about psyllium hefty contribution to american regularity without quite grasping the implications of the research on cholesterol
the council annual report has psyllium on its last page lumped with such unglamorous export items as sarsaparilla and <unk> vomica a plant that induces vomiting
in one way the psyllium middlemen the buyers and exporters are glad to keep news of the boom to themselves
they want psyllium prices low for their purchases next year
but there a catch
<unk> and adjacent districts are the only places in the world where psyllium is grown in large quantities
this is partly due to the particular demands of the crop
psyllium needs sandy soil dew during the first few weeks and then total dryness when its seeds are maturing
small crops are grown in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but their quality ca n't compare to that of indian psyllium
big buyers like <unk> <unk> say n there are other spots on the globe and in <unk> where the seed could be grown
it not a crop that ca n't be doubled or tripled says <unk> <unk>
but no one has made a serious effort to transplant the crop
in <unk> it is almost time n to sow this year crop
many farmers too removed to glean psyllium new sparkle in the <unk> have decided to plant mustard fennel cumin fenugreek or castor - oil seeds
<unk> <unk> is thinking of passing up psyllium altogether this year in favor of a crop with a future such as cumin or fennel
maybe i plant castor - oil seeds
his brother <unk> whose head is swathed in a gorgeous crimson turban nods vigorous assent
so when next year psyllium crop is harvested in <unk> it may be smaller than the <unk> metric tons of the past few years right at the crest of the psyllium boom
and the world could experience its first psyllium shortage

small businesses say n a recent trend is like a dream come true more - affordable rates for employee - health insurance initially at least
but then they wake up to a nightmare
the reasonable first - year rates can be followed by increases of n or more if a covered employee files a major claim they complain
insurance premiums for one small <unk> concern went up <unk> in less than two years the last increase coming after one of its three workers developed a herniated disk
there a distinct possibility that i may lose my job over this the employee <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> recently told a congressional hearing
she said n her employer ca n't afford the rate increases and she fears n she wo n't find another job with a benefit plan covering her ailment
for employee and employer alike the worry is widespread
surveys repeatedly show that small - business owners rank the availability and rising cost of health insurance as one of their biggest concerns
the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> health subcommittee headed by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> is looking into complaints that small businesses not only ca n't keep reasonably priced employee - health insurance if claims are filed but often ca n't get coverage at all if a worker is termed medically uninsurable
i have an old - fashioned name for people in that position sick people who need health insurance <unk> <unk> says
what we seeing now makes a mockery of the idea of insurance collect premiums from the healthy dump the sick and let them pay their own bills
some lawmakers may seek legislation n to limit overly restrictive insurance policies
the concern grows out of increased efforts by the insurers to woo the small - business market
as larger companies increasingly self - insure or use reserves to pay their own workers medical bills the insurance industry has turned to the small - employer market that was once a backwater for them
insurance companies will offer a good rate if no one is sick but it a roll of the dice says <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a group representing n small businesses nationwide
one case of cancer or a high - risk pregnancy with a sick infant and rates go up <unk> to n
small - business people end up paying insurance premiums worth two to three times the cost of one illness
in addition the group says n some of its member companies have been denied insurance because individual workers had medical problems that ranged from a mild cardiac condition to psychological counseling after a divorce hemorrhoids and overweight
the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> an insurers trade group acknowledges that stiff competition among its members to insure businesses likely to be good risks during the first year of coverage has aggravated the problem in the small - business market
but it says that rapid rate increases are directly tied to the soaring cost of health care
some business analysts blame the problem on tough competition in the insurance market
they say n insurance companies use policies aimed at excluding bad risks because their competitors do
but the general practice makes it more difficult to combine small groups of people into larger groups thus spreading the risk over a larger base of premiums
i not accusing insurers of dereliction of duty <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> told <unk> <unk> panel
you ca n't ask one carrier to underwrite on social grounds when that might destroy it in the marketplace
<unk> <unk> and democratic <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> have proposed regulation <unk> to deal with the problem
the proposal is just part of legislation that would require businesses to provide health benefits an idea that is strongly opposed by small business who say n it would just compound the insurance - cost problems
but small - business lobbyists say n they support the idea included in the <unk> - <unk> bill of new laws or regulations requiring greater use of community rating which pegs rates to the use of health care by a community or other large group and is designed to prevent insurance companies from taking only low - risk small companies as clients
but first on the list of priorities says n the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> is to prohibit state laws requiring the inclusion of specialty items such as psychiatric care in basic health plans
such requirements they argue <unk> make it difficult to provide a basic low - cost health - benefits package
before the state of <unk> mandated that mental - health care be covered there were only n mental - health clinics in the state now there are <unk> says <unk> <unk> an <unk> lobbyist
she contends that similar mandates have driven up insurance costs <unk> in <unk> and <unk> in <unk>
the insurance - industry association also strongly disagrees with the proposed community rating which does n't save one dollar argues <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> counsel
it just makes healthy businesses subsidize unhealthy ones and gives each employer less incentive to keep his workers healthy
<unk> <unk> says <unk> the <unk> is working on a proposal to establish a privately funded reinsurance mechanism n to help cover small groups that ca n't get insurance without excluding certain employees
the complexities of the insurance problem make the outcome difficult to predict
but to <unk> <unk> the employee whose back problem triggered a huge insurance - rate increase the issue was simple
what good is having health insurance she asked when it so expensive that it becomes impossible n to keep after only one major claim

in the aftermath of the <unk> massacre on <unk> n economists advanced wildly divergent views on how <unk> <unk> would be affected
among the most upbeat was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
in a <unk> n reaction the bankers <unk> <unk> unit proclaimed the economy shockproof
others were more cautious
in a <unk> analysis titled from <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> another securities firm said that eroding confidence might undermine future economic development
today with business activity in <unk> <unk> staggering along at an uneven pace the economy itself seems locked in a struggle between hope and fear
manufacturers have survived the turmoil in <unk> largely unscathed
signs of revival seem evident in <unk> <unk> hard - hit hotel sector
but in the stock and real - estate markets activity remains spotty even though prices have regained much of their lost ground
waning demand reported by importers retailers and even fancy restaurants all reinforce a profile of a community that is sharply tightening its belt
as many economists and businessmen see it those incongruities underscore a paradox that seems likely to bedevil the economy throughout the n
that paradox is <unk> <unk> economically rewarding yet politically perilous relationship with <unk>
as a model of capitalist efficiency on southern <unk> doorstep <unk> <unk> prospects look good
<unk> land and labor offer inexpensive alternatives to local industry
<unk> - bound freight streams through the territory port
in the decade since the communist nation emerged from isolation its burgeoning trade with the <unk> has lifted <unk> <unk> status as a regional business center
these benefits seem secure despite <unk> current economic and political troubles
but to <unk> <unk> <unk> is n't purely business
it is also the sovereign power that come n will take over this british colony
<unk> leaders have promised generous liberties for <unk> <unk> <unk>
that promise sounds shaky now that those same leaders have fallen back on marxist dogma and brute force to crush their nation democracy movement
outflows of people and capital from <unk> <unk> have been growing since the sovereignty issue first arose in the early n
a widely held assumption all along has been that given its robust economy <unk> <unk> will be able to attract sufficient foreign money and talent to comfortably offset the outflows
with interest in emigration and investment abroad soaring since <unk> <unk> that assumption no longer seems so safe
investment and emigration plans take time to come to fruition
only four months have passed since the <unk> massacre and few are prepared to predict its ultimate impact
the only consensus is that more money and people may leave <unk> <unk> than had been thought likely
this expected blow has cast a pall over the economy prospects
the question as many people see it is how long such uncertainty will last
<unk> <unk> an economist with <unk> <unk> a subsidiary of <unk> <unk> <unk> believes that the territory may not be able to regain its momentum until some time after n
it may experience an upswing or two in between
but with local investors shaken by <unk> political and economic turmoil she says n a genuine recovery may not arrive until <unk> <unk> can prove itself secure under chinese sovereignty
investors have to accept the possibility of a significant slowdown in economic activity in the runup to <unk> she says
over the next few years i would advise caution
in a soon - to-be published book on the territory a political economist <unk> <unk> has derived three future scenarios from interviews with <unk> <unk> <unk> government officials and businessmen
nearly half of them argue that <unk> <unk> uneasy relationship with <unk> will constrain though not inhibit long - term economic growth
the rest are split roughly between optimists who expect <unk> <unk> to hum along as before and pessimists who foresee irreparable chaos
the interviews took place two years ago
since the <unk> crisis erupted <unk> <unk> says n the scenario as <unk> depicted by the middle - of-the-road group bears a remarkable resemblance to the difficulties <unk> <unk> <unk> currently faces
the consensus of this group which he dubs realists is that the local economy will grow through the n at annual rates averaging between <unk> and <unk>
such a pace of growth though respectable for mature industrialized economies would be unusually slow for <unk> <unk>
only twice since the <unk> has annual gross domestic product growth here fallen below n for two or more consecutive years
the first instance occurred in <unk> when <unk> <unk> <unk> triggered bloody street rioting in the colony
the other came in <unk> from the combined shock of world recession and a severe local stock market crash
during the past n years <unk> <unk> economic growth has averaged n annually
given <unk> <unk> record <unk> <unk> realists might have sounded unduly conservative when the interviews took place two years ago
under the current circumstances he says n their scenario no longer seems unrealistic
the city could lose some of its entrepreneurial flavor
it could lose some of its dynamism says <unk> <unk> a director of <unk> securities <unk> <unk> <unk> a unit of <unk> <unk> <unk>
it does n't have to be a disaster
it just means that <unk> <unk> would become a less exciting place
going by official forecasts of <unk> which measures the colony output of goods and services minus foreign income <unk> <unk> realists seem relatively close to the mark
after taking into account the fallout from the <unk> crisis the government has projected <unk> <unk> growth of <unk>
the updated forecast published <unk> n compares with an earlier forecast of <unk> published <unk> <unk> and a n rate achieved
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> financial secretary says <unk> a further downward revision may be justified unless the economy stages a more convincing rally
we are n't looking at anything like a doomsday scenario he says
but clearly we entering a difficult period
many factors besides a dread of <unk> will have a bearing on <unk> <unk> economy
one concerns japanese investors
barely visible on <unk> <unk> property scene in <unk> by last year <unk> had become the top foreign investor spending n million
the market has grown relatively quiet since the <unk> crisis
but if the japanese return in force their financial might could compensate to some extent for local investors waning commitment
another and critical factor is the <unk> <unk> <unk> biggest export market
even before the <unk> crisis weak <unk> demand was slowing local economic growth
conversely strong consumer spending in the <unk> two years ago helped propel the local economy at more than twice its current rate
indeed a few economists maintain that global forces will continue to govern <unk> <unk> economic rhythm
once external conditions such as <unk> demand swing in the territory favor they argue <unk> local businessmen will probably overcome their n worries and continue doing business as usual
but economic arguments however solid wo n't necessarily impress <unk> <unk> n million people
many are refugees having fled <unk> unending cycles of political repression and poverty since the <unk> <unk> took power in <unk>
as a result many of those now planning to leave <unk> <unk> ca n't easily be swayed by momentary improvements in the colony political and economic climate
emigration applications soared in <unk> when <unk> and <unk> ratified their accord on <unk> <unk> future
in <unk> <unk> <unk> most prosperous year for a decade <unk> left up n from the previous year
last year n went
the government predicts that annual outflows will level off over the next few years at as much as <unk> a projection that is widely regarded as unrealistically low
a large number of those leaving are managers and professionals
while no one professes to know the exact cost of such a brain drain to the economy hardly anyone doubts that it poses a threat
when the economy loses a big portion of its work force that also happens to include its most productive members economic growth is bound to be affected says <unk> <unk> an economist with <unk> <unk> <unk>
while <unk> <unk> is retreating from computer - driven program trading big institutional investors are likely to continue these strategies at full blast further roiling the stock market trading executives say n
bowing to a mounting public outcry three more major securities firms <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> announced <unk> <unk> they would suspend stock - index arbitrage trading for their own accounts
<unk> <unk> <unk> announced a pullback on <unk> from stock - index arbitrage a controversial program - trading strategy blamed by many investors for encouraging big stock - market swings
though the trading halts are offered as a sign of concern about recent stock market volatility most <unk> <unk> firms remain open to handle program trading for customers
trading executives privately say that huge stock - index funds which dwarf <unk> <unk> firms in terms of the size of their program trades will continue to launch big programs through the stock market
<unk> <unk> <unk> advisers <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> are among the top stock - index arbitrage clients of <unk> <unk> trading executives say
these huge stock - index funds build portfolios that match the <unk> <unk> stock index or other stock indexes and frequently swap between stocks and futures to capture profits
they will do it every chance n they get said one program - trading executive
consequently abrupt swings in the stock market are not likely to disappear anytime soon they say n
in fact without <unk> <unk> firms trading for their own accounts the stock - index arbitrage trading opportunities for the big funds may be all the more abundant
more customers may come to us now said <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> <unk>
executives who manage these funds see the current debate over program trading as a repeat of the concern expressed after the <unk> crash
they noted that studies completed after the <unk> crash exonerated program trading as a source of volatility
the issues that are now being raised in classic anti - intellectual fashion fly in the face of a number of post - crash studies said <unk> <unk> chairman of <unk> <unk> <unk> advisers
a bankers <unk> spokesman said that the company investment arm uses stock - index arbitrage to enhance investors returns
officials at <unk> <unk> were unavailable for comment
stock - index funds have grown in popularity over the past decade as pension funds and other institutional investors have sought a low - cost way n to match the performance of the stock market as a whole
many money managers who trade stock actively have trouble consistently matching the n returns
some stock - index funds are huge
<unk> <unk> <unk> advisers for example managed <unk> billion in stock investments tracking the <unk> <unk> at the end of <unk> according to <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> billion of that is used in active index arbitrage
stock - index funds frequently use the futures markets as a hedging tool but that is a far less aggressive strategy than stock - index arbitrage in which traders buy and sell big blocks of stocks with offsetting trades in stock - index futures to profit from price differences
the n plunge in the stock market <unk> <unk> has heightened concerns about volatility
and while signs of an economic slowdown softer corporate earnings and troubles with takeover financing all have contributed to the stock market recent weakness many investors rushed to blame program trading for aggravating market swings
the <unk> <unk> firms pullback followed their recent blacklisting by several institutional investors
last <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> services <unk> unit said n it would no longer trade with firms committed to stock - index arbitrage including the three that later suspended stock - index arbitrage trading on <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> also cut off brokerage firms that engage in program trading
though it is still doing stock - index arbitrage trades for customers <unk> <unk> trading halt for its own account is likely to shake up firms such as <unk> <unk> <unk> that still do such trades for their own account
<unk> <unk> has consistently been one of the top stock - index arbitrage traders in recent months
indeed <unk> <unk> president <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> the firm is putting up money n to form a group of regulators investors and investment banks to find out if stock - index arbitrage artificially induces stock - market volatility
we have to clear up these issues and find out what is present that is creating artificial volatility <unk> <unk> said <unk>
there is no question that investor confidence in the stock market is critical
joining the call for some kind of study or regulatory action <unk> <unk> <unk> recommended program - trading reforms late <unk> including higher margins on stock - index futures and greater regulatory coordination
separately <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> said <unk> his firm is working with regulators to balance margin requirements to enhance stabilization
margin rules determine the minimum amount of cash n an investor must put up when buying a security
current rules permit investors to put up less cash for futures than for stocks
some observers say that different rules governing stock and futures markets are partly responsible for volatility
these rules they say n permit faster and cheaper trading in futures than in stocks which frequently knocks the two markets out of line
stock - index arbitrage because it sells the more expensive market and buys the cheaper one attempts to reestablish the link between the stock and futures markets and the adjustments are often abrupt
but unequal trading rules allow the futures market to trade differently from stocks which invites frequent bouts of stock - index arbitrage in the first place
there has to be better coordination on a regulatory basis said <unk> <unk> director of trading at <unk> - <unk> securities <unk>
one agency should have the authority over all equity products
like so many trends in the entertainment industry the current spate of rape dramas on television seems to represent a confluence of high - mindedness and self - interest
the former comes from the latest wave of political activism in <unk> especially around feminist issues such as abortion
the latter comes from the perception on the part of many people in network tv that their only hope of keeping viewers from defecting to cable is to fill the airwaves with an increasingly raw sensationalism
put these together and you get programs about rape
the best of the crop was last week season premiere of in the <unk> of the <unk> the <unk> series based on a n feature film about a black <unk> police detective in a small southern town
in the series <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and his wife <unk> <unk> - <unk> <unk> have settled in <unk> <unk>
because the show has acquired a sense of place by being filmed on location in <unk> this episode in which <unk> gets raped by an arrogant white schoolteacher does a decent job of tracing the social repercussions of the crime
obviously it harder to establish a sense of place in a one - shot tv movie
but tonight offering <unk> the score n p.m. <unk> on <unk> does n't even try
this tale of a <unk> policewoman returning home to find the man who raped her n years earlier is supposed to be set in the ozarks
but it more like an illustration of what <unk> <unk> describes in his study of social attitudes in the tv industry <unk> of violence and animosity because of race or religion fear and lack of comprehension about the politics of small - town people produce a powerful wave of dislike of small towns in the minds of tv writers and producers
the writer and executive producer of <unk> the score <unk> <unk> is a graduate of <unk> who participated in a <unk> documentary aired this summer in which six members of the <unk> class of <unk> ruminated about their lives since graduation
at one point in the documentary <unk> <unk> who is jewish says <unk> he felt rejected by many of the protestants and southerners n he met at <unk>
he quotes one student saying you just the kind of <unk> n we southerners ca n't stand
<unk> <unk> confesses that it was partly in response to such attitudes that he is now a dweller on one of the two islands off the coast of <unk>
but is exile in <unk> enough
not to judge by <unk> the score in which <unk> <unk> seems to be settling a score of his own
of all the unflattering portraits of small - town <unk> <unk> i seen on tv this film is the most gratuitously nasty
the sole sympathetic character is the prodigal daughter <unk> <unk> <unk> and she is tolerable only by virtue of having nothing in common with her kinfolk a truly benighted pack of southern protestants whose grim existence consists mostly of growing peaches and repressing sex
i mean <unk> these folks are so uptight that they blame pretty <unk> for the fact that when she was a teen - ager someone tied her hands behind her back thrust her head into a gunny sack brutally raped and beat her and then left her to die in a cold - storage room
her <unk> <unk> <unk> is the kind of guy who while saying grace at the supper table pauses at the word sin and glares at the daughter <unk> he has n't seen for two decades because he knows in his heart that she enjoyed what happened in the cold - storage room and has been indulging the same taste ever since in the fleshpots of <unk>
people like <unk> do exist of course
but in <unk> <unk> <unk> he is but the tip of the patriarchal iceberg
every man n <unk> encounters is either sniggeringly puritanical viciously patronizing revoltingly lecherous or all three
add the fact that any one of them including <unk> could be her attacker and you have a setting that does n't resemble small - town <unk> or even <unk> nightmare of small - town <unk> so much as a paranoid feminist dystopia like <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> itself soon to be you guessed it a <unk> movie
there are two exceptions <unk> <unk> <unk> the local doctor who has always loved <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> simple - minded but affectionate brother
<unk> makes clumsy passes at <unk> when she seething with anger and fear but we know from the outset that he not a member of the evil patriarchy
how could he be
he the director of the local <unk> <unk> chapter
as for <unk> if you ca n't guess why he so sweet to his sister when everybody else hates her then i not going to tell you
as for the women they pathetic
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is a moral coward
her sister - in-law <unk> <unk> is a sniveling prude afraid that <unk> will seduce all the married men in town including a particularly loathsome fellow named <unk> whose idea of fun is to leave his wife at home tending to her bruises and cigarette burns while he bullies <unk> into a dance that consists of drooling on her while trying to break her ribs
at the very least it would appear that <unk> is a poor judge of masculine charm
yet even these insulting caricatures are not as bad as the moral hypocrisy at the heart of <unk> the score
in the aforementioned episode of in the <unk> of the <unk> we saw <unk> being attacked but we were n't invited to enjoy the spectacle
in <unk> <unk> film by contrast we are urged to share the perverse excitement of the rapist creeping up on his victim as the camera ogles <unk> in various stages of undress and lingers on the sight of her trussed - up body during frequent flashbacks to the rape
at this point the truce between feminism and sensationalism gets mighty uneasy
take the scene in which <unk> stands naked by a lighted window whispering to her hidden assailant look all n you want
starting tomorrow i stalking you
or the one in which she and <unk> are stranded in the city and after insisting on separate motel rooms she knocks on his door to pour out her feelings about the rape wearing nothing but a mini - slip and a push - up bra
surely the question is obvious
with friends like <unk> <unk> do the feminists of <unk> need enemies
<unk> <unk> <unk> stock plummeted after management recommended a suspension of dividend payments on both its common and preferred stock because <unk> may not meet the new government capital criteria effective <unk> n
in composite trading on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> closed at <unk> down <unk> a n decline
a spokesman said <unk> the savings bank may not qualify for the capital requirements because under the proposed guidelines its n million of preferred stock does n't meet the core capital criteria outlined under the new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk>
he added that final guidelines to be published in early <unk> will determine whether the bank is in compliance
<unk> said <unk> it retained three investment bankers <unk> to assist it in developing and implementing a financial restructuring plan
it would n't identify the bankers
additionally <unk> reported a third - quarter loss of n million or <unk> a share compared with net income of n million or <unk> a share a year ago
a major factor in the third - quarter loss was the write - down of n million of goodwill
the spokesman said that the proposed guidelines caused <unk> to revise its business objectives and consequently to write down the asset value of some previous acquisitions
<unk> recorded an additional n million in loan loss reserves in the third quarter
net interest income for the third quarter declined to n million from n million a year ago
however non - interest income rose to n million from n million
third - quarter loan originations dropped sharply to n million from n billion a year ago
<unk> <unk> <unk> lowered the rating on <unk> preferred stock to double - c from single - b-minus and placed it on <unk> for possible further downgrade
it also placed on <unk> for possible downgrade other securities including the double - <unk> rating of <unk> certificates of deposit and the single - b rating of its senior subordinated capital notes
about n million of debt is affected
the envelope arrives in the mail
open it and two soulful eyes on a boy brown face peer out from the page pleadingly
does the tyke have a good mind about to be wasted
is he a victim of <unk> - <unk> cuts
no but he endangered all the same his new sitcom on <unk> needs a following to stay on the air
<unk> has n't had much luck with shows featuring blacks in recent years and the producers of one new arrival are a bit desperate
<unk> a show about a black ad executive who gives up the boardroom for a fourth - grade classroom is flunking the ratings test
so producers <unk> and <unk> <unk> spun their rolodexes and gathered names of black opinion makers to mount a direct - mail campaign
by wooing a core black audience they figure n they might keep the show alive at least until the spring semester
using direct mail for a tv show is like fishing for whale with a breaded hook
it just is n't done
but employing this kind of gut - wrenching plea to black consciousness makes it even more unusual
still <unk> <unk> thinks <unk> he can reach a good chunk of the three million - plus black homes n he needs by mailing to the almost n blacks who form what he calls the grapevine
the grapevine is n't organized but you and i know n it exists says <unk> <unk> referring to the often uncannily small world of black professionals and community leaders
this is a very personal ethnic style <unk> <unk> says
i want people in the barber shops and the beauty shops and standing in line at the rib joints to be talking about the show
i want white <unk> to talk about it too but i convinced that the grapevine is what happening
<unk> says n it is aware of the producers action but the mailing was sent without the network blessing
the letter in fact takes a jab at <unk> for being a laggard in black programming
meanwhile as the <unk> evening show struggles to stay afloat against the tough competition of <unk> <unk> wrote the grapevine idea is threatening to turn into a weed the tactic apparently has inspired sample viewings but accolades are slow in coming
<unk> <unk> a black advertising executive who tracks black viewing patterns gives the carews an a for marketing moxie but is n't alone in his lukewarm reaction
some shows just do n't impress he says n and this is one of them
<unk> <unk> <unk> said n it plans to shift its headquarters to <unk> <unk> from <unk> next year to cut costs and be closer to the upstream natural - gas industry
<unk> <unk> president and chief executive officer of the natural - gas pipeline and marketing concern said <unk> the company future growth is increasingly linked to decisions made by <unk> - based gas producers
since deregulation of the market in <unk> producers have become much more intensely involved in both transportation and marketing <unk> <unk> said
it a matter of being close to those suppliers many of those companies do n't know us as well as they should
<unk> transports all gas that moves eastward from <unk>
that includes all the gas consumed in <unk> and <unk> along with the bulk of canadian gas exports to
<unk> <unk> vice president of <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> - based gas marketing concern said <unk> the industry will welcome the move
having more than a token presence here should enhance communications and business relationships <unk> <unk> said
since the cost of transporting gas is so important to producers ability to sell it it helps to have input and access to transportation companies
the move which could cost <unk> as much as n million canadian dollars <unk> n million in relocation and severance payments should be complete by next summer <unk> <unk> said
all <unk> <unk> - based employees will be offered positions in <unk> the company said n
the company will save between <unk> n million and c$ n million annually in office expenses and other administrative costs by moving to <unk> <unk> <unk> added <unk>
part of both the costs and the savings could be passed on to shippers on the <unk> pipeline through tolls which are based on the value of the pipeline system and the cost of operating it
<unk> is n owned by <unk> - based holding company <unk> <unk>
since its founding in <unk> <unk> brothers the standard - bearer of the <unk> <unk> look has eschewed flashy sales promotions and fashion trends the rules that most retailers live by
but with sales growth sluggish and other men stores putting on the heat the venerable retailer can no longer afford such a smug attitude
so two weeks ago thousands of <unk> brothers charge customers customers conditioned to wait for twice - yearly clearance sales got a surprise an invitation to come in and buy any one item for n off
during the four - day promotion shoppers at the <unk> <unk> <unk> store lined up to pay for big - ticket items like coats and suits
that not all
departing from its newspaper ads featuring prim sketches of a suit or a coat <unk> brothers is marketing an updated image in a new campaign that carries the slogan the <unk> of <unk> brothers
one color photo displays a rainbow of dress shirts tied in a knot another picture shows neckties with bold designs
the message is loud and clear this is not your father <unk> brothers
as part of its national ad pitch <unk> brothers will show less preppy women clothes moving away from its floppy - tie business stereotype
one ad shows a bright red jacket paired with a black leather skirt
and the ad copy is cheeky how can you be a <unk> <unk> hot shot without at least one <unk> brothers suit in your portfolio
<unk> brothers hopes that shaking its time - honored traditions will attract more young men and more women and change consumer perceptions about its range of merchandise
we have men who only buy their shirts and underwear here or younger customers who only buy their job interview suit here says <unk> <unk> chairman and chief executive officer of <unk> brothers
we want them to buy more of their wardrobe here
industry watchers agree that <unk> brothers is long overdue in updating its buttoned - down image which has stunted its growth
when acquired in <unk> n by british retailer <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> brothers annual operating profit was about n million on sales of n million
<unk> <unk> concedes that since the n million takeover sales growth has n't been dramatic
for the n months ended <unk> <unk> operating profit at the n chain totaled n million on sales of n million
as <unk> brothers jumps into the fashion fray it will be playing catch up
many clothiers especially <unk> <unk> have cashed in on the recent popularity of updated <unk> <unk> and english styles
in keeping with men broader fashion scope today businessmen are dabbling in <unk> and italian suits that are conservative but not stodgy
the rigid <unk> <unk> customer <unk> brothers bread and butter meanwhile is becoming extinct
thus <unk> brothers has lost customers to stores that offer more variety such as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> brothers no longer has a lock on the <unk> <unk> customer who is status - conscious about his clothes says <unk> <unk> president of the <unk> <unk> a traditional men store in <unk> <unk>
by making a break from tradition <unk> brothers is seeking a delicate balance
if it promotes fashion too much the shop risks alienating its old - line customers by emphasizing value it risks watering down its high - minded mystique
fashion industry consultants also question whether the company can make significant strides in its women business given that its customer base is less established and that conservative business dress for women is on the decline
<unk> brothers aim is for n of total sales to come from the women department up from the current n
everybody forgets that there are fashion cycles in classic merchandise observes <unk> <unk> a retail consultant
for women dressing for success in a real structured way is over
despite these challenges <unk> <unk> sees big potential in <unk> brothers noting the widely recognized name and global presence
<unk> <unk> plans to open roughly <unk> more <unk> stores in the next five years
<unk> brothers says <unk> business is robust at its <unk> outlets in <unk> and two shops in <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is also considering opening stores across <unk> sometime in the future
<unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> says that <unk> brothers focus is to boost sales by broadening its merchandise assortment while keeping its traditional emphasis
the british parent is also streamlining <unk> brothers which continues to make almost all of its merchandise recently shut one of its two shirt plants in <unk> <unk> and has closed boys departments in all but <unk> stores
<unk> brothers is also remodeling its stores
<unk> it will unveil a n million refurbishing at its flagship store on <unk> <unk>
with newly installed escalators the store retains its signature wood - and-brass look but is less intimidating
more shirts and sweaters will be laid out on tables instead of sitting behind glass cases so that customers can walk up and touch them <unk> <unk> says <unk>
because the biggest growth in menswear is in casual sportswear <unk> brothers is chasing more of that business
the entire second floor of its <unk> <unk> store is now casual sportswear featuring items such as ski sweaters leather backpacks and a <unk> wool baseball hat with the store crest
the centerpiece of the overhaul according to <unk> <unk> is the men tailored clothing department where <unk> brothers has added new suit styles and fabrics
the perception out there is that we are very conservative and we only sell one type of suit <unk> <unk> says referring to <unk> brothers signature three - button sack suit with a center - vented jacket and boxy fit
but it now offers more two - button versions and suits with a tapered fit
it also plans to add suits cut for athletic men with broader upper bodies
next spring nearly n of its suits will have pleated pants compared with virtually none a couple of years ago
says <unk> <unk> we want to turn the customer on
<unk> <unk> said n it will buy back as many as one million common shares

in the <unk> statement <unk> <unk> said n leaving <unk> was a very difficult decision but added that it is now time for a change
the n million purchase of <unk> represented an audacious international move for <unk> which then was about half the <unk> concern size
at the time <unk> <unk> said <unk> his friendship with <unk> <unk> had smoothed the way for its link with the small british company

both offers are conditional on regulatory approvals and enough shares being tendered to give the bidders a majority of <unk> shares outstanding

after days of intense but fruitless negotiations a federal judge last week threatened to convert <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> personal bankruptcy case into a chapter n liquidation
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> raised the possibility after talks n to end a feud between two major creditors failed and all three reorganization plans in the case ran into roadblocks
if the case is converted to chapter n what remains of the oil tycoon once - vast estate now believed to have a value of less than n million would be sold off quickly with most of the proceeds going to the <unk> <unk> <unk> whose claim for n million in back taxes has priority in the case
hundreds of smaller creditors could get nothing according to attorneys involved
while admitting <unk> such a move would be devastating to most creditors <unk> <unk> told a courtroom filled with nearly two dozen attorneys that he was concerned about the toll n mounting legal bills will take on <unk> <unk> shrinking estate and about the fact that following voting by creditors none of the reorganization plans appeared to be viable in their present form
it would be a shame to have a chapter n after all the progress in this case said <unk> <unk>
under chapter n of the <unk> <unk> <unk> a company continues to operate under protection from creditors lawsuits while it works out a plan <unk> to pay its debts
under chapter <unk> the assets of a company are sold off to pay creditors
despite his reluctance to take the latter step the judge indicated n he would move quickly after hearing testimony later this week in the bitter dispute between manufacturers <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> a minerals concern owned by the peruvian governmemt
the manufacturers <unk> <unk> unit which is seeking repayment of a n million loan has asked the court to give its claim priority over that of <unk> which won a n million judgment against <unk> <unk> his brother <unk> <unk> <unk> and other defendants last year in a case stemming from their alleged attempts to corner the silver market
while claiming that penalties legal fees and interest have driven the value of its claim to more than n million <unk> has agreed to settle for an allowed claim of as much as n million
but even that is disputed by manufacturers <unk> which in alliance with the <unk> contends that <unk> has already collected more than its actual damages from other defendants in the silver - conspiracy case

all three major creditors the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> voted against and effectively doomed a reorganization plan proposed by <unk> <unk>
a reorganization plan proposed jointly by the <unk> and <unk> <unk> was stalled by a negative vote from <unk>

it is the opinion of <unk> <unk> author of <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> pages n that the world laughs too fast
here is a bible for <unk> watchers complete with pictures of people who say n they had personal relationships with aliens
one photo shows a woman sporting a scar n she says n was made by a laser beam a low - caliber weapon from the looks of the wound
so far anyway our alien visitors seem more intent on brightening our skies than pulverizing us
<unk> <unk> devotes much serious space to the events of <unk> <unk> <unk> when american gunners spotted strange lights in the sky above <unk> <unk>
air - raid sirens sounded the alarm at <unk> <unk> summoning n air wardens to duty
soon all hell broke loose
ground batteries targeting an odd assortment of aircraft traveling at highly unusual speeds opened up a furious fusillade
the sky filled with n shells several of which fell back to <unk> destroying homes and buildings
when the smoke cleared six people were dead three from heart attacks and everyone wondered what in the world they were shooting at
<unk> <unk> who documents these things as best he can provides an official explanation in the form of a memorandum from <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> pounds of ammunition he wrote his commander in chief n were expended on unidentified aircraft flying at speeds as slow as <unk> mph and elevations between <unk> and <unk> feet
well thousands of californians on the scene insisted n the ammo had been uselessly aimed at a large hardy <unk> but you will just have to make your own decision about such sightings
one thing for sure there have been a ton of them and greater beings than the editors of the <unk> <unk> have shown interest
<unk> <unk> a fairly down - to-earth fellow once sent a letter to the chairman of the <unk> services <unk> recommending that there be a committee investigation of the <unk> phenomenon
i think n we owe it to the american people to establish credibility regarding ufos and to produce the greatest possible enlightenment on the subject
<unk> <unk> went further in a n campaign promise if i become president i make every piece of information n this country has about <unk> sightings available to the public and the scientists
i am convinced that ufos exist because i have seen one
but you know about campaign promises
it still does n't look like governments are coughing up everything n they know
still despite their efforts to convince the world that we are indeed alone the visitors do seem to keep coming and like the recent sightings there often a detail or two that suggests n they may actually be a little on the dumb side
for instance witnesses in <unk> say <unk> the pinheaded behemoths and their robot friend after strolling around the city park left behind some rocks
now why you have to ask yourself would intelligent beings haul a bunch of rocks around the universe
or land in <unk> so often
in a <unk> incident a soviet mail plane disappeared off the radar screen just after radioing its position to ground control in <unk>
a search party soon found the unscathed aircraft in a forest clearing much too small to have allowed a conventional landing
what more the seven mail personnel aboard were missing
again you have to ask the obvious question why would intelligent beings kidnap seven soviet mailmen
speculation as to the nature of aliens will no doubt continue until we wake up one morning to find n they taken over the <unk> <unk> the way n they overwhelm an entire town in <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> snatchers <unk> <unk> <unk> pages n
maybe some of our talk - show hosts and anchors have already been taken over
the point of this <unk> novel which spawned two movies is that the soulless pod people replicated by alien plants are virtually indistinguishable from human folks
another guy who thinks <unk> they out there and closing fast is <unk> <unk> whose new novel <unk> <unk> <unk> pages <unk> takes a look at a reported <unk> <unk> crash near the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> desert
<unk> <unk> knows a lot about aliens
he even had sex with one sort of and not intentionally as readers learned in his <unk> a book recently described in the <unk> <unk> <unk> as a nonfiction best seller
the way <unk> <unk> <unk> tells it in his earnest prose the intelligence officer who found the craft strange debris was forced by the government to call the flower - inscribed scraps parts of a weather balloon
the apparent crash became top secret and the alien creatures went away upset with the rude ways of human beings
we lost our chance to communicate with sweet - natured visitors about four feet tall who looked as though they were made of puffed - up marshmallow
<unk> <unk> is an editorial writer for the <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> will become <unk> <unk> <unk> when its merger is completed with <unk> <unk> of <unk> the bank said <unk>
<unk> <unk> which is also a bank agreed in <unk> to buy <unk> for n million shares of stock with a market value of about n million
the transaction is expected to close around year end
when the economy stumbled in the <unk> <unk> <unk> fell out of bed
towering overcapacity in the synthetic fiber business which accounted for half of the dutch chemical company sales led to huge losses and left <unk> survival in doubt
it was n't until the early n that <unk> nursed itself back to health
now as a new downturn in the chemical industry looms <unk> says n it is in far better shape n to cope
investment analysts generally agree
aside from slashing costs and investing heavily in its plants <unk> has spent n billion guilders n billion on acquisitions since <unk> to give it better balance
during the same period the company has sold about n billion guilders of assets
the fibers business whose products go into textiles carpeting and myriad industrial uses now accounts for only n of <unk> sales
we have definitely become less cyclical <unk> <unk> executive vice president - finance said in an interview
still <unk> has n't yet found a way n to achieve another goal a large presence in the <unk> market for prescription drugs
<unk> <unk> said <unk> prices for <unk> pharmaceutical companies remain too high making it unlikely that <unk> will pursue any major acquisitions in that area
but he said <unk> <unk> is considering alliances with american drug companies although he would n't elaborate
an indication of <unk> success in reshaping itself will come <unk> when it reports third - quarter results
analysts expect the company to show profit of about n million guilders up n from n million guilders a year earlier
a bigger test will come next year if as many analysts expect bulk chemical prices slump in <unk>
maybe <unk> can surprise the investment world a bit said <unk> <unk> an analyst at <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk>
he figures <unk> <unk> is likely to be one of the few major chemical companies <unk> to show profit growth next year
the bank projects n <unk> will show per - share earnings of n guilders in <unk> up from an estimated n guilders for this year and the <unk> guilders reported for <unk>
at <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> analyst <unk> <unk> notes that <unk> is less exposed than many of its rivals to the most volatile chemical products
for example <unk> has only minor petrochemical operations is small in plastics and does n't make fertilizers
thus while <unk> profited less than many rivals from the boom of recent years in petrochemicals and plastics it has less n to fear from the current slump
the company is exposed to bulk chemicals however
although bulk - chemical prices have begun falling in the <unk> they are generally stable in <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk>
a decline may come in the first half of n he said n but the market does n't appear on the verge of a severe downturn
to reduce the danger of such pricing cycles <unk> has invested heavily in specialty chemicals which have highly specific industrial uses and tend to produce much higher profit margins than do bulk chemicals
<unk> biggest move in this area was the <unk> acquisition of <unk> <unk> <unk> specialty chemical business for n million
in a less glamorous field <unk> is the world biggest producer of industrial salt used as a raw material for the chemical industry as well as for such tasks as melting ice
<unk> also makes products derived from salt such as chlorine and caustic soda
in the fibers division profit remains weak largely because of persistent overcapacity
but <unk> is still slimming down it recently announced plans to eliminate about <unk> fiber - related jobs in the <unk> and <unk> <unk>
although the polyester and rayon markets remain mostly bleak <unk> has high hopes for some emerging fiber businesses such carbon fibers and aramid extremely strong fibers used to reinforce tires and metals and to make such products as bullet - proof vests
<unk> <unk> aramid fiber is a distant second to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which dominates the market
<unk> <unk> said n world - wide industry sales of aramid fibers are expected to total about n million this year
sales growth of <unk> a year seems possible he said <unk> and <unk> expects its <unk> business to become profitable in <unk>
<unk> also has spent heavily on acquisitions in paints auto finishes and industrial coatings
in <unk> for example it completed the n million acquisition of <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> maker of industrial coatings for wood metals and plastics from <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> is likely to see strong profit growth from coatings as it realizes cost savings and other benefits from its greater scale
for <unk> drug business where profits have shown litle change for the past five years <unk> <unk> predicted moderate profit growth
<unk> is the leading seller of birth - control pills in <unk> but is still seeking regulatory approvals to enter that market in the <unk> and <unk>
<unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> hopes to have approval to sell its <unk> pill in the <unk> in <unk>
<unk> also has small operations in diagnostic tests generic drugs and veterinary products
veterinary products are showing especially strong growth <unk> <unk> said <unk>
among the leading products is a flu shot for horses
we sorry to see <unk> <unk> departure from the british government
he is a politician with the courage of true conviction as in summarily sacking exchange controls and in particular slashing the top rate of income taxation to <unk>
but in the end his resignation as <unk> of the <unk> may be a good thing especially if it works as he no doubt intends by forcing <unk> <unk> <unk> and her counterparts elsewhere to confront the genuine intellectual issues involved
the early omens we admit <unk> scarcely suggest so wholesome an outcome
the <unk> <unk> reaction was captured in the <unk> headline <unk> reveals <unk> poison
british politicians divide into two groups of chickens those with their necks cut and those screaming <unk> the sky is falling
so far as we can see only two persons are behaving with a dignity recognizing the seriousness of the issues <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> the counterpoint of the <unk> difficulties who also resigned as personal adviser to <unk> <unk>
the problem is that on the vital issue of monetary policy and exchange rates conservative free - market economists divide into at least three incompatible camps
there are the strict monetarists who believe that floating exchange rates free an economy to stabilize its price level by stabilizing the monetary aggregates
there are the supply - side globalists who seek to spread the advantages of a common currency through fixed exchange rates
and there are the twin - deficit keynesians who predict\/advocate devaluations n to balance trade flows
this is a problem not only for <unk> <unk> <unk> but for <unk> <unk> as shown in the ongoing bickering over the dollar between the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk>
in the british case <unk> <unk> is the closest thing in <unk> to a supply - side globalist
he not only slashed marginal tax rates initially sparking fresh growth in <unk> but he wanted to regulate monetary policy by targeting exchange rates indeed joining the <unk> <unk> <unk>
while no doubt agreeing with <unk> <unk> on everything else <unk> <unk> is a dyed - in-the-wool monetarist inclined to defend floating rates to the death
to make matters even more confusing the earlier <unk> experience made clear that <unk> <unk> tax cuts would have profound effects on <unk> international accounts and the value of sterling
they increased the after - tax rate of return and made <unk> a far more attractive place <unk> to invest producing sudden capital inflows
by accounting definitions this had to produce a sudden trade deficit
as in the <unk> it also produced a sudden burst in the demand for sterling that is a surge in the sterling monetary aggregates <unk> - <unk>
at this point the options were <unk> money to stop the boost in the aggregates as <unk> <unk> surely advised and forget the soaring pound
to push the pound even lower trying to cure the trade deficit a policy n <unk> has repeatedly proved disastrous
or to supply enough money n to meet the increased demand and stabilize the exchange rate as the <unk> argued and ensure the permanence of this policy by joining the <unk>
faced with a similar situation <unk> <unk> let the dollar soar though monetary aggregates also grew so rapidly n monetarists issued egg - on-the-face warnings of inflation
but this devastated the <unk> manufacturing sector laying the seeds of protectionism
<unk> <unk> though not allowed to join the <unk> chose to shadow the deutsche mark
he reaped inflation along with rapid growth no doubt validating <unk> <unk> predictions in the <unk> <unk> mind
but more recently the pound has been falling with high inflation which has also seemed almost impervious to the high interest rates n <unk> <unk> deployed to stop it
so the british experience presents a genuine puzzle that reaches far beyond the shores of <unk>
we had been soliciting opinions on it long before <unk> <unk> resignation and offer some of the collection for the benefit of his successor and one - time deputy <unk> <unk>
to begin with we should note that in contrast to the <unk> deficit <unk> has been running largish budget surpluses
in pursuit of this mystery keynesian adepts and twin - deficit mavens need not apply
we should also add <unk> <unk> own explanation as we understand it
unlike the <unk> <unk> never achieved even a momentary reduction in real wages
the wage stickiness which <unk> studies confirm n is particularly high in <unk> gives its economy a structural bias toward inflation
inflation is easier n to spark and harder <unk> to control
we should also concede that in the british experience the monetarist cause regains some of the credibility n it lost in the <unk> experience
nearby <unk> <unk> <unk> a distinguished supply - sider with monetarist sympathies argues the case for <unk> <unk>
perhaps the fiscal shock of tax cuts is after all best absorbed by floating rates though of course in the event <unk> <unk> resigned over whether to support a weak pound not restrain a strong one
we recall that <unk> <unk> not only chides the <unk> for being too easy because of a desire to constrain sterling but also led the chorus saying that <unk> <unk> was too tight when he let the dollar rise
somewhere in between there must be a golden mean perhaps measured by <unk> - <unk> but perhaps measured by purchasing power parity
the globalists tend to think <unk> <unk> <unk> ran onto technical reefs
in fixing rates the choice of initial parities is crucial for example and perhaps he picked the wrong pound - dm rate
for that matter perhaps he fixed to the wrong currency
we sympathize with <unk> <unk> reluctance to tie her currency to one governed by the domestic political imperatives of <unk> <unk>
perhaps the shock would have been less if they fixed to another low - tax deregulated supply - side economy
<unk> <unk> of <unk> adds his suspicion that the unrecognized inflationary culprit is the budget surplus
those who can shake keynesian ghosts out of their heads might recognize that the retirement of gilts for cash is equivalent to an expansionary open - market operation indeed it is the definition of an open market operation to expand the money supply
<unk> <unk> also notes that since british banks have no reserve requirements high interest rates are less likely to curb inflation than to cause recession
we would add that in political terms <unk> <unk> problem was failing to decide between the <unk> and her adviser
in the end neither policy was followed and instead of learning anything we are left with a mystery
in particular shadowing a currency is anything but fixing it is an open announcement that the exchange rate target has no credibility
all the more so when strong voices are heard opposing the policy
better to have a true monetarist policy just for the experience
so <unk> <unk> had to resign
in the end his move was sparked by remarks in excerpts from <unk> <unk> autobiography in the <unk> <unk> a n academic journal
but it was the underlying situation that became intolerable
what <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> will do now remains to be seen
they confront stubborn inflation and a sagging economy that is to say stagflation
this can not be solved by provoking a further downturn reducing the supply of goods does not solve inflation
our advice is this immediately return the government surpluses to the economy through incentive - maximizing tax cuts and find some monetary policy target that balances both supply and demand for money which neither aggregates nor interest rates can do
this was the version of supply - side economics that in the late <unk> and early n worked in <unk> and world - wide to solve a far more serious stagflation than afflicts <unk> today
<unk> <unk> whose declining profitability prompted its takeover by <unk> <unk> earlier this year will see its profit margins bounce back to the n range in <unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> the agency new chairman - elect
the ad agency pretax profit margins were slightly under n at the time of the takeover according to analysts <unk> - based <unk> goal is to increase margins to <unk>
<unk> <unk> made his comments during an interview detailing his plans for the agency
british - born the <unk> <unk> veteran was named last week to succeed <unk> <unk> who is leaving by year end to take a top post at <unk> <unk> an <unk> client
surrounded by stacks of paper two computers and photos of himself boating and flying <unk> <unk> laid out several changes n he hopes to make at the agency
first and foremost <unk> <unk> said <unk> he hopes to improve client service
<unk> under the fastidious <unk> <unk> gained a reputation as occasionally being high - handed in its treatment of clients of preaching what strategy a client should indeed must follow
and some of its top client - service executives including <unk> <unk> were promoted to the point n they were saddled with administrative duties with little time n to see clients
but <unk> <unk> recently freed himself up to spend more time with clients by delegating much of his administrative work to a deputy
he also plans to get to know clients that <unk> <unk> was closer to such as <unk> brothers <unk> <unk> and <unk>
the two men are planning joint visits to a number of clients to attempt to smoothly hand over the reins
clients want to see more of our senior people involved in the business not once a month but two or three times a week he said
<unk> <unk> also hopes to finally implement a reorganization announced earlier this year but put on hold by the <unk> takeover
the reorganization is supposed to make one - stop shopping buying advertising public relations and design all in one place or <unk> <unk> in <unk> a reality
under the reorganization <unk> plans to name one executive on each account as a client service director n to work as the client single contact for all those services
there is little or no integration of our work quality is spotty there is no single focus <unk> <unk> complained to staffers in <unk> when the reorganization was announced
now <unk> <unk> says <unk> he hopes to have the new system in place for several clients including <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> by year end
industry executives and analysts are divided on whether <unk> <unk> is up to the task
he is n't as well - known to clients as is <unk> <unk>
under his watch office politicking was often rampant in the agency <unk> <unk> operation and the office there has had a dismal new - business record for more than a year
and while last week the agency hired a top <unk> executive <unk> <unk> <unk> to try to bolster its work <unk> has to get the revenue of that <unk> <unk> office moving says <unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk> securities
the one thing <unk> <unk> <unk> clearly does have going for him is continuity although it is n't certain if that will be enough
as <unk> <unk> says the last thing n they need is enormous disruption at the top and <unk> is obviously a long - term member of the <unk> <unk> <unk> as we call it
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> are indeed quite similar in substance if not in style
while <unk> <unk> is a workaholic detailsman <unk> <unk> would rather delegate leaving him time for his interests outside the office
<unk> <unk> by contrast seems rarely to cut loose at all although he did appear at <unk> <unk> party <unk> decked out in duck feet and a duck hat costumed as a lame duck
<unk> <unk> said <unk> the company expected margin improvement will be all but inevitable given that the company profitability was dragged down this year by an expensive move to luxurious oversized new <unk> <unk> headquarters
the move budgeted at about n million actually came in at about n million he said n
but margins will be helped too by some other cost - saving steps
<unk> eliminated the mail room staff closed the executive dining room and after the takeover let go half a dozen financial executives
<unk> which assumes financial control of its businesses in a hands - on way instituted a new financial system and plans to sublet some floors in <unk> new headquarters building to outsiders
the fact that the agency will now be part of a <unk> company under british accounting rules will also make the profit picture look better
<unk> <unk> steps
<unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> office stepped down temporarily in the wake of charges by a federal grand jury in <unk> <unk> <unk> that he the agency and another top executive bribed jamaican tourist officials to win its account in <unk>
in an internal memo <unk> <unk> the agency chairman said <unk> <unk> <unk> decided to remove himself to minimize negative reaction from prospective clients and others and to prepare for his defense
the fact that he is in the process of defending himself against the present charges could conceivably have an adverse impact on <unk> <unk> <unk> wrote
he said <unk> <unk> <unk> will return to his post at the end of the trial at which he will be vindicated
<unk> <unk> will work with <unk> <unk> on some of the agency joint venture activities and acquisitions while the case is pending
<unk> <unk> president of <unk> ad operations will assume <unk> <unk> day - to-day role
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> named <unk> <unk> as an executive vice president and creative partner in its image group which concentrates on fashion and visually oriented advertising
<unk> <unk> <unk> had headed up <unk> agency heller\/breene a unit of <unk>
the agency with about n million in billings will be dissolved with some of its staffers absorbed by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> unit in <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk>
she said n it was too early to say what would happen to its clients including <unk> and <unk>
at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> will concentrate on accounts that include <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> cigarette brand which relies on print ads <unk> <unk> specialty
as previously reported the account is troubled with <unk> <unk> asking <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and possibly others to try their hand at developing new creative work
<unk> <unk> declined to comment on the status of the account as did the other agencies
<unk> industries <unk> said <unk> holders of <unk> face amount of its <unk> <unk> convertible subordinated debentures due <unk> n <unk> have elected to convert the debt into about n common shares
the conversion price is <unk> a share
the company said <unk> the holders represent n of the face amount of the debentures
<unk> sells a variety of hardware products for the home repair market
<unk> <unk> <unk> the closely held department store chain said in a financial filing <unk> that its sales for the fiscal fourth quarter ended <unk> <unk> were up <unk> to n billion against <unk> billion a year earlier
comparable store sales for the quarter were up n
the net loss for the quarter was n million against a year - earlier loss of n million
the loss in the fourth quarter of <unk> reflected in part expenses for an unsuccessful bid for <unk> <unk> stores <unk> as well as the restructuring of some of its department store operations
for the year sales were up <unk> to n billion compared with n billion in fiscal <unk>
sales for both years reflect <unk> performances for each year of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> acquired those three businesses in <unk> <unk>
on a comparable store basis including the new acquisitions for both years sales for fiscal <unk> were up n
<unk> reported a net loss for fiscal <unk> of n million compared with a net loss of n million for fiscal <unk>
the company earnings before interest taxes and depreciation which bondholders use a measurement of the chain ability to pay its existing debt increased n in fiscal <unk> to n million from n million
the n million figures includes the new acquisitions
excluding those businesses earnings before interest taxes and depreciation for <unk> would have been n million
as of <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> stores will operate as <unk> <unk> stores
altogether <unk> and its subsidiaries own or lease <unk> department stores and <unk> specialty stores nationwide
although management led a leveraged buy - out of <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> the company still makes financial filings because of its publicly traded debt
the company estimates its total debt at about n billion
this includes n billion of long - term debt n million in short - term debt and n million of the current portion of long - term debt
in a letter to investors <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> wrote that he expects the company to benefit from some of the disruption faced by our competitors
while our competitors are concerned with their financial viability and possible ownership changes we will be concentrating on buying and selling merchandise n our customers need and want
<unk> <unk> is apparently referring to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> two <unk> <unk> retailers that have recently filed for chapter n bankruptcy protection as well as the retail chains owned by financially troubled <unk> <unk>
those chains include <unk> which <unk> recently said <unk> it will sell
other retail properties for sale include <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> retailers now owned by <unk> <unk> the british tobacco conglomerate
in his letter <unk> <unk> also referred to the recent <unk> <unk> earthquake
<unk> <unk> flew to <unk> <unk> the day after the earthquake and found that <unk> to n of his company stores had sustained some damage including the breakage of most windows at the <unk> <unk> store on <unk> <unk>
the volume and profit impact on our fiscal first quarter will not be positive but looking at the whole fiscal year we do n't see the effect as material wrote <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> it agreed to sell its <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> candy businesses to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> unit for n million
the sale at a higher price than some analysts had expected helps the food and tobacco giant raise funds <unk> to pay debt and boosts <unk> <unk> share of the <unk> candy market to about <unk>
the candy businesses had sales of about n million last year which was roughly <unk> of total revenue for <unk> <unk> <unk> unit according to a memorandum distributed by <unk> owner <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to bankers last <unk>
the <unk> acquisition includes a candy plant in <unk> <unk> <unk> which employs about n workers
the sale which had been expected is part of <unk> program <unk> to pay down n billion of a n billion bridge loan by <unk>
roughly n billion of that debt has already been repaid from previous asset sales and <unk> expects to use another <unk> billion from the pending two - part sale of most of its <unk> <unk> unit
that sale however could still fall through if financing problems develop
thus it remains crucial for <unk> to obtain top dollar for its smaller assets like the candy brands
<unk> <unk> <unk> chairman and chief executive officer of <unk> <unk> - based <unk> called the sale a significant step in the company divestiture program as well as a a strategic divestiture
since <unk> bought <unk> in <unk> for n billion of debt it has agreed to sell nearly n billion of <unk> assets
<unk> executives have said n they will dispense with certain brands in particular that are n't leaders in their markets
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> will concentrate more on our own core businesses <unk> <unk> said <unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk> are both among the top - selling <unk> chocolate bars in the <unk> but <unk> overall share of the roughly n billion market is less than n
<unk> share of n before <unk> purchases is far below the shares of market leaders <unk> foods <unk> and <unk> <unk> which have about <unk> and <unk> of the market respectively
this means <unk> <unk> is now in the candybar business in a big way said <unk> <unk> publisher of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
for them it makes all kinds of sense
they been given a mandate from <unk> to expand their <unk> chocolate operations
<unk> <unk> is based in <unk> <unk>
the new candy bars make an important contribution to our <unk> <unk> commitment to this very important strategic unit said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> third - quarter net income fell <unk> to n million or <unk> a share reflecting the damages from <unk> <unk> and lower results for some of the company major divisions
catastrophe losses reduced <unk> net income by n million including n million from <unk>
last year catastrophe losses totaled n million when net was n million or <unk> a share
the year - earlier results have been restated to reflect an accounting change
the insurer has started processing claims from the <unk> <unk> earthquake nearly two weeks ago
but because these claims are more difficult to evaluate and have been coming in more slowly the company has no estimate of the impact of the earthquake on fourth - quarter results
in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> composite trading <unk> <unk> closed at <unk> down n cents
in the latest quarter <unk> had a n million loss on its auto\/homeowners line compared with earnings of n million last year
profit for its commercial insurance division fell <unk> to n million reflecting higher catastrophe losses and the price war in the property\/casualty market for nearly three years
however <unk> employee benefits division which includes its group health insurance operations posted a n profit gain to n million
third - quarter results included net realized capital gains of n million which included n million from the sale of <unk> investors in <unk> and a n million tax credit
in the nine months net rose n to n million or <unk> a share from n million or <unk> a share last year
out of the mouths of revolutionaries are coming words of moderation
here at a soccer stadium near the black township of <unk> yesterday were eight leaders of the <unk> <unk> <unk> seven of whom had spent most of their adult lives in prison for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government
here were more than <unk> <unk> supporters gathering for the first <unk> rally inside <unk> <unk> since the black liberation movement was banned in <unk>
here was the state security appartus poised to pounce on any words or acts of provocation let alone revolution
but the words that boomed over the loudspeakers bore messages of peace unity negotiation and discipline
we stand for peace today and we will stand for peace tomorrow said <unk> <unk> the <unk> former secretary general who along with five of his colleagues served n years in prison before being released two weeks ago
some members of the huge crowd shouted <unk> peace viva
these are curious times in south african politics
the government and the <unk> the bitterest of enemies are engaged in an elaborate mating dance designed to entice each other to the negotiating table
<unk> releases the <unk> leaders most of whom were serving life sentences and allows them to speak freely hoping that the <unk> will abandon its use of violence
the <unk> leaders speak in tones of moderation emphasizing discipline hoping n the government will be encouraged to take further steps such as freeing <unk> <unk> the most prominent <unk> figure and unbanning the organization
the government of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is using this situation to improve its international image and head off further economic sanctions
meanwhile the many organizations inside the country that back the <unk> are taking the opportunity to regain their strength and mobilize their supporters even though the state of emergency which has severely curtailed black opposition remains in force
the result is that the unthinkable and illogical are happening
six months ago government approval for an <unk> rally was inconceivable
equally inconceivable is that the <unk> given the chance to hold a rally would extend a hand albeit warily to the government
in a message read out at the rally exiled <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who ca n't legally be quoted in <unk> <unk> said <unk> the country was at a crossroads and that <unk> <unk> <unk> may yet earn a place among the peacemakers of our country if he chooses a path of genuine political settlement
still this does n't mean that either the government or the <unk> is changing stripes or that either has moved significantly closer to the other
the government may ease repression in some areas but it still keeps a tight grip in others
for instance it releases <unk> <unk> without conditions yet his son <unk> a newspaper editor is restricted to his home much of the day and is n't allowed to work as a journalist
the <unk> vows to keep up pressure on the government
speakers yesterday called on foreign governments to increase sanctions against <unk> and urged supporters inside the country to continue defying emergency restrictions and racial segregation known as apartheid
we can not wait on the government to make changes at its own pace <unk> <unk> said
because the <unk> remains banned both the government which approved the rally and the organizers who orchestrated it denied n it was an <unk> rally
they both called it a welcome home gathering
nevertheless an <unk> rally by any other name is still an <unk> rally
the recently released leaders sat high atop a podium in one section of the stadium stands
behind them was a huge <unk> flag and an even bigger sign that said <unk> lives <unk> leads
next to them was the red flag of the outlawed <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which has long been an <unk> ally
in the stands people waved <unk> flags wore <unk> t - shirts sang <unk> songs and chanted <unk> slogans
today said <unk> <unk> the <unk> has captured the center stage of political life in <unk> <unk>
as a police helicopter circled overhead <unk> <unk> repeated the <unk> demands on the government to create a climate for negotiations <unk> all political prisoners unconditionally lift all bans and restrictions on individuals and organizations remove all troops from the black townships end the state of emergency and cease all political trials and political executions
if these conditions are met he said n the <unk> would be prepared to discuss suspending its guerrilla activities
there can be no question of us unilaterally abandoning the armed struggle he said
to date we see no clear indication that the government is serious about negotiations
all their utterances are vague
echoing a phrase from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said let all of us who love this country engage in the task of building a new <unk> <unk>
when <unk> <unk> <unk> shuttered its massive steam turbine plant in <unk> <unk> three years ago it seemed like the company had pulled the plug on its century - old power generation business
but now <unk> is enjoying a resurgence in demand for both steam and combustion turbines and may even join the growing legion of independent electric producers
and with its new venture with <unk> <unk> <unk> industries <unk> announced last week it is poised to penetrate growing markets overseas
for the first time since the <unk> <unk> this year has seen a significant increase in orders for power plants
most are from independent producers instead of regulated utilities and <unk> believes n it will ride a wave of demand stretching over the next six years
analysts agree predicting that the revived market could significantly boost <unk> bottom line in coming years
<unk> earnings could be materially enhanced in the <unk> or sooner says <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>
the company expects a need for <unk> megawatts of new generation in the <unk> over the next decade
already this year it has received orders for four <unk> advanced combustion turbines from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and for two n plants from <unk> <unk> <unk> among others
<unk> own role as a supplier also is changing
in the past the company usually took token equity positions in power plants n it supplied as a kicker to close deals
but last <unk> annnouncement that <unk> would put up all of the <unk> million <unk> to build a new n plant could herald a new age
<unk> plant will provide electrical power to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and backup power and steam to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
we have n't decided on a strategy yet but we could become an independent producer depending on whether we the developer or just the supplier says <unk> <unk> executive vice president of the company energy and utility systems group
at the same time <unk> hopes <unk> its venture with <unk> will help fend off growing competition particularly in the <unk> from such european competitors as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
under the agreement <unk> will be able to purchase smaller combustion turbines from its japanese partner and package and sell them with its own generators and other equipment
<unk> also jointly will bid on projects with <unk> giving it an edge in developing asian markets
in addition the two companies will develop new steam turbine technology such as the plants ordered by <unk> <unk> and even utilize each other plants at times to take advantage of currency fluctuations
even though we still compete against <unk> we can also work jointly on some projects and we gain a lot of sourcing flexibility <unk> <unk> contends
the <unk> - <unk> venture was designed as a non - equity transaction circumventing any possible antitrust concerns
<unk> carefully crafted the agreement because the <unk> <unk> earlier this year successfully challenged a proposed steam turbine joint venture with <unk> <unk> <unk>
it is expected that the current surge in demand for new power will be filled primarily by independent producers which unlike utilities are n't regulated and therefore do n't need government approval to construct new plants
<unk> expects about half of its new orders for turbines to come from independent producers for at least the next six years
despite shutdowns of the company <unk> and <unk> <unk> plants the company believes n it has sufficient capacity <unk> to meet near - term demand with its much smaller and more efficient manufacturing facilities in <unk> <unk>
still <unk> acknowledges that demand from independent producers could evaporate if prices for fuel such as natural gas or oil rise sharply or if utilities which have been pressured by regulators to keep down rates are suddenly freed to add significant generating capacity
even if that scenario occurs <unk> figures n it is prepared
the company already is gearing up for a renaissance of nuclear power even though it has n't received an order for a domestic nuclear plant in a decade
<unk> <unk> <unk> chairman and chief executive officer says <unk> he expects a commercial order by <unk> for the company n nuclear power plant which is under development
once we see an order we expect <unk> it be on line by n
among the things n i learned covering the <unk> <unk> these past few weeks is that the <unk> scale which measures earthquakes is n't like the one in your bathroom
a quake that measures two on the <unk> is n't twice as severe as a one it n times worse
a three is n times n again and so on
that put the seven of <unk> n in perspective for me
think n i buy one of those i survived t - shirts after all
by richterian standards the show that the <unk> <unk> put on <unk> and <unk> nights in putting a mercifully swift end to the game <unk> <unk> <unk> rated somewhere between a <unk> and an n
the boys with the white elephants on their sleeves might not have made the earth move much but they certainly did some impressive things with baseballs
the <unk> pachyderms propelled six of out of the unfriendly confines of <unk> <unk> during the two games en route to <unk> and <unk> wins over the <unk> <unk> giants
combined with their two pre - quake victories way back on <unk> <unk> and n the scores were <unk> and <unk> remember that gave them a sweep of the best - of-seven series
the joke here is that the giants lost by de fault
that geologically correct but a trifle unfair otherwise
they showed up but did n't or could n't challenge
they led for nary an inning in the four games and managed to stir their fans only once
that came in the seventh inning of <unk> <unk> when trailing <unk> they scored four times and brought their big heat will <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the plate with one out and a runner on
but <unk> flied out to short right field and <unk> drive to left was caught on the warning track by <unk> <unk> as <unk> sets of lungs exhaled as one
i went out to <unk> <unk> the <unk> reliever and told him that we were n't gon na let this guy beat us said <unk> catcher <unk> <unk> of the decisive confrontation with <unk> the <unk> <unk> reigning home - run king
i told him to make <unk> reach for everything and that what we did
the ball <unk> he hit was n't a strike
if it had been he mighta hit it out
but if the <unk> had n't won in four they would have prevailed in five or six or seven
the best team won this series which is more unusual than it may sound
<unk> ai n't football where the good teams beat up on the bad ones
the best baseball teams win six of n games and the worst win four of n
without becoming overly contentious allow me to suggest that several recent champions of the world according to us as in <unk> might not have ranked no . n in many polls
that list includes last season champs the <unk> <unk> dodgers who rode a miracle home run by <unk> <unk> and two faultless pitching performances by <unk> <unk> to a five - game triumph over a bewitched bothered <unk> crew
these a however got few grades as low as b on their n report card
they led the <unk> leagues in regular - season wins with <unk> and flattened the <unk> <unk> jays four games to one for the <unk> <unk> pennant before stomping their cross - bay rivals
the pithiest testimony to their domination of the just - concluded tournament came from giants manager <unk> <unk> after his team had fallen in <unk> <unk> to a five - home-run barrage that tied a <unk> <unk> record
asked what he would do differently on the morrow <unk> allowed that he might play his outfielders deeper maybe on the other side of the fence
the a offensive showing in the <unk> got an a as in awesome
their n total bases broke a record for a four - game set and their nine home runs tied one
eight <unk> players hit homers with centerfielder <unk> <unk> getting two both on <unk>
<unk> <unk> the do - everything leadoff man had nine hits and set or tied four - game <unk> marks for triples <unk> and stolen bases n
the sole <unk> <unk> not to homer was cleanup hitter <unk> <unk> their regular - season leader with n and he contributed five hits plus a diving fielding play on a ground ball in <unk> <unk> that stopped a <unk> rally while the issue still was in doubt
think n i redo my image get this changed to a glove quipped the big first baseman <unk> night fingering the gold bat n he wears on a neck chain
even with that power show though the <unk> <unk> star certified by the <unk> <unk> <unk> award was a pitcher <unk> <unk>
he shut out the giants on five hits in <unk> <unk> and allowed three runs on five hits in seven innings <unk> after the <unk> break caused by the earthquake
<unk> honor was a nice note on a couple of grounds
one was that despite his <unk> regular - season wins over the past three seasons in the <unk> beyond the <unk> <unk> he has been overshadowed by his more - muscular mates and missed out on prizes that might have been his due
the other is that he an <unk> native and lifted residents spirits by his visits to quake - hit areas last week
afterward as the <unk> toasted their victory with beer they dispensed with traditional champagne showers in deference to the quake victims <unk> said <unk> he thought <unk> his championship - team ring would outshine his individual trophy
give me four or five more series with these guys and i do n't care if i ever win a <unk> <unk> he said in reference to baseball best - pitcher award
indeed the possibility of an a ring cycle a\/k\/a a dynasty was a major topic of post - game discussion <unk> so much so that <unk> <unk> the team general manager felt obliged to dampen it
people change teams change he cautioned
it easier to get worse than better in this game
he might have added an interesting historical fact the last series sweep by the <unk> reds came in <unk> which also was the first year of baseball player free agency
it was widely predicted that free agency would allow the glamorous big market teams to monopolize the best talent but quite the opposite has occurred twelve different clubs have won titles in the n seasons since its advent
the number includes such unstylish burgs as well <unk>
the rationale for responding to your customers needs faster than the competition can is clear your company will benefit in terms of market share customer satisfaction and profitability
in fact managers today are probably more aware of speed as a competitive variable than ever before
however for many managing speed does not come naturally
most of us grew up believing in the axioms <unk> makes waste and do n't cut corners ideas that seem to run counter to the concept of managing speed says <unk> <unk> vice president for product integrity at <unk> <unk>
but in the real world you learn that speed and quality are not a trade - off
speed is a component of quality one of the things n we must deliver to satisfy customers
companies that actually market speed as part of their service train their managers to lead and participate in teams that increase speed and improve quality in everyday operations
managers learn to spot opportunities to increase customer satisfaction through speed and shift some responsibility for analyzing improving and streamlining work processes from themselves to teams of employees
one team at the <unk> <unk> <unk> operations station in <unk> <unk> focused on a particularly time - sensitive operation the morning package sort
every morning tractor - trailer trucks arrive at the <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk> carrying the day package load
in peak periods that load may include <unk> pieces
the packages must be sorted quickly and distributed to smaller vans for delivery so couriers can be on the road by n
no customer is present at the morning package sort but the process is nevertheless critical to customer satisfaction
we committed to deliver the customer package by a stated time usually n notes <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> courier who led the <unk> team
the sooner our vans hit the road each morning the easier it is for us to fulfill that obligation
following a problem - solving formula used by teams throughout <unk> <unk> members of the <unk> team monitored their morning routine carefully noting where and when the work group resources were used effectively and where they were idle waiting for others upstream in the process to send packages their way
we suspected n there was downtime built into our process
but we did n't know just where it was until we completed our data gathering <unk> <unk> says
we used the data to redesign our sorting system and put our resources where they could do the most good
the team even created a points system <unk> to identify those couriers and subgroups that were doing the most n to reduce package - sort cycle time
winners of the friendly competition earn a steak dinner out with their spouses
monitoring shows that the <unk> team new system really does reduce cycle time for the morning package sort reports <unk> <unk> chief operating officer at <unk> <unk>
the vans leave at least n minutes earlier on average than they used to
and service levels have increased to the point where they consistently above n
a cross - functional team at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> facility which produces air - separation plants followed a similar path to reduce manufacturing cycle time
the team included craftsmen from the shop floor as well as engineering scheduling and purchasing personnel reports <unk> <unk> director of quality
first they produced a flowchart detailing the process by which an air - separation plant actually gets built
then they identified snags in the process
the <unk> team determined that holdups for inspections were the main problem and identified which kinds of delays involved critical inspections and which were less critical or could be handled by workers already on the line
the team then proposed modifications in their work process to management
the streamlined manufacturing process benefits our customers in at least two ways <unk> <unk> concludes
first we have better quality assurance than ever because the people building the product have taken on more responsibility for the quality of their own work
second we trimmed more than a month off the time required to deliver a finished product
at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a cross - functional team reduced the cycle time required to produce a new business proposal for an important government contract
the team was composed of representatives from engineering manufacturing corporate estimating flight test material quality control and other departments
we needed contributions from all these departments to generate the proposal says <unk> <unk> configuration - data manager for <unk> <unk> combat aircraft program
but instead of gathering their input piecemeal we formed the team which reached consensus on the proposal objectives and produced a statement of work n to guide all the functions that were involved
armed with this shared understanding and requisite background information each department developed its specialized contribution to the proposal submitting data and cost estimates on a closely managed schedule
we cleared up questions and inconsistencies very quickly because the people who had the skills and perspective required to resolve them were part of the task team <unk> <unk> explains
the team trimmed more than two months from the cycle time previously required to develop comparable proposals
the team eliminated the crisis mentality that proposal deadlines can generate
the result was a more thoughtful complete and competitive proposal <unk> <unk> concludes
the successes achieved at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> suggest that managing speed may be an underutilized source of competitive advantage
managers in all three companies recognize speed as a component of quality and a key to customer satisfaction
they effectively lead team efforts to reduce cycle time
and they prepare all their people to increase the speed and improve the quality of their own work
<unk> <unk> is president of <unk> a consulting firm in <unk> <unk>
home taping of pre - recorded music cuts into record industry revenues but banning home taping would hurt consumers even more
that the conclusion of an independent report prepared by the <unk> of <unk> <unk> at the request of the <unk> and <unk> judiciary committees
the report is to be released today
the report says <unk> the availability of such advanced analog recording equipment as cassette recorders does n't seem to increase the quantity of home copying
that finding the report says n casts doubt on the record industry contention that the new generation of digital recording equipment will inevitably lead to wholesale abuse of copyrighted material by home tapers
the longstanding position of the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> a trade group based in <unk> <unk> is that record companies performers songwriters and music publishers need to be remunerated by government - imposed fees on the sale of blank tapes and recording equipment to make up for royalties lost to home taping
i think n it is a nail in the coffin in any royalty tax proposal says <unk> <unk> vice president for government and legal affairs of the <unk> industries <unk> in <unk>
what the report shows is everything n we been saying for the past eight or nine years that audio taping is the best thing n to happen for the recording industry
the people who tape the most buy the most
<unk> <unk> a spokesperson for <unk> says <unk> her organization has n't received a copy of the completed report yet and has no immediate comment
a recent agreement between the recording industry and electronics manufacturers requires that any digital audio tape or <unk> recorder sold in the <unk> have a built - in device that restricts its ability to make second copies from <unk> tape copies of digital compact disks
but the disappointing sales of <unk> machines here and abroad so far have not seemed to warrant the three years of legal wrangling that went into the agreement
under current copyright laws it is considered fair use to reproduce copyrighted material for one personal use or for use by one family or friends while copying for purposes of resale or profit is prohibited
a survey contained in the <unk> report copyright and home <unk> <unk> challenges the <unk> found that most people consider home copying for such personal use a right a right moreover that was exercised by <unk> of americans over the age of <unk> in the past year
the study says that the ambiguous legal status of home copying makes it appropriate to examine the effects on consumers as well as on industry
reports by the <unk> of <unk> <unk> do n't prescribe any specific legislative action but suggest a range of options that <unk> may pursue
the study also says that advent of new communications technologies makes an explicit congressional definition of the legal status of home copying more desirable in order to reduce legal and market uncertainties and to prevent de facto changes to copyright law through technology and says that finding an appropriate balance of harms and benefits is a political decision not a technical one
<unk> most famous raider says n he is n't one
<unk> <unk> <unk> believes <unk> fortunes are made by being friendly
and in little more than a decade of being friendly and at the same time rocking the staid swiss business community with some u.s.-style wheeling and dealing the <unk> <unk> <unk> has grown from a modest banker to a billionaire
he achieved this in part with an uncanny talent for getting his foot peacefully in the door of established european companies
his latest coup <unk> masterminding of the five billion swiss - franc n billion merger between <unk> <unk> the world second - largest temporary employment agency and <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> - controlled product - inspection company
shareholders must approve the merger at general meetings of the two companies in late <unk>
but approval is almost certain since <unk> <unk> and a friendly <unk> management are in control

this will be his return on an original investment of between n million swiss francs and n million swiss francs

i like to succeed says <unk> <unk> during a recent morning of working at home which he also likes
home is an estate with green meadows opening onto <unk> <unk> and a low - slung house whose rooms overlook the water and offer a view of the <unk> <unk>
in the corner of his reception room is a delicate antique desk piled high with dossiers
there is a small <unk> on the wall
<unk> - based magazine <unk> lists <unk> <unk> as having a fortune of about n billion swiss francs
writes <unk> no one in <unk> ever came so far so fast
he was simply the first in this country n to realize that treasures were just lying around waiting to be picked up
in short <unk> found companies with weak earnings but rich assets
however the swiss financial press in general as well as many analysts have had a hard time making up their minds about <unk> <unk> and his un - swiss ways
for <unk> most prestigious newspaper <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> seems destined to remain the former <unk> raider an image that has proved hard <unk> to overcome
in <unk> as an upstart in the eyes of <unk> establishment <unk> <unk> laid the foundations of his present - day prominence with an unheard - of raid on <unk> the country traditional shoemaker
sitting beside a banker at a luncheon in <unk> where he was working as a financial consultant he learned that a large packet of <unk> shares was up for sale
looking into <unk> he could hardly believe what he saw a company with enormous real - estate holdings in major european cities and a market capitalization of n million swiss francs it had n employees
investing four million swiss francs earned from his financial transactions and two million swiss francs from his parents and his wife <unk> <unk> acquired <unk> of <unk> shares
but such tactics were alien to <unk> in <unk> and still are n't common because of share restrictions that companies are allowed to maintain
eventually <unk> <unk> was forced to sell his <unk> shares to the weapons maker <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> as establishment pressure grew on this hostile move into the swiss old boys network
<unk> <unk> made n million swiss francs on the sale
<unk> was not an unfriendly takeover he insists
buying from willing shareholders makes an unfriendly takeover impossible <unk> <unk> contends n
i bought from willing shareholders
nevertheless <unk> <unk> has been very careful since then to make sure n his moves are welcome
and he has worked to shed his raider image
in <unk> his career as an industrialist began with the acquisition of the swiss metals works <unk> based in <unk>
with the nonferrous metals business undermined in <unk> by tough foreign competition and high domestic costs this looked like a dull undertaking
but <unk> <unk> brought about a merger in the next few years between the country major producers the increased efficiency has perked up the industry
three years later machinery producer <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was to become part of the <unk> empire
once again the company future looked less than rosy
but after restructuring under new management the profits began rolling in
a major boost to <unk> <unk> respectability among the swiss came in <unk> when he sold n of his <unk> <unk> to the conservative swiss cantonal banks
they renamed it <unk> <unk> and are using it to expand abroad
in <unk> <unk> <unk> bested leading publishing houses to take over <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a major producer of magazines and newspapers
and with the recent acquisition of <unk> of <unk> - based machinery manufacturer <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has enjoyed the status of white knight
<unk> preferred him to financier <unk> <unk> whose secretive raid on the company stock had led to a bitter battle
meanwhile as such strategic investments have mounted the merchant - banking arm of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has been busily buying and selling dozens of companies often after a financial or corporate restructuring
today this branch of <unk> <unk> empire runs under the name <unk> <unk> services and handles mergers and acquisitions placement of securities and real estate
in its portfolio are such diverse companies as <unk> <unk> - based <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> company that makes supermarket checkout machines <unk> <unk> a <unk> manufacturer of securities systems <unk> systems <unk> a <unk> regional telephone company and major real - estate projects in the <unk> and <unk>

the internal transaction within the <unk> empire puzzled <unk> small shareholders but analysts say n it makes sense for <unk> - <unk> to focus on its main businesses of product inspection and temporary help
<unk> <unk> says n the move is yet another example of his conservatism
he explains that companies with real estate give security
the real estate can be used he points out <unk> as guarantees for bank loans for corporate development

the two sides were scheduled to meet with the mediator this morning
machinists already have rejected a package that would provide a <unk> pay raise plus bonuses over the three - year life of the contract
<unk> has said repeatedly <unk> it wo n't expand its offer and the machinists have responded that the offer is n't good enough
however the resolve of some of the striking <unk> machinists might be weakening

it a further step to better returns in the hemorrhaging defense business said <unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
they had to do it
<unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> said n the shift reflects <unk> confidence in <unk> <unk> described by <unk> <unk> as an expert on doing business with the military
his side of the business has been successful in a tough environment <unk> <unk> said
a two - day meeting of representatives of <unk> the <unk> group that oversees exports of sensitive goods to communist countries did n't take any substantive decisions on trimming the list of items under controls
nor did it ease restrictions on exports to <unk> and <unk> according to <unk> officials who attended the talks
the <unk> had been under pressure from several <unk> members especially <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to ease restrictions on some types of machine tools which those countries argued n were now widely available to <unk> <unk> countries from non - <unk> members
for several years some european countries have complained that outdated <unk> lists and restrictions served more to hamper their trade than to add to western security
some countries also have been pressing for special treatment for <unk> and <unk> as they move toward more democratic rule just as special treatment had been agreed on for <unk>
but <unk> officials said n representatives at the meeting decided that this was a matter for further discussion at future meetings
they added that all of us <unk> members look at the changes in <unk> and <unk> in a positive way but a question of this scope deserves further discussion and study
the officials also said n the meeting agreed to continue treating <unk> as a special case despite the recent repression of dissent there but to offer no further concessions
the <unk> officials said that despite the rapid changes under way in <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> all the <unk> members agreed on the continuing need for this organization which was founded n years ago at the start of the <unk> <unk>
the officials said <unk> the meeting agreed to continue working toward streamlining <unk> restricted products list and to improve procedures for punishing companies that do n't comply with the export restrictions
the officials said n this meeting put in motion procedural steps that would speed up both of these functions but that no specific decisions were taken on either matter
<unk> <unk> announcement <unk> of a n million loss for the third quarter showed that the company is moving even faster than expected to take write - offs on its various problems and prepare for a turnaround next year
at the same time the sheer size of the loss coupled with a slowing of orders made some securities analysts wonder just how strong that turnaround will be at the computer maker and defense - electronics concern
<unk> is getting clobbered
just clobbered said <unk> <unk> an analyst at <unk> associates who had once been high on the company
the quarter was terrible and the future looks anything but encouraging
<unk> whose revenue inched up <unk> in the quarter to n billion from n billion in the year - earlier quarter had an operating loss of about n million
on top of that the <unk> <unk> <unk> concern took a n million charge related to the layoffs of <unk> employees
that is at the high end of the range of <unk> to n employees that <unk> said a month ago n would be laid off
<unk> said <unk> that should help it save n million a year in costs again at the high end of the previously reported range of n million to n million
the company also took a write - off of n million to cover losses on some fixed - price defense contracts as some new managers took a hard look at the prospects for that slow - growing business
in addition <unk> set up an unspecified reserve apparently n million to n million to cover the minimum amount n it will have to pay the government because of its involvement in the defense - procurement scandal
<unk> also noted that it paid n million in taxes during the quarter even though tax payments normally would be minimal in a quarter that produced such a big loss
the tax payments will leave <unk> with n million in loss carry - forwards that will cut tax payments in future quarters
in addition <unk> said <unk> it reduced computer inventories a further n million during the quarter leaving it within n million of its goal of a reduction of n million by the end of the year
still <unk> said <unk> its european business was weak during the quarter a worrisome sign given that the company has relied on solid results overseas to overcome weakness in the <unk> over the past several quarters
the company also reported slower growth in another important business systems that use the <unk> operating system
that would be a huge problem if it were to continue because <unk> is betting its business on the assumption that customers want to move away from using operating systems that run on only one manufacturer equipment and toward systems mainly <unk> that work on almost anyone machines
in addition <unk> must deal with its increasingly oppressive debt load
debt has risen to around <unk> billion or about <unk> of total capitalization
that means <unk> <unk> must pay about n million in interest every quarter on top of n million in dividends on preferred stock
<unk> <unk> <unk> president said n he is approaching next year with caution
he said n the strength of the world - wide economy is suspect and does n't see much revenue growth in the cards
he also said that the price wars flaring up in parts of the computer industry will continue through next year
he said n the move toward standard operating systems means n customers are n't locked into buying from their traditional computer supplier and can force prices down
that he said <unk> is why <unk> is overhauling its whole business it needs to prepare for a world in which profit margins will be lower than computer companies have been used to
we approached this not as a response to a temporary condition in the industry but as a fundamental change n the industry is going through <unk> <unk> said
the information - systems industry is still going to be a high - growth business and we confident that we have tremendous assets as a company
but we do n't minimize the challenges of the near term
securities analysts were even more cautious having been burned repeatedly on <unk> this year
some had predicted earnings of more than <unk> a share for this year up from last year fully diluted n a share on earnings of n million
but the company said <unk> that it had losses of n million through the first nine months compared with earnings a year earlier of n million or <unk> a share fully diluted as revenue inched up <unk> to n billion from n billion
and <unk> is expected to do little better than break even in the fourth quarter
so <unk> <unk> at <unk> <unk> said n he is cutting his earnings estimate for next year to <unk> a share from <unk>
i was feeling like i was too high to begin with he said
<unk> <unk> of <unk> associates said <unk> he will remain at <unk> a share for next year but said <unk> he wonders whether even that low target is at risk
the break - even point for next year is much lower but is it low enough he asked
reflecting the concern <unk> stock fell a further n cents to <unk> in composite trading <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
if a tv weatherman gets butterflies facing the camera again after a questionable forecast <unk> <unk> <unk> surely understands
the chief economist of <unk> <unk> <unk> finds himself in such a position as he buzzes the <unk> on his first road trip since backpedaling on a major prediction
<unk> <unk> expects n he will take some heat and he right
since the last time n he traveled this way several months ago he has recanted a series of bold forecasts of a recession
in <unk> n for example <unk> <unk> weekly commentary announced that the economy is likely to fall into recession in early n
the forecasts were widely disseminated and in a splashy ad campaign launched in the summer of <unk> <unk> <unk> urged investors to buy bonds
it said n long - term interest rates then above n could drop to <unk> by the end of <unk> so bonds which benefit from falling rates would be a good buy
the firm also raised the percentage of bonds in its model portfolio from <unk> to n and later to <unk>
but this <unk> just when many market economists including some at <unk> <unk> believed that <unk> <unk> was about to be proved right he took a detour if not a <unk> - turn
he softened the talk about a recession
now in fact he is predicting economic growth of <unk> this year and <unk> next year a more optimistic outlook than the consensus of some four dozen top forecasters surveyed by <unk> <unk> <unk> indicators newsletter
and just recently <unk> <unk> cut the recommended bondholdings back to n
while such changes might sound minor they are n't <unk> <unk> manages or oversees some n billion in retail accounts that include everything from mutual funds to individual annuities
two well - known colleagues who believe <unk> <unk> <unk> was right the first time are <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> both of whom run their own <unk> <unk> research firms
<unk> <unk> said in <unk> that his macroeconomic index signaled recession
<unk> <unk> who was <unk> <unk> chief economist from <unk> to <unk> has heralded a recession for months
my own personal opinion is that <unk> threw in the towel just about the time n he should have doubled his bet he says
now a rocky stock market and weak corporate profits may further threaten the economy
and <unk> <unk> conceded after a recent drop in manufacturing jobs that it may prove to be the case that we got whipsawed that we pulled the recession forecast at just the wrong time
he adds that the forecasting business
however risky the business it brisk these days
pestered by bosses brokers clients and media people and pushed by their own egos <unk> <unk> economists are forecasting about everything from broad economic trends to the dinkiest monthly indicator
but the surprisingly durable seven - year economic expansion has made mincemeat of more than one forecast
this is n't the quiet economic science practiced in the universities
this is the commercial version
carrying the new message on the road <unk> <unk> meets confrontation that often occurs in inverse proportion to the size of the client
no sophisticated professional expects economists to be right all the time
some smaller clients do n't seem to notice his switch
but with some clients the talk can heat up a bit
<unk> <unk> the treasurer of <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> adopts a polite approach waiting for an opportunity to ask about the forecast
a good half - hour into breakfast at the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> looks up from his plate after <unk> <unk> says something about people who believe n interest rates are about to nosedive
i one of them who hope <unk> they will with n billion in debt on the books
is that the forecast <unk> <unk> asks trying to pin down the economist
he does n't fully succeed although <unk> <unk> lists an array of interest - rate scenarios
in a chilly conference room at <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> in contrast the firm money managers seem ready to pin <unk> <unk> to the wall
<unk> <unk> the manager shoves <unk> <unk> handout back at him do we want to go through this
or can we ask you why you changed your forecast just when it about to be right
swiveling in his chair <unk> <unk> replies that the new outlook though still weak does n't justify calling a recession right now
it all in this handout n you do n't want to look at
we could still have a recession at some point
one of <unk> <unk> recurring themes is that the state of the economy is n't a simple black or white
sometimes like now it gray
this somewhat - ambiguous assessment moves one <unk> portfolio manager to ask so what is this a <unk> recession
another challenges <unk> <unk> bond recommendation last year
we not running that ad campaign any more <unk> <unk> snaps in a rare show of irritation
he adds i think n it was a fairly decent call
explaining his change of mind <unk> <unk> says later it hard to pin this on one factor
he says <unk> the economy and especially the employment numbers look much better than he expected interest rates have generally declined inflation has n't run amok
our business is constantly looking at all these things he says
his new forecast calls for a soft landing
and it may be right judging from last week report that inflation - adjusted gross national product rose at a n annual rate in the third quarter
<unk> <unk> understands <unk> <unk> problems
there unbelievable pressure on economists to forecast these numbers he says
you make a forecast and then you become its prisoner
it is indeed hard to back away from a widely publicized forecast and <unk> <unk> is fidgeting with the handcuffs on this trip
his approach to the recantation is direct but low - key
for some time we had forecast negative third and fourth - quarter growth
we pulled that forecast he begins matter - of-factly in a meeting with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> officials in <unk> the first stop
<unk> <unk> said <unk> it holds an <unk> stake in <unk> <unk> <unk> an analytical - instruments maker and may seek control of the company
<unk> a maker of engineered products for aerospace construction defense and other uses made the disclosure in a <unk> and <unk> <unk> filing
in the filing <unk> said that in the past it considered seeking control of <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> through a merger or tender offer and that it expects to continue to evaluate an acquisition from time to time
<unk> officials did n't return phone calls seeking comment
<unk> holds <unk> <unk> <unk> shares including <unk> bought from <unk> n to <unk> for <unk> to n each
in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> composite trading <unk> <unk> <unk> shares leaped <unk> to n each while <unk> sank <unk> to n a share
<unk> <unk> <unk> chief financial officer of <unk> <unk> said <unk> the company has no comment on <unk> filing
<unk> <unk> recently fended off unsolicited overtures from <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> maker of biomedical products
<unk> <unk> disclosed in <unk> that it was approached for a possible acquisition by <unk> <unk> which agreed to purchase <unk> <unk> liquid - chromatography line for n million in <unk>
<unk> <unk> acquired some n of <unk> <unk> common stock before throwing in the towel and reducing its stake in early <unk>
<unk> <unk> began raising its <unk> <unk> stake in <unk> and holds <unk> according to a recent <unk> filing
it has n't made merger overtures to the board
earlier this month <unk> <unk> signed a letter of intent to acquire <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and its sister operation <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
the companies are automotive - emissions-testing concerns
under the terms <unk> <unk> will pay an initial n million for the operations and additional payments during the next four years based on the earnings performance of the businesses
in the nine months <unk> <unk> earned n million or <unk> a share on sales of n million
last week the british displayed unusual political immaturity
the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> resigned because <unk> <unk> <unk> would not fire her trusted adviser <unk> <unk> <unk>
the opposition <unk> <unk> leader <unk> <unk> in a display of the male chauvinism typical of the british lower class denounced <unk> <unk> for having an independent mind and refusing to heed the men in her <unk>
the british press making a mountain out of a molehill precipitated an unnecessary economic crisis by portraying <unk> <unk> as an autocrat who had thrown economic policy into confusion by driving a respected figure from her government
behind the silly posturing lies a real dispute
<unk> <unk> and his european - minded colleagues want the british pound formally tied to the west german mark
<unk> <unk> considers this an ill - advised and costly policy
as there is an effort to anchor the dollar either to gold or other currencies the dispute is worth examining
until his resignation <unk> <unk> had been conducting british monetary policy as if the pound were tied to the mark
when <unk> <unk> cut the top tax rate to <unk> <unk> <unk> flooded the country with money to prevent the pound from rising against the mark
as a result he reignited the inflation that <unk> <unk> through a long and costly effort had subdued
with inflation surging the pound began falling against the mark
to keep the exchange rate pegged <unk> <unk> tightened monetary policy and pushed interest rates up to <unk>
this doubled the mortgage interest rates of the many new homeowners that <unk> <unk> policies had created producing widespread disaffection and pushing labor ahead in the polls
instead of realizing his mistake in letting the exchange rate dominate both british economic policy and <unk> <unk> political fortune <unk> <unk> pushed for tying the pound formally to the mark by entering the <unk> <unk> <unk> which subordinates all member currencies to german monetary policy
this put <unk> <unk> in a bind
the concept of european integration is one of those grand schemes that appeal to intellectuals the media and the imagination but are full of practical pitfalls
if the pound had been tied to the mark the <unk> would have been unable to cut their exorbitant tax rates
the reason is simple
when a country cuts tax rates it makes itself more attractive to investors and drives up the value of its currency
it was fear of disturbing <unk> exchange - rate relationships that caused the <unk> government in <unk> to be timid about cutting tax rates
<unk> <unk> the finance minister at the time was sold on the tax - cut policy but was concerned that his government would be criticized as anti - european for disturbing the linked european currency relationship
the price of attracting capital whether one own or that of foreigners is a trade deficit
to avoid this deficit <unk> <unk> inflated the pound in order to prevent its rise
this misguided policy could not prevent a british trade deficit
consequently <unk> <unk> saddled <unk> <unk> with a record trade deficit renewed inflation and high interest rates three political failures in a row
little wonder that <unk> <unk> opponents were so anxious to keep <unk> <unk> in office
it is extraordinary that the <unk> <unk> thought <unk> it could prevent a trade deficit by inflating the pound
the british balance - of-payments statistics show that after the top tax rate was cut to n the flow abroad of british capital slowed to n billion pounds n billion at the current rate in <unk> from n billion pounds in n
this change in the british capital account required an offsetting change in the trade account a change that could not be prevented by pegging the currency
<unk> <unk> was a victim of the immense confusion in thought that has been characteristic of western financial circles during the n
the most important governments have ignored the role of low tax rates in attracting real capital investment instead emphasizing financial flows in response to high interest rates
this has led them in a fruitless and destructive policy circle
first comes monetary expansion to drive down the currency value that was pushed up by tax - rate reduction
then when the currency falls interest rates are raised to attract financial flows in order to stabilize the exchange rate
this policy is totally mindless and <unk> <unk> is correct to point out its deficiencies
<unk> and all of <unk> need to reconsider the prospects for european integration in light of the possible reunification and neutralization of <unk>
a unified <unk> that remained within the western alliance would give <unk> such an overshadowing position that all other members of a unified <unk> would become vassals of the german state
unless the <unk> <unk> collapses german reunification is likely to require <unk> neutralization
the implications for <unk> <unk> and the rest of <unk> of having their currencies tied to the economic policy of a neutral country need considering before we judge <unk> <unk> resignation to be unfortunate
in the least we must recognize the futility of trying to use exchange - rate intervention to offset the effects of tax - rate reduction on capital flows
<unk> <unk> was assistant <unk> secretary under <unk> <unk>

personal spending which fueled the economy growth in the third quarter was clearly slowing by the end of the period raising questions about the economy strength as the year ends
personal spending grew <unk> in <unk> to a n trillion annual rate the <unk> <unk> said <unk>
it was the smallest monthly increase in a year
at the same time personal income was held down by the effects of <unk> <unk> which tore through parts of <unk> and <unk> <unk> in late <unk>
the department said n personal income rose n in <unk> to a n trillion rate but would have climbed <unk> had it not been for the storm
among the economic effects of the hurricane was a sharp drop in rental income
the figures came a day after the government released a report showing that consumer spending propelled <unk> economic expansion in the third quarter while on an inflation - adjusted basis business investment slowed government spending declined and exports were flat
but the new statistics show that by <unk> the burst in spending seemed to be tapering off
many economists expect the weakness to continue
i think n the consumer has pretty well played himself out said <unk> <unk> senior economist at <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>
i do n't think n there a lot in the wings in other sectors of the economy <unk> to keep growth above n he said
in the third quarter the economy grew at a moderate n annual rate

transition is a reference to the company five - year restructuring effort
during that time <unk> <unk> had losses of more than n billion
now following asset sales that shrank revenue by more than one - third this year alone <unk> <unk> is flush with cash
so its senior executives are talking openly about possibly buying back some of the company n million in subordinated convertible debentures next year
we like to continue to reduce debt <unk> <unk> <unk> said
noting that the company is offering to buy back n million in senior notes paying n n he said n the response will help determine future debt - reduction efforts
the offer was automatically triggered by the recent sale of <unk> <unk> <unk> disk - drive business to <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> who is also acting chief financial officer and the odds - on favorite n to become the next chief executive said n the company is achieving modest positive cash flow from operations and we expect that to continue into <unk>

last week <unk> <unk> reported third - quarter earnings of n million or n cents a share on revenue of n million
through the first nine months the company had a loss of n million largely reflecting the closing of its supercomputer unit
while a few assets are still being shopped including the sports and entertainment ticketing portion of the company <unk> unit <unk> <unk> said <unk> future restructuring would be a question of strategy
we do n't need the cash
<unk> automated wagering business which operates lotteries in a half dozen states is not for sale the company said n

at the same time four of six design projects were spiked he said n

well the arrogant <unk> <unk> media have spoken again going for the <unk> editorial <unk> n
having resided in the great state of <unk> for the past seven years i find it hard to ignore our environmental problems when i start my commute to work with eyes tearing and head aching from the polluted air when i try to enjoy the beaches and come home covered with tar and oil when i hear of numerous deaths related to irresponsible processing of cheese and use of chemicals in fruit growing
perhaps it entertaining for those like you to discount the concerns of environmentalists suggesting that their save - the-earth initiatives are whacky and referring to so many citizens as la - la activists
strange that we do n't hear similar criticisms of the <unk> <unk> activists who seek to clean up <unk> <unk> or rid their beaches of medical waste
while there are no easy low - cost solutions simply ignoring our problems will result in their severity increasing and spreading throughout the state the nation and the world
if nothing else such initiatives as these will provide an awareness to citizens and lawmakers and encourage appropriate corrective action
before your next <unk> - bashing editorial please spend more time out here witnessing the situation it just may change your view
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
i realize n you were just looking for something snotty <unk> to say about <unk> and its environmental movement but picking <unk> <unk> <unk> to say it for you was a bad call
<unk> organic architecture demonstrated a keen sensitivity to the environment decades before it became fashionable among la - la activists
indeed <unk> said all his life that the greatest lessons n he learned were derived from the study of nature
obviously it lost on you that about n of the american people these days and in fact the president of the <unk> <unk> consider themselves environmentalists
as for <unk> being a state run by liberal environmental loonies let not forget where <unk> <unk> came from
perhaps <unk> <unk> who claimed that air pollution is caused by trees is the man n you should be quoting to back up your position that economics is more important than the <unk>
but it was <unk> <unk> <unk> who said is this not anti - <unk>
the <unk> that knows no <unk> but more
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
your editorial was commendable and neatly matched by the readers comments in letters to the editor <unk> <unk> on the side of caution
the illogic and inaccuracy of <unk> <unk> <unk> comments for the <unk> resources <unk> <unk> fully justifies your characterization of <unk> <unk> in particular as la - la activists
we may all hope that <unk> voters will heed the scientific realities that their own university renowned <unk> . <unk> <unk> provides them and ignore the charlatanry profferred by their wealthy <unk> weepers
i have a different approach <unk> to offer not only to californians but to all americans

if this battle were a movie the producers would be fighting over two scripts with nothing but an opening scene in common
in the opener <unk> <unk> would agree to buy <unk> pictures <unk> <unk> in a transaction valued at close to n billion
shortly after that <unk> would offer to buy <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> for n million and offer its co - chairmen <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> the chance to run <unk>
<unk> <unk> would fly to <unk> <unk> with the intention of telling <unk> communications <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> - <unk> planned to end its five - year contract to produce movies exclusively for <unk>
that where the two scripts would diverge
in affidavits filed in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in connection with the n billion breach - of-contract suit <unk> <unk> brought against <unk> for hiring the two producers <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> tell one story
<unk> tells another
in the affidavits <unk> <unk> says <unk> he was shocked when <unk> <unk> refused a meeting and made it clear n he would stop them
<unk> <unk> claims <unk> he reminded <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> the top executives of the <unk> brothers studio had repeatedly agreed that we had every right to accept an offer such as <unk>
in response <unk> <unk> says <unk> <unk> <unk> referred to his colleagues at <unk> with an obscenity and said tell them that they do n't have a job
you can take them with you
<unk> denies <unk> <unk> <unk> ever said any such thing and in fact denies virtually everything <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> say in their affidavits
tomorrow <unk> will file another batch of documents contending that the essence of everything n these guys are saying is basically lies says <unk> <unk> chief outside counsel <unk> <unk>
<unk> a judge is scheduled to rule on <unk> motion seeking to block the <unk> - <unk> duo from going to <unk>
the battery of legal documents filed in the past week in connection with the suit provide a peek into the inner workings of this <unk> dogfight
but they also make it clear that the first thing <unk> a judge will have to decide is which if any version of events in this morass is fiction and which fact
the matter may never even be tried in court
<unk> says that what it really wants is for the producers to fulfill their contractual obligations but the bitterness of this battle and the accusations flying on both sides make it unlikely that the decade - long relationship between <unk> and its two most prolific producers can ever be repaired
<unk> which is in the process of merging with <unk> <unk> <unk> says n it is willing to settle the matter out of court
so far however <unk> has n't been willing to meet its considerable financial demands
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> do n't have much n to gain from a protracted battle
<unk> for its part could decide that the cost of a <unk> settlement or court fight is too high choosing instead to find someone else n to run <unk> although that too would be costly given the financial arrangement already guaranteed to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
in that case <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> might not suffer financially but they would be left without their dream job of running a studio and with a considerably scarred relationship with <unk>
at the center of any court fight will be the differing interpretations of the written contract between <unk> and the two producers but other murkier issues will play a big role
<unk> and the <unk> - <unk> team are hanging much of their case on <unk> willingness last year to release the producers from another contract and on an oral agreement n they say n allowed them to terminate the current written contract if the opportunity to run a major studio came up
<unk> denies <unk> such an agreement was made and disputes the <unk> - <unk> version of virtually every telephone call and meeting n the two sides had on the matter
just how rancorous the relationship has become is clear from the differing versions of the two sides current business dealings
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> say in their affidavits that <unk> already is taking steps to freeze them out of their projects at <unk> notably the <unk> <unk> film <unk> and <unk>
<unk> <unk> says in his affidavit that the movie staff was told last week that <unk> was taking over the picture and n another producer would be giving all of the orders
over his objections <unk> <unk> says <unk> the film release date was moved up by many months to <unk> and plans for a soundtrack worth millions of dollars were dropped
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> an editor on the film backs <unk> <unk> in a separate sworn declaration
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> says <unk> <unk> brothers production president <unk> <unk> called him <unk> <unk> and said <unk> <unk> <unk> is off the picture
if he calls you up just tell him n everything is fine
the editor also says n the new producer on the film <unk> <unk> told editors to screen the picture without telling stars <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk>
the less they know the easier it is for us
if someone asks just lie and tell them n it will be done <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> says <unk> <unk> <unk> told them
that says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is a total n lie
the movie he says <unk> is in its post - production stages of cleaning up the film
he says <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> as the contractual producers with consultation rights have been invited to screenings and to give their input on the film
dozens of <unk> - <unk> staffers are still working on the <unk> lot and consulting on various projects on a daily basis the attorney says n
<unk> <unk> in his affidavit says that when he advised <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> offer at lunch on <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> hugged and congratulated me and expressed joy that we had finally realized our long - term ambition of running and having an equity position in a major entertainment company
<unk> <unk> says <unk> he brought to lunch a release document <unk> <unk> had agreed to in <unk> when he and <unk> <unk> made an aborted bid to buy part of <unk> <unk> <unk> to run the <unk> studio
<unk> <unk> says <unk> he had crossed out <unk> with a red pen and written in <unk> giving the document to <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> said absolutely nothing n to indicate <unk> <unk> would have any objection to our assuming management positions at <unk> <unk> <unk> says
<unk> <unk> in his affidavit does n't mention any hugging or congratulating
he says <unk> he told <unk> <unk> <unk> he could n't sign any documents and that the deal although apparently a good one for him and <unk> <unk> would have a very negative impact on <unk>
he said n he would contact <unk> <unk> and <unk> brothers <unk> <unk> <unk> and that in a conference call the three agreed n they could n't let the producers out of their contract
<unk> <unk> in his own affidavit says n he and <unk> <unk> instructed <unk> <unk> to tell the producers <unk> <unk> would n't terminate their agreement
<unk> <unk> says that <unk> <unk> did convey that information and that <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> was crazy because of the <unk> deal meaning <unk> <unk> says that <unk> <unk> did not want to communicate to his new merger partner <unk> <unk> that <unk> agreements provided for our departure under these circumstances
<unk> <unk> also says in his affidavit that <unk> <unk> told us that even if <unk> did not want us <unk> relationship with us already was irreparably damaged that there was no way n to put the egg together and that it would sue <unk> for tons of money
moreover <unk> <unk> claims <unk> <unk> <unk> told him that <unk> <unk> probably would n't object if it were anybody other than <unk>
but <unk> is a problem
the <unk> - <unk> side has said <unk> <unk> is particularly concerned about the prospect of a huge japanese company controlling important segments of the <unk> entertainment business
some in <unk> suggest <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> took encouragement from <unk> studio executives such as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> too literally
according to this theory <unk> executives hoping to strengthen their relationships with the producers encouraged <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> in their ambitions to build a major entertainment company
but the <unk> executives in their affidavits deny ever telling the producers <unk> they could get out of their written contract
<unk> <unk> the <unk> attorney says n the studio still wants the producers to come back and fulfill their contract
they are like a mini - studio they have n projects in development for <unk> he says
but <unk> <unk> indicates in his affidavit that not all of the projects will be used
for example he says that since n he and <unk> <unk> have developed over <unk> movie projects and <unk> has passed or chosen not to produce at least n
as for the projects remaining at <unk> <unk> <unk> says <unk> <unk> <unk> informed me that <unk> producers have already started a feeding frenzy for our projects
<unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> it has acquired a <unk> cable television company and a <unk> publishing firm
terms on both deals were n't disclosed
the media company said n it purchased <unk> <unk> <unk> a privately held cable television system in <unk> <unk> <unk> a suburb of <unk>
the system is still under construction and will serve a market of <unk> homes
the company also has acquired <unk> publishers and distributors <unk> a family owned producer and distributor of educational materials in <unk> <unk>
despite politicians hand - wringing about the federal budget the government ended fiscal <unk> with a n billion deficit about the same as the two previous years
even <unk> <unk> budget director <unk> <unk> had trouble finding a silver lining in the report
i suppose n you could say n the good news is that the deficits are not heading up he said but you ca n't be satisfied with deficits at this level and we not
the federal deficit was n billion in <unk> and <unk> billion in <unk>
the n deficit would have been nearly n billion larger had the government been able to spend as much as <unk> intended on cleaning up the thrift industry before the year ended on <unk> n
because the <unk> <unk> <unk> could n't spend the money fast enough the savings - and-loan outlays were pushed into fiscal n
nevertheless the <unk> deficit still exceeded the <unk> billion target set by the <unk> - <unk> deficit - reduction law by <unk> billion a reminder of that law shortcomings
the law sets a deficit target of <unk> billion for fiscal <unk>
a partisan fight over cutting capital - gains taxes has slowed the progress of <unk> deficit - reduction legislation almost to a halt triggering across - the-board spending cuts under the <unk> - <unk> law
the <unk> <unk> and the democratic leadership in <unk> blame each other for turning capital - gains taxes into such a divisive issue this year
neither side showed any sign of retreating
meeting with reporters <unk> <unk> <unk> again said <unk> he would rather live with across - the-board spending cuts than accept a deficit - reduction bill like the one passed by the <unk> which would increase spending in future years
underscoring the size of the deficits of the past few years the <unk> report showed that for the first time interest paid on the public debt n billion exceeded spending on <unk> <unk> the single largest government program
in all federal outlays amounted to n trillion in <unk> up n from the previous year the <unk> said n
<unk> revenues rose n to n billion
the <unk> said <unk> a surge in tax receipts noted earlier in the year did n't turn out to be quite as strong as it first appeared
the <unk> marked up its forecast by n million in <unk> but that proved to be about <unk> billion too optimistic
the government ran a deficit of <unk> billion in <unk> compared with a surplus of <unk> billion in <unk> n
outlays for the month totaled n billion up from <unk> billion a year earlier
the increase reflects spending on the s&l rescue as well as payroll and <unk> <unk> checks normally issued in <unk> that were issued in <unk> this year because <unk> n fell on a <unk>
revenues were n billion up from <unk> billion a year earlier

consumers <unk> <unk> now the main unit of <unk> <unk> ran into financial problems over its <unk> billion <unk> nuclear plant which was abandoned as a nuclear facility in <unk> because of construction delays and high costs
<unk> is nearly done converting the <unk> plant to a gas - fired cogeneration facility at a cost of n million
<unk> management said <unk> that they planned to recommend paying a modest dividend when the board of directors met <unk>
the dividend will be paid <unk> n to shares of record <unk> n
the company suffered a loss of n million in <unk> but its financial situation has been improving since then
<unk> <unk> said n it expects to receive about n million in federal income - tax refunds and interest from a court ruling on a tax dispute
the health - care company said <unk> it expects the refund to be included in the first quarter ending <unk> n
the refund is about n million
accrued interest on the refund was about n million as of <unk> n
the refund stems from a court ruling that found n certain payments by <unk> subsidiaries to its insurance subsidiary during fiscal <unk> through n were deductible as premiums for liability insurance
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> agreement to acquire n of <unk> <unk> <unk> proves that foreign companies can acquire japanese companies if the alternative for the japanese company is extinction

japanese government officials eager to rebut foreign criticism of japanese investments overseas hailed the transaction as proof n foreigners can make similar investments in <unk>
<unk> <unk> chairman <unk> <unk> echoed the official japanese view of the accord which was announced <unk>
the myths that <unk> is not open to concerns from outside has i think n been demolished at a stroke <unk> <unk> said
but analysts say n <unk> is a special case
it expects to post a loss of n billion yen for the year ending tomorrow and its liabilities currently exceed its assets by about n billion yen
if you find sound healthy companies in <unk> they are not for sale said <unk> <unk> a management - consultant at <unk> - based <unk> <unk> services <unk>
statistics on acquisitions by foreigners vary in detail because unlike <unk> which is listed on the <unk> and <unk> stock exchanges most of the japanese companies acquired by foreigners are privately held
but by all accounts foreign companies have bought only a relative handful of japanese companies this year while japanese companies have acquired hundreds of foreign companies
nor do analysts expect the <unk> deal to touch off a fresh wave of foreign purchases
if the strong yen and the high stock prices of japanese companies were n't deterrents enough webs of cross - shareholdings between friendly japanese companies and fiercely independent japanese corporate attitudes repel most would - be acquirers
usually when a japanese company is ready to sell it has few alternatives remaining and the grim demeanors of <unk> directors at a joint news conference here left little doubt that this was not the company finest hour
<unk> was once one of <unk> premier makers of expensive high - quality stereo gear for audiophiles
but in recent years the market has moved toward less expensive mini - component sets miniaturized amplifiers and receivers and software players that could be stacked on top of each other
some of sansui fellow audio - specialty companies such as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> responded to the challenge by quickly bringing out mini - component products of their own by moving heavily into the booming compact disk businesses or by diversifying into other consumer - electronics fields including laser disks or portable cassette players
<unk> was late into the mini - component business and failed to branch into other new businesses
as the yen soared in recent years <unk> deepening financial problems became a vicious circle
while competitors moved production offshore in response to the sagging competitiveness of japanese factories <unk> lacked the money <unk> to build new plants in <unk> <unk>
our company has not been able to cope very effectively with changes in the marketplace said <unk> <unk> <unk> president
but even a japanese company that looks like a dog may turn out to be a good investment for a foreign concern some management consultants maintain n
<unk> <unk> a management consultant for <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> his firm will likely be recommending acquisitions of japanese companies more often to foreign clients in the future
attitudes toward being acquired are still negative but they becoming more positive <unk> <unk> said
in some industries like pharmaceuticals acquisitions make sense
whether <unk> <unk> acquisition makes sense remains to be seen but at the news conference <unk> <unk> brimmed with self - confidence that he can turn <unk> around
<unk> he said <unk> is a perfect fit for <unk> <unk> electronics operations which make televisions videocassette recorders microwaves and other products on an original equipment maker basis for sale under other companies brand names
he said <unk> <unk> <unk> will greatly expand <unk> product line using <unk> engineers to design the new products and will move <unk> production of most products other than sophisticated audio gear offshore into <unk> <unk> own factories
whatever capital it <unk> needs so it can compete and become a totally global entity capable of competing with the best in the world that capital will be injected <unk> <unk> said
and while <unk> <unk> is n't jettisoning the existent top - management structure of <unk> it is bringing in a former <unk> <unk> executive as executive vice president and chief operating officer
such risk taking is an everyday matter for the brash <unk> <unk> who is n owner of <unk> <unk> as well as its chairman
he took <unk> <unk> once a small fabric wholesaler and used it at as a base n to build a conglomerate that has been doubling its profits annually since <unk>
in <unk> it announced plans to acquire the tropical - fruit business of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> foods unit for n million n million
last month <unk> <unk> posted a <unk> jump in pretax profit for the first half to n million from n million on a <unk> rise in sales
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> contributed to this article
the bolstered cellular agreement between <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> carries heightened risks and could fail to fend off <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the rival suitor for <unk>
moreover the amended pact shows how <unk> persistence has pushed <unk> and <unk> into a corner forcing huge debt on the proposed new company
the debt estimated at n billion could mortgage the cellular company future earning power in order to placate some <unk> holders in the short term
the plan still calls for <unk> to combine its cellular telephone properties with <unk> and to spin off its broadcasting operations
but under new terms of the agreement announced <unk> <unk> holders would receive a special cash dividend of <unk> a share representing a payout of about <unk> billion shortly before the proposed merger
<unk> said n it expects to borrow the money <unk> to pay the dividend but commitments from banks still have n't been obtained
under previous terms holders would have received a dividend of only <unk> a share
in addition <unk> <unk> - based <unk> would exercise its right to buy out for n billion the <unk> equity interest of its partner <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> cellular franchise
that money also would have to be borrowed
in effect <unk> has forced <unk> hand by bidding <unk> billion for the stake earlier this month
we taking on more debt than we would have liked to acknowledged <unk> <unk> <unk> vice president and treasurer
although he expressed confidence that the proposed new company cash flow would be sufficient to cover interest payments on the debt he estimated that the company would n't be profitable until n or later
<unk> estimate the value of the <unk> proposal at about <unk> to n a share
they value <unk> bid at <unk> to n a share
the previous <unk> pact was valued at about <unk> to n a share
<unk> the largest provider of cellular telephone service in the <unk> already owns about n of <unk> stock
in response to <unk> amended pact the <unk> <unk> company extended its own offer to buy n million <unk> shares for <unk> apiece which would give <unk> a <unk> controlling interest
over the weekend <unk> continued to call for an auction of <unk>
analysts said <unk> they expect <unk> to escalate the bidding again
this game is n't over yet said <unk> <unk> <unk> a vice president at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
at some point it will become non - economical for one company
but i do n't think n we at that point yet
under its revised proposal <unk> - based <unk> would have a n interest in the new cellular company and would be responsible for half of its debt
to sweeten the pact further and to ease concerns of institutional investors <unk> added a provision designed to give extra protection to holders if the regional <unk> company ever decides to buy the rest of the new cellular company
the provision described as back - end protection would require <unk> to pay a price equivalent to what an outside party might have to pay
<unk> bid also has a similar clause
only <unk> proposal requires the company to begin an auction process in <unk> <unk> for remaining shares at third - party prices
to mollify shareholders concerned about the long - term value of the company under the <unk> - <unk> agreement <unk> also agreed to pay as much as <unk> a share or n million if after five years the trading value of the new cellular company is n't as high as the value that shareholders would have realized from the <unk> offer
we very pleased with the new deal
we did n't expect <unk> to be so responsive said <unk> <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which holds n <unk> shares
<unk> back - end protection was flawed previously
we think n this is a superior deal to <unk>
we surprised
we did n't think <unk> a sleeping <unk> mentality would be willing to take on dilution
but <unk> <unk> a telecommunications analyst with <unk> <unk> <unk> finds the <unk> proposal still flawed because the company does n't have to wait five years to begin buying more <unk> shares
how many shares will be around in <unk> he asked
there nothing preventing <unk> from buying up shares in the meanwhile
<unk> revised proposal surprised many industry analysts especially because of the company willingness to accept some dilution of future earnings
<unk> <unk> <unk> president of the company <unk> enterprises <unk> unit said <unk> the revised agreement with <unk> would dilute <unk> earnings by about n in both <unk> and <unk> and by significantly less thereafter
indeed <unk> cellular operations were among the first in the country n to become profitable
for <unk> <unk> earned <unk> billion or <unk> a share on revenue of <unk> billion
analysts were predicting <unk> <unk> earnings in the range of <unk> a share or n billion but now those estimates are being scaled back
in composite trading <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> shares fell n cents to <unk>
in national over - the-counter trading <unk> shares soared <unk> to closed at n while <unk> fell <unk> a share to n
the proposed <unk> - <unk> cellular company including the newly acquired <unk> stake would give the new entity n million potential customers including about n million in the nation top n markets
<unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> speculated that <unk> in an attempt to buy time might consider filing an antitrust suit against <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who oversees enforcement of the consent decree that broke up the <unk> system in <unk>
indeed <unk> seemed to hint at that option in a brief statement
urging <unk> directors to conduct a fair auction on a level playing field <unk> asked how well the public interest would be served with the <unk> operating companies controlling over n of all cellular potential customers in the nation top n markets
market makers in <unk> over - the-counter stocks are adding their voices to the swelling chorus of complaints about program trading
their motivation however has a strong practical aspect <unk> trading is hazardous to their paychecks
the most controversial form of program trading stock - index arbitrage is making it tough for traders to make money declares <unk> <unk> head of <unk> trading at <unk> <unk> <unk>
stock - index arbitrage the computer - guided buying and selling of stocks with offsetting trades in stock - index futures <unk> to profit from fleeting price discrepancies affects the <unk> market directly through the n stocks included in <unk> <unk> <unk> index
the <unk> <unk> is often used in arbitrage strategies
the portion of <unk> volume attributable to program trading is n't known as it is on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> where it amounted to more than <unk> in <unk>
estimates from traders put it at less than n of <unk> average daily volume of roughly n million shares
other market - maker gripes <unk> trading also causes the <unk> <unk> <unk> to lose ground against other segments of the stock market
because of program trading it is more difficult to trade many <unk> stocks without sharp price moves a condition known as illiquidity
moreover the price volatility that is amplified by program trading is undercutting efforts to woo individual investors back to an <unk> market that sorely misses them
some of these problems are neither new nor unique to the <unk> market
but the big often tumultuous slide in stock prices this month has turned some of those who have been profiting from the practice against it
<unk> <unk> head of retail equity trading at <unk> <unk> <unk> acknowledges that he was n't troubled by program trading when it began in the pre - crash bull market because it added liquidity and people were pleased to see stock prices rising
we were n't as concerned until they became sell programs says <unk> <unk> who now thinks <unk> it adds unnecessary volatility
<unk> <unk> however executes program trades for clients
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> in addition to <unk> do program - trade <unk> stocks
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> say n they do so only for customers however
<unk> <unk> does program trading for its own as well as clients accounts
of course there were sell programs in past years too but they seem to hurt market makers more painfully these days
that largely because of defensive measures n they adopted after the <unk> crash when individual investors fled the market and trading activity dwindled
market makers to cut costs slashed inventories of stocks n they keep on hand n to sell investors when other holders are n't selling
and to protect their reduced capital investment from eroding further market makers became quicker to lower price quotes when sell programs are in progress
on days when prices are tumbling they must be willing to buy shares from sellers when no one else will
in such an environment market makers can suffer huge losses both on trades made that day at steadily dropping prices and in the value of their inventories of shares
it makes no sense for us to put money at risk when you know n you going to lose says <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
but this skittishness <unk> <unk> says <unk> is creating liquidity problems in certain <unk> stocks
it harder to sell stocks when the sell programs come in because some market makers do n't want to take the orders
no one has big positions and no one wants to take big risks
<unk> <unk> president of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> which oversees trading on <unk> agrees that program trading is hurting the market efforts to bring back small investors
but he observes n while makers suffer losses when program trading drags the market down they also make money when program trading pushes the prices higher
sometimes traders lose sight of that he says
the <unk> stocks in the <unk> <unk> include <unk> biggest such as <unk> <unk> <unk> communications <unk> - <unk> and <unk> <unk>
these big stocks greatly influence the <unk> <unk> <unk>
when the computers say sell the composite tumbles as well as the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the problem market makers say <unk> is that while the industrial average and the <unk> <unk> usually recover as buy programs kick in the <unk> <unk> frequently is left behind
eight trading days after <unk> n the day before the stock market plunge for instance the <unk> <unk> had fallen n compared with n for the <unk> <unk> <unk> for the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> for the industrial average
this gap eventually closes but slowly
three days later as of <unk> close the <unk> <unk> was down n compared with n for the industrial average n for the <unk> <unk> and <unk> for the <unk> <unk> <unk>
the main reason for this lag is that individual investors own <unk> of the <unk> market capitalization according to <unk> <unk> much more than on the <unk> <unk>
such investors tend to be more cautious than institutional investors are about re - entering the market after massive selloffs market makers say n

when <unk> <unk> <unk> took the podium at a recent cosmetics industry event more than <unk> executives packing the room snapped to attention
<unk> <unk> who runs <unk> <unk> world - wide personal - care business paused to scan the crowd
i see <unk> we have about half the audience working for us he said tongue in cheek
the other half we may have before long
members of the audience gasped or laughed nervously their industry has been unsettled recently by acquisitions
first <unk> the anglo - dutch packaged - goods giant spent n billion to acquire brands such as <unk> and <unk> <unk>
it now holds the no . n position at <unk> department - store cosmetic counters
then <unk> <unk> <unk> agreed to buy <unk> <unk> for n billion
that acquisition n to be completed by year end will include the <unk> <unk> and <unk> makeup lines making <unk> the top marketer of cosmetics in mass - market outlets
it not so much the idea of acquisitions that has agitated the cosmetics industry as the companies doing the acquiring <unk> and <unk> bring with them great experience with mundane products like soap and toilet paper sparking disdain in the glitzy cosmetics trade but they also bring mammoth marketing clout sparking fear
though it is far from certain that companies best known for selling <unk> margarine and <unk> detergent will succeed in cosmetics there little doubt n they will shake up the industry
for now both companies are keeping quiet about their specific plans
but industry watchers expect them to blend the methodical marketing strategies n they use for more mundane products with the more intuitive approach typical of cosmetics companies
likely changes include more emphasis on research soaring advertising budgets and aggressive pricing
but some cosmetics - industry executives wonder whether techniques honed in packaged goods will translate to the cosmetics business
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other cosmetics houses traditionally have considered themselves fashion enterprises whose product development is guided by the creative intuition of their executives
cosmetics companies roll out new makeup colors several times a year and since most products can be easily copied by competitors they loath to test them with consumers
just because upscale cosmetics look like packaged goods and smell like packaged goods it does n't mean <unk> they are packaged goods says <unk> <unk> chief executive of <unk> <unk>
they really fashion items wrapped up in little jars
in contrast to the more artistic nature of traditional cosmetics houses <unk> and <unk> are the habitats of organization men in gray - flannel suits
both companies are conservative marketers that rely on extensive market research
<unk> in particular rarely rolls out a product nationally before extensive test - marketing
both can be extremely aggressive at pricing such products as soaps and diapers to the extent that some industry consultants predict n cents - off coupons for mascara could result from their entry into the field
<unk> already has shown <unk> it can meld some traditional packaged - goods techniques with the image - making of the cosmetics trade in the mass - market end of the business
consider <unk> of <unk> which <unk> acquired as part of <unk> - <unk> <unk> in <unk>
the moisturizer introduced in <unk> had a dowdy image
oil of <unk> brought with it the baggage of being used basically by older women who had already aged says <unk> <unk> a consultant with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> set out to reposition the brand by broadening the product line to include facial cleansers and moisturizers for sensitive skin
it also redesigned <unk> of <unk> packaging stamping the traditional pink boxes with gold lines to create a more opulent look
moreover <unk> shifted its ad campaign from one targeting older women to one featuring a woman in her <unk> vowing not to grow old gracefully
the company says n sales have soared
goliaths like <unk> and <unk> have enormous financial advantages over smaller rivals
next year <unk> plans to roll out a perfume called <unk> says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman of <unk>
without <unk> backing <unk> might not have been able to spend the estimated n million to n million needed to accomplish that without scrimping on its existing brands
packaged - goods companies will make it tougher for smaller people to remain competitive <unk> <unk> says <unk>
further consolidations in the industry could follow
rumors that <unk> is interested in acquiring <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> unit are widespread
<unk> wo n't comment <unk> however denies <unk> the brand is for sale
the presence of <unk> and <unk> is likely to increase the impact of advertising on cosmetics
while the two are among the world biggest advertisers most makers of upscale cosmetics spend relatively little on national ads
instead they focus on events in department stores and pour their promotional budgets into gifts that go along with purchases
<unk> <unk> for example spends only an estimated n of sales on advertising in the <unk> and <unk> <unk> says n he has no plans to change his strategy
the most dramatic changes however probably will come in new - product development
nearly n of cosmetics sales come through mass - distribution outlets such as drug stores and supermarkets according to <unk> <unk> an analyst at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
that figure has been inching up for several years
as the trend continues demand for mass - market items that are high quality but only mid - priced particularly skin - care products is expected to increase
this fall for example <unk> <unk> ordinarily a high - end line rolled out a drug - store line of skin - care products called plenitude which retail for <unk> to n
the packaged - goods marketers may try filling that gap with a spate of new products
unlike the old - line cosmetics houses <unk> and <unk> both have enormous research and development bases n to draw on for new products
<unk> in fact is noted for gaining market leadership by introducing products that offer a technical edge over the competition
sales of its <unk> detergent soared earlier this year for example after <unk> introduced a version that includes a bleach safe for all colors and fabrics
that led industry executives to speculate that future product development will be driven more by technological innovation than by fashion whims especially among mass - market brands
there will be more emphasis on quality says <unk> <unk> chief executive of <unk> <unk> the <unk> licensee of <unk>
you see fewer gimmicks
but success for <unk> and <unk> is far from guaranteed as shown by the many consumer - product companies that have tried and failed to master the quirky beauty business
in the <unk> several pharmaceutical and packaged - goods companies including <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> - <unk> acquired cosmetics companies
industry consultants say <unk> only <unk> - <unk> which makes the mass - market <unk> has maintained a meaningful business
<unk> which acquired <unk> <unk> in <unk> sold the brand seven years later after the brand languished
<unk> already has experienced some disappointment
the mass - market <unk> brand which it acquired in n along with <unk> - <unk> <unk> has lost share according to industry analysts
the ritzy world of department - store cosmetics retailing where <unk> is concentrating its efforts may prove even more treacherous
in this niche makeup colors change seasonally because they are linked to ready - to-wear fashions
because brand loyalty is weak and most cosmetics purchases are unplanned careful training of store sales staffs by cosmetics companies is important
and cultivating a luxury image strong enough to persuade consumers to pay more than <unk> for lipstick or eye makeup requires a subtle touch that packaged - goods companies have yet to demonstrate on their own
there may be a truce in the long war of nerves between the <unk> <unk> and <unk> over how this country conducts secret intelligence operations abroad
after years of mistrust born of <unk> past misdeeds of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> - <unk> scandal <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> appear ready for now at least to trust each other when it comes to setting policy on covert activities
if that attitude lasts it could infuse covert action planning with a level of care and confidence that has n't been seen in years
over the past week the president has agreed to keep the committee informed usually in advance of covert actions and to put key intelligence decisions in writing
that was n't always the way n the <unk> administration handled such matters
<unk> <unk> has pledged as well to respect the <unk> executive order barring <unk> agents from assassinating foreign leaders or helping others to do so
<unk> never fully trusted former <unk> chief <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to honor the ban
despite objections by the <unk> <unk> <unk> also has agreed to the establishment of an inspector general at the <unk> who would be independent of the <unk> director
in return the <unk> panel has dropped efforts to enact legislation requiring the administration to inform it within <unk> hours of the launching of any covert activity
it also has removed a ban on <unk> use of a contingency fund for covert acts and has agreed to wipe away some tortured and legalistic restrictions on coup planning put in place to ensure that the <unk> did n't get back in the assassination game
we finally been able to convince them that <unk> and <unk> <unk> do n't work here anymore says one administration official
the new understanding did n't just spring to life in a spontaneous eruption of sweetness and light
it emerged after a rancorous display of old - style intelligence politics that followed this month failed coup attempt in <unk>
the <unk> <unk> used television appearances and leaks to argue that congressionally imposed restrictions on covert actions made <unk> support for such coups difficult
<unk> <unk> even disclosed privately that one <unk> - era deal with <unk> required him to notify the odious panamanian dictator <unk> <unk> if the <unk> learned of a coup plot that might endanger his life
the president also hinted n he might veto this year intelligence authorization bill if it is too restrictive
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for their part angrily accused the <unk> <unk> of selectively leaking classified documents and trying unfairly to shift the blame to <unk> for the bungled attempt to topple <unk> <unk>
the <unk> <unk> got the better of the exchange but took care not to press its advantage to the kind of constitutional confrontation sought by conservative republicans who do n't want any congressional oversight of intelligence activities
instead <unk> <unk> and his aides made it clear n they respected <unk> role and felt <unk> they could work with the conservative <unk> <unk> and the moderate <unk> <unk> to iron out their differences
the senators responded in kind
<unk> <unk> happily told reporters that there had been a meeting of the minds with the <unk> <unk> and that the committee had given <unk> <unk> a clean slate free of the impediments imposed during the <unk> years
<unk> <unk> said <unk> the relationship has reverted to its pre - <unk> character
there still are some details n to be nailed down
<unk> <unk> is reserving the right in rare instances to keep <unk> in the dark asserting a constitutional prerogative <unk> the committee does n't recognize
and a pending <unk> <unk> interpretation of the assassination ban could raise questions that would have to be settled
moreover both sides may face political critics
some conservatives will accuse the president of promising <unk> too much
and they continue anonymously attacking <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for being too accommodating to the committee
at the same time some congressional liberals will accuse <unk> . <unk> and <unk> of wimping out and they will warn that the lawmakers concessions raise the specter of more internationally embarrassing covert operations like the mining of nicaraguan harbors and the <unk> arms sales
but if the cooperative attitude holds and there is greater consultation on covert activities the country could be entering an era when such hare - brained schemes are scrapped before they get off the drawing boards while risky but well - planned secret operations can be undertaken without fear that a panicky <unk> will balk
several of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> own listed companies led by giant <unk> <unk> are joining for the first time to complain about program trading and the exchange role in it
claiming n program trading has turned the <unk> <unk> into a gambling casino <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said that he and at least n other corporate executives are forming an unprecedented alliance
the group <unk> <unk> said <unk> in an interview wants to end the market wild price swings that critics blame on computer - aided program - trading strategies
the group will complain to <unk> to the heads of program - trading firms and to the heads of the <unk> <unk> itself he said n
they should call the exchange <unk> <unk> charged <unk> <unk> the <unk> founder of <unk> who also a former investment banker and stock trader
what is the mission of the financial community
to help some scavengers or schemers or help corporate <unk>
<unk> is a n billion telephone and electronics company
pressure has been building on the <unk> <unk> in the past two weeks to do something about market volatility which many investors say <unk> is caused by program trading
the market <unk> plunge of <unk> points in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> understated response to it galvanized some longstanding dissatisfaction among companies listed on the exchange
last month program trading accounted for a record n of average daily <unk> <unk> volume
<unk> <unk> for example said <unk> he wrote to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> about program trading after the <unk> <unk> plunge and as in previous queries what i get back is gobbledygook
he said <unk> he upset that <unk> <unk> trying to calm investors after the plunge said that investors would simply have to get used to the market big price swings
the <unk> <unk> is partly to blame for the price swings because they cowards said <unk> <unk>
their powerful members manage them
the focus of the outcry has been stock - index arbitrage which accounts for about half the program trading that goes on
index arbitragers argue that their trading is healthy because it links markets but critics say n such trading accelerates market movements and increases the chance for a crash
the <unk> <unk> has refused to be drawn into a public debate about program trading
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> president last week said only that the exchange is concerned about all its constituents
privately exchange officials worry that without a hospitable system for program trading at the <unk> <unk> billions of dollars in trading will simply migrate to overseas exchanges such as <unk>
it is partly for this reason that the exchange last week began trading in its own stock basket product that allows big investors to buy or sell all <unk> stocks in the <unk> <unk> index in a single trade
one intended customer of the new basket product is index arbitragers according to the exchange
investors have complained for some time about program trading particularly index arbitrage to little avail
but according to some <unk> <unk> traders an organized campaign from exchange - listed companies might make the exchange finally consider big changes
they wo n't fight the listed companies
now the assault is on said one top trader
the <unk> <unk> ca n't ban stock - index futures of course but it could ban use of its high - speed electronic trading system for program trading or at least encourage securities firms to back off
the exchange put a bit of a damper on program trading when last year it simply started to publish monthly statistics of each firm program - trading volume
<unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> the group of <unk> <unk> companies is n't ready to go public yet with its effort and that he does n't plan to be the leader once it is public
however he said n he planned to spend the weekend making calls to gather additional support
among those <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> he has been talking to are <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> which is the parent of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
none of these chief executives were available for comment
among the targets of the <unk> <unk> companies campaign will be some corporate pension funds that use program - trading strategies to maximize returns on their investments
for <unk> part the company a month ago informed each of its money managers that it would drop them if they give business to program - trading firms
it was just those kinds of ultimatums that last week succeeded in turning up the heat in the debate
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> services unit said <unk> it cut off <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> unit
all of the firms except <unk> which is the second - biggest program trader on <unk> <unk> quickly announced pull - backs from index arbitrage
<unk> officials stand by their aggressive use of program trading
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said that despite the outcry even by some of <unk> own brokers he believes <unk> index arbitrage does n't have a negative impact on the market as a whole
however pressure on <unk> parent <unk> could change <unk> policy
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has been besieged with phone calls complaining about his unit program trading according to a person close to him
<unk> <unk> instinctive response to the latest upheaval in her government is to promise business as usual
that may be the last thing n she needs
as the air clears from last week storm of resignations and reshufflings the government faces a daunting job of rebuilding confidence in its policies
the prime minister and her new chancellor of the exchequer the untested <unk> <unk> need to haul the country through something like a recession to bring down inflation and set the economy moving again
<unk> <unk> has to come to terms with european economic integration beginning with the <unk> <unk> <unk> which <unk> is committed to joining fully someday
finally the government has to convince a rattled financial community and voters n it is proceeding coherently toward its goals
it sounds like the work of a decade but the deadline is late <unk> when <unk> <unk> is expected to call another national election
what worrying her supporters is that the economic cycle may be out of kilter with the political timetable
she could end up seeking a fourth term in an economy sick with inflation high interest rates and a heavy trade deficit
<unk> <unk> <unk> has pulled through other crises supporters wonder if her steely autocratic ways are the right formula today
there a rising fear that perhaps <unk> <unk> style of management has become a political liability says <unk> <unk> senior economist at <unk> brokers <unk> - <unk> <unk>
the prime minister insistence on keeping a private coterie of advisers including an economic guru who openly criticized former <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> confused the financial community
last week the strategy of playing the two experts off each other blew up <unk> <unk> quit in exasperation and <unk> <unk> <unk> the adviser announced his resignation within an hour
the confusion could be costly
currency traders suspecting <unk> <unk> <unk> wo n't defend the pound strenuously sent the british currency sharply lower <unk> against the dollar and west german mark
analysts expect further jitters this week
a continuing slide in the pound could force the government to push through another rise in the base rate currently n
that could shove a weak economy into recession
economists have been anticipating a slump for months but they now say n it will be deeper and longer than they had thought
<unk> economy is developing rapidly toward no - growth says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> international economist with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>
a mild slowdown probably would have run its course by early n economists say n while the grueling downturn now expected could stretch into <unk>
recovery could be hampered if <unk> major trading partners in <unk> which are enjoying robust economic activity cool off as expected in late <unk> and <unk>
that would leave <unk> <unk> little room for maneuver
for the tories to win the next election voters will need to sense economic improvement for about a year beforehand
<unk> <unk> <unk> does n't need to call an election until <unk> n she would prefer doing so in late <unk>
if the economy shows no sign of turning around in about year time she will be very vulnerable says <unk> <unk> a lecturer at the <unk> <unk> of <unk>
there an equally pressing deadline for the government to define its monetary and economic ties to the rest of the <unk> <unk>
it has sent mixed signals about its willingness to take part in the exchange - rate mechanism of the <unk> <unk> <unk> which links the major <unk> currencies
at a <unk> <unk> summit <unk> <unk> appeared to ease her opposition to full <unk> membership saying n <unk> would join once its inflation rate fell and the <unk> liberalized capital movements
since then the government has left observers wondering if it ever meant to join
<unk> <unk> assailed the monetary arrangement as half - baked in an article being published in an american economics journal
that produced little reaction from his boss reinforcing speculation n the government would use its two conditions as a pretext for avoiding full <unk> membership
despite the departure of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> the tug - of-war over the <unk> could continue
<unk> <unk> <unk> deputy prime minister and a <unk> ally on the <unk> has signaled n he will continue pressing for early membership
of immediate concern is whether the <unk> government will continue <unk> <unk> policy of tracking the monetary policies of the west german <unk> and responding in kind when the <unk> authorities move interest rates
<unk> <unk> does n't like taking orders from foreigners says <unk> <unk> <unk> economist with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
as conservatives rally around <unk> <unk> during the crisis many harbor hopes n last week debacle will prompt change
we wo n't have any more of this wayward behavior says <unk> <unk> <unk> a backbench <unk> member of <unk>
the party is fed up with sackings of good people
it an unrealistic expectation
as long as a decade ago <unk> <unk> declared <unk> she did n't want debate in her cabinet she wanted strong government

wives may not benefit when men do
when husbands take on more housework they tend to substitute for chores done by the kids rather than by the wife
<unk> <unk> researchers <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> analyzed a large sample of married women with at least one child at home between the ages of six and n
the women indicated which family member usually did various household chores and the approximate share <unk> each did
not unexpectedly wives whether working or non - working did by far the most about n of the shopping laundry and cooking and about two - thirds of housecleaning washing dishes child care and family paper work
only for yardwork and home maintenance did women do less than half
but the researchers found that while children household tasks eased the mother burden appreciably the husband helping hand appears to lighten the children load almost on a one - for-one basis and to reduce the wife responsibility only modestly
this pattern was particularly evident among more highly educated couples
in these families husbands took on n more chores than in couples with only grammar school education
but the kids with highly educated parents did <unk> less housework than those in less - educated families
it is clear <unk> <unk> says n that most of the effect of increasing education has been to shift who is helping the wife\/mother
her share decreases but only slightly
nursing home patients apt to be private
far fewer elderly nursing home residents bankrupt themselves than was previously believed two recent studies declare n
state governments place very low ceilings on how much property people may own or how much income they may keep if they want welfare help on medical bills
conventional wisdom has long held that anywhere from one - fourth to one - half of all elderly long - term care patients are obliged to spend themselves into poverty before qualifying for <unk> assistance
but separate reports from <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> find that a surprisingly small proportion only about n of residents start out as private payers but spend down to <unk> levels in a single nursing home stay before they die or are discharged
another one - third are already on <unk> when they enter the nursing homes a considerably higher proportion than the analysts anticipated
but a remarkably high percentage over half are private payers throughout their stay even a fairly lengthy one
about one - third pay out of their own pockets while the rest are covered throughout by <unk> private insurers or the veterans <unk>
both reports are based on several thousand patients sampled in a n nationwide government survey
the <unk> and <unk> <unk> authors caution however that most nursing home stays are of comparatively short duration and reaching the <unk> level is more likely with an unusually long stay or repeated stays
moreover they note n those who manage to pay their own way often do so only by selling their homes using up life savings or drawing heavily on children and other relatives
<unk> era <unk> hold liberal
the <unk> generation young men and women reaching political maturity during <unk> <unk> presidency are firmly liberal on race and gender according to <unk> the social science research center at the <unk> of <unk>
many political analysts have speculated that the <unk> years would produce a staunchly conservative younger generation
norc most recent opinion surveys find the youngest adults indeed somewhat more pro - <unk> and pro - <unk> than other adults
but says n chief investigator <unk> <unk> this does not translate into support for conservatism in general or into conservative positions on feminist and civil rights issues
answers to a dozen questions in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> national surveys reveal that men and women in the <unk> to n age bracket are considerably more liberal on race and gender than were the <unk> to <unk> year olds in <unk> polling in the early n and early n
they were also as liberal or more liberal than any other age group in the <unk> through n surveys
for example n of the <unk> to <unk> year olds in the four latest surveys favored an open housing law prohibiting homeowners from refusing on racial grounds to sell to prospective buyers
that compares with n of the similar age group in the <unk> through n surveys and n in the <unk> through n surveys

<unk> was an edgy month for the practitioners of glasnost the official soviet policy of allowing more candor from the nation media
for one of the superstars of glasnost <unk> <unk> editor of the trail - blazing weekly <unk> <unk> <unk> n was a somersaulting day that turned from tension to elation
he had been summoned to the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> after he finished his lunch at the <unk> <unk> an unlikely prelude to a bureaucratic brow - beating eight - foot-tall rubenesquely naked ladies float on their canvases toward a ceiling teeming with cherubs all surrounded by gilt laid on with a pastry chef trowel and supported by marble corinthian columns whose capitals are fluting fountains of gold
why had <unk> <unk> been called
i told my driver he said that he was taking my butt to the <unk> <unk> so they can whack whack whack his hand made vigorous spanking gestures on his left palm
they feel the need from time to time to educate me
and indeed as he later reported that was the import of the meeting
anxious allies of <unk> <unk> <unk> are cautioning media leaders to take it easy to be careful not to do anything that could be used by <unk> <unk> opponents
the government is nervous
according to <unk> <unk> who was present <unk> <unk> publicized tongue - lashing of the press on <unk> n was more of a plea be careful boys use good judgment

<unk> and northern european diplomats confirm <unk> <unk> assessment that glasnost is in no immediate danger
in fact a very high - ranking soviet official told an american official at a diplomatic dinner that no change in the policy was contemplated
the day after that conversation at the residence of the <unk> ambassador the <unk> editor of <unk> <unk> <unk> was replaced by a college classmate of <unk> <unk>
<unk> holdovers have more n to fear from <unk> <unk> than the verbal spanking n he gave to the press
at the end of the very week in which <unk> <unk> was called to the <unk> <unk> <unk> was again demonstrating its independence by printing a poll that showed that <unk> of the soviet population a plurality believed that <unk> <unk> economic reforms perestroika would result in only insignificant change
a good measurement of the popularity of ice - breaker journals like <unk> is circulation
when <unk> <unk> took it over in <unk> it sold <unk> copies today it sells n million
<unk> meanwhile has retained only n of its <unk> readership
glasnost has made celebrities of men like <unk> <unk>
prevented by the <unk> <unk> from getting on its slate of nominees for the new <unk> <unk> he stood as an independent candidate for <unk> from his native <unk> and won with n of the vote
the same evening that he was summoned for a warning from the <unk> he was cheered by thousands of his supporters at a rally of what can only be called the <unk> party
but as astounding as the changes that have already occurred are there is a fragility to glasnost
censorship is n't a marxist invention
the czars were no civil libertarians
as late as the <unk> the russian government prevented any coverage of famines
it even directed newspapers not to publish anything that might stain the honor of the turkish sultan wives
so glasnost is not a value woven with steel threads into the fabric of russian society
it is an admirable public relations program initiated by a single political leader during a four - year blink of history
it is public relations of the highest sophistication that recognizes that credibility is enhanced by honesty up to a point
what is that point
will <unk> begin a series of reports analyzing the failures of perestroika
i be destroying myself replies <unk> <unk> who then asks what would that accomplish
his answer reveals his vulnerability it also draws the line that soviet society must cross to enter the normal dialogue of western culture
it is the line beyond which the press can report not only on the bankruptcy of factories but on the failures of even admirable leaders
<unk> <unk> is editor and publisher of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
a state trial judge in <unk> gave preliminary approval to a proposed settlement of a suit against a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> unit <unk> <unk> <unk> over the interest rates on <unk> former one <unk> <unk> <unk> money - market deposit accounts
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> also recognized the suit filed last <unk> by <unk> and <unk> <unk> as a class action covering thousands of <unk> customers
the plaintiffs accused <unk> of paying less interest than promised in a marketing brochure
<unk> maintained and still does that its actions were proper under its account agreements with customers
under the proposed settlement customers with valid claims n to be submitted by <unk> <unk> will receive valuable bank services such as credit cards with reduced finance charges for two years
<unk> <unk> attorney for the plaintiffs valued the settlement at between n million and n million
a <unk> of <unk> <unk> spokesman in <unk> <unk> <unk> said that the maximum outside figure
<unk> <unk> critics used to complain of stop and go monetary policies
they claimed that the <unk> would first give a green light to the economy by making credit readily available and then turn on the red and bring growth to a screeching halt
but under <unk> <unk> that has changed
a supremely cautious man the <unk> chairman is forever blinking yellow
indeed his caution has become legendary within the government
he fusses endlessly over economic statistics dissecting them in dozens of ways probing for hours in search of potential problems
after thoroughly digesting reams of information he often concludes that more data are needed and when he finally decides to act his movements sometimes seem excrutiatingly small
such caution was evident after the recent <unk> stock market plunge
some <unk> administration officials urged <unk> <unk> to make an immediate public announcement of his plans to provide ample credit to the markets
but he refused claiming that he wanted to see what happened <unk> morning before making any public statement
<unk> <unk> decision to keep quiet also prompted a near - mutiny within the <unk> ranks
a senior <unk> official spoke on <unk> after the market swoon to both the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> saying n the <unk> was prepared to provide as much credit as the markets needed
the statement angered <unk> <unk> but it was greeted with applause by the <unk> administration and the financial markets
and while the mutinous <unk> member has n't gone public some <unk> governors most notably <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are known to have disagreed with the chairman decision to remain silent
ironically the anonymous official comments have earned some plaudits for <unk> <unk> who is mistakenly seen as the source
at a hearing last week democratic <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> told <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> announcement over the <unk> n weekend was a very important statement
<unk> <unk> hesitantly replied that he was n't sure whether <unk> <unk> made a statement himself or whether that was a newspaper report
the <unk> chairman caution was apparent again on the <unk> morning after the market plunge when the central bank took only modest steps n to aid the markets
a surprisingly small amount of reserves was added to the banking system
and by the end of that week the key federal funds interest rate which is largely controlled by the <unk> had settled at n barely changed from the level of just under <unk> that prevailed the previous week
<unk> administration officials appear increasingly concerned that <unk> <unk> is cautious to a fault
signs of growing weakness in the economy paired with indications that inflation is staying well under control have caused them to wonder why the <unk> chairman is so grudging in reducing rates
those concerns are n't expressed in public
in fact the administration and the <unk> have been going out of their way in the past two weeks to dispel any impression that they are at odds fearing <unk> stories about an administration - <unk> split added to the stock market jitters
still the split is there
the administration concerns are understandable
the economy is showing signs of weakness particularly among manufacturers
exports which played a key role in fueling growth over the last two years seem to have stalled
factory payrolls and production fell in <unk> and the auto industry and housing are in a severe crunch
but <unk> <unk> remains reluctant to loosen policy partly because he faces a phalanx of presidents of regional <unk> banks who oppose credit easing
in addition the chairman has a wary eye aimed a year or two down the road
inflation may be stable at the moment running at about <unk>
but if the <unk> eases too soon <unk> <unk> fears n prices may begin to accelerate again next year
moreover if the <unk> holds tight it may be able gradually to reduce inflation moving toward the zero - inflation goal that the <unk> chairman embraced in testimony to <unk> last week
so far <unk> <unk> cautious approach to policy has served both him and the nation well
his hand on the monetary tiller seems one reason why the economy next month seems highly likely to begin an unprecedented eighth year of peacetime growth without a recession
we gotten through two stock market crashes and we gone through an election without any major problems says <unk> <unk> an economist of <unk> <unk> services
i think n you have to give <unk> a good rating
but such caution is no guarantee against mistakes
the <unk> reluctance to ease credit now could be laying the groundwork for a new recession perhaps starting early next year
if that happens <unk> <unk> could well become an open target
already <unk> is toying with legislation n to curb the <unk> independence
if the economy turns down such proposals could gain strong momentum
the following issues were recently filed with the securities and <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> initial offering of n million shares of which <unk> will sell n and co - founders will sell n shares via <unk> <unk>

in an age of specialization the federal judiciary is one of the last bastions of the generalist
a judge must jump from murder to antitrust cases from arson to securities fraud without missing a beat
but even on the federal bench specialization is creeping in and it has become a subject of sharp controversy on the newest federal appeals court
the <unk> of appeals for the <unk> <unk> was created in <unk> to serve among other things as the court of last resort for most patent disputes
previously patent cases moved through the court system to one of the <unk> circuit appeals courts
there judges who saw few such cases and had no experience in the field grappled with some of the most technical and complex disputes imaginable
a new specialty court was sought by patent experts who believed that the generalists had botched too many important multimillion - dollar cases
some patent lawyers had hoped that such a specialty court would be filled with experts in the field
but the <unk> administration thought otherwise and so may the <unk> administration
since <unk> the president has filled four vacancies in the <unk> <unk> court with non - patent lawyers
now only three of the <unk> judges <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> have patent - law backgrounds
the latter two and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are approaching senior status or retirement
three seats currently are vacant and three others are likely to be filled within a few years so patent lawyers and research - based industries are making a new push for specialists <unk> to be added to the court
several organizations including the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> manufacturers <unk> have asked the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to name candidates with both patent and scientific backgrounds
the associations would like the court to include between three and six judges with specialized training
some of the associations have recommended <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a former patent agent with a doctorate in organic chemistry who now is associate general counsel with <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>
<unk> <unk> says <unk> the <unk> <unk> interviewed him last <unk>
their effort has received a lukewarm response from the <unk> <unk>
we do not feel that seats are reserved for patent lawyers says <unk> spokesman <unk> <unk> who declines to say how soon a candidate will be named
but we will take it into consideration
the <unk> <unk> view is shared by other lawyers and at least one member of the court <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a former civil litigator who served at the claims court trial level before he was appointed to the <unk> <unk> two years ago
i believe that any good lawyer should be able to figure out and understand patent law <unk> <unk> says adding that it the responsibility of highly paid lawyers who argue before the court to make us understand complex patent litigation
yet some lawyers point to <unk> <unk> <unk> vs. <unk> <unk> the patent infringement case n the <unk> <unk> this month agreed to review as an example of poor legal reasoning by judges who lack patent litigation experience
<unk> <unk> was not on the three - member panel
in the <unk> case the appeals court broadly construed a federal statute to grant <unk> a medical device manufacturer an exemption n to infringe a patent under certain circumstances
if the <unk> <unk> holds in <unk> favor the decision will have billion - dollar consequences for the manufacturers of medical devices color and food additives and all other non - drug products that required <unk> <unk> <unk> approval
<unk> <unk> a lawyer and director of government relations for the <unk> <unk> <unk> contends that a judge well - versed in patent law and the concerns of research - based industries would have ruled otherwise
and <unk> <unk> a former patent lawyer wrote in her dissent when the court denied a motion for a rehearing of the case by the full court the panel judicial legislation has affected an important high - technological industry without regard to the consequences for research and innovation or the public interest
says <unk> <unk> the judgment confirms our concern that the absence of patent lawyers on the court could prove troublesome

<unk> <unk> <unk> is trying to struggle back
only a few months ago the n securities firm seemed to be on the verge of a meltdown racked by internal squabbles and defections
its relationship with parent <unk> <unk> <unk> had been frayed since a big <unk> insider - trading scandal two years ago
chief executives and presidents had come and gone
now the firm says n it at a turning point
by the end of this year n <unk> <unk> <unk> the former chairman of <unk> <unk> <unk> who was derided as a tool - and-die man when <unk> brought him in to clean up <unk> in <unk> retires to his <unk> <unk> <unk> home possibly to build a shopping mall on some land n he owns
i done what i came to do at <unk> he says n
and that means <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> president and chief executive since <unk> will for the first time take complete control of <unk> and try to make good on some grandiose plans
<unk> <unk> says <unk> he will return <unk> to prominence as a great investment bank
<unk> <unk> is understandably skeptical
through the first nine months of the year <unk> ranks a distant n among underwriters of <unk> stocks and bonds with a n market share up slightly from <unk> in the year - earlier period according to <unk> <unk> <unk>
it quite a fall from the early n when <unk> still was counted as an investment - banking powerhouse
<unk> <unk> <unk> president of the <unk> <unk> an executive search firm said i like to see <unk> succeed
but they have to attract good senior bankers who can bring in the business from day one
in <unk> <unk> eked out a n million profit mainly because of severe cost cutting
its n brokerage operation reported an estimated n million loss last year although <unk> expects it to turn a profit this year
in fact <unk> is a minor player in just about every business n it does except computer - driven program trading in that controversial business only <unk> <unk> <unk> rivals <unk>
but even that niche is under attack as several <unk> <unk> firms pulled back from program trading last week under pressure from big investors
<unk> <unk> a former consulting - firm executive who has a love for task forces says <unk> he has done a complete rethink of <unk> in recent months
there have been a dizzying parade of studies of the firm operations
more than n new managing directors and senior vice presidents have been hired since <unk>
the firm brokerage force has been trimmed and its mergers - and-acquisitions staff increased to a record n people
<unk> <unk> says that when he assumes full control <unk> will finally tap the resources of <unk>
one of <unk> goals when it bought <unk> of <unk> in <unk> was to take advantage of syngeries between <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> corporate - finance unit which has n billion in assets
the leveraged buy - out group of <unk> <unk> now reports to <unk> <unk>
so far instead of teaming up <unk> <unk> staffers and <unk> investment bankers have bickered
yet says <unk> <unk> <unk> we really started to exploit the synergy between <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
the units have worked on <unk> investment banking deals this year he says n though not all of them have panned out
we had a good relationship with <unk> which is the first time n you could say that uh let me withdraw that
it been a steadily improving relationship says <unk> <unk>
still without many actual deals n to show off <unk> is left to stress that it finally has a team in place and that everyone works harder
a month ago the firm started serving dinner at about n each night about <unk> to n of the <unk> people in the investment banking operation have consistently been around that late
we are working significantly longer and harder than has been the case in the past says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> head of investment banking since <unk>
everywhere <unk> stresses the always working theme
a new in - house magazine <unk> <unk> which will focus on the firm synergy strategy says <unk> <unk> <unk> confides that on weekends <unk> <unk> often gets value - added ideas while flying his single - engine <unk> <unk> on the way to <unk>
the firm new head of mergers and acquisitions under <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> talks of the opportunity to rebuild a franchise at <unk>
the <unk> name is one of only six or seven that every ceo recognizes as a viable alternative when considering a merger deal he says
now according to a <unk> <unk> story about <unk> <unk> all <unk> the firm has to do is position ourselves more in the deal flow
with investment banking as <unk> lead business where do <unk> <unk> brokerage network and its <unk> brokers fit in
<unk> <unk> this month sold off <unk> eight brokerage offices in <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> refueling speculation that <unk> is getting out of the brokerage business entirely
<unk> <unk> denies the speculation
to answer the brokerage question <unk> in typical fashion completed a task - force study
the result <unk> will focus on rich individual investors and small companies much closer to the clientele of <unk> <unk> <unk> than a serve - the-world firm like <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> notes that these types of investors also are sophisticated enough not to complain about <unk> aggressive use of program trading
as part of the upscale push <unk> is putting brokers through a n training course turning them into investment counselors with knowledge of corporate finance
they will get new and improved tools n to sell particularly to the affluent investor says brokerage chief <unk> <unk> <unk>
theoretically the brokers will then be able to funnel leads on corporate finance opportunities to <unk> investment bankers possibly easing the longstanding tension between the two camps
however skeptics caution that this kind of cross - pollination between brokers and investment bankers looks great on paper but does n't always happen
<unk> competitors are n't outwardly hostile to the firm as many are to a tough competitor like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that does n't have <unk> long history
however competitors say that <unk> hiring binge involving executive - level staffers some with multiple - year contract guarantees could backfire unless there are results
the departing <unk> <unk> says <unk> he has no worries about <unk> future
<unk> <unk> who will return to the <unk> <unk> <unk> board of directors in addition to his personal ventures is credited with bringing some basic budgeting and planning discipline to traditionally free - wheeling <unk>
he also improved the firm compliance procedures for trading
<unk> <unk> says <unk> he has had a lot of fun at <unk> adding n the crack about his being a tool - and-die man never bothered him
it was an absolutely marvelous line and one n i used many times he says
smiling broadly when he talks about <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> says <unk> the new <unk> chief is going to be recognized shortly as one of the real leaders in the investment - banking business
in coming years <unk> <unk> says <unk> <unk> is gon na hum
or as <unk> <unk> again drawing on his consulting - firm background puts it we ready to implement at this point
under a proposal by democrats to expand <unk> <unk> accounts a n contribution by a taxpayer in the n bracket would save n on his taxes
the savings was given incorrectly in <unk> edition
in what could prove a major addition to the philippines foreign - investment portfolio a taiwanese company signed a n million construction contract to build the centerpiece of a planned petrochemical complex
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a petrochemical company initialed the agreement with an unidentified japanese contractor to build a naphtha cracker according to <unk> <unk> who heads the philippine company set up to build and operate the complex
<unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> the contract was signed <unk> in <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> officials
contract details however have n't been made public
the complex is to be located in <unk> about <unk> miles south of <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> will hold a <unk> stake in <unk> <unk> according to papers signed with the philippine government <unk> of <unk>
the proposed petrochemical plant would use naphtha to manufacture the petrochemicals propylene and ethylene and their resin derivatives polypropylene and polyethylene
these are the raw materials used in making plastics
the contract signing represented a major step in the long - planned petrochemical project
at an estimated n million the project would represent the single largest foreign investment in the philippines since <unk> <unk> <unk> took office in <unk> n
it also is considered critical to the country efforts to both attract other investment from <unk> and raise heavy industry capabilities
the project has been in and out of the pipeline for more than a decade
however workers ca n't break ground until legal maneuvers to block the complex are resolved moves which caused the signing to remain questionable up to the last moment
as previously reported a member of the <unk> <unk> of representatives has sued to stop the plant
the legislator <unk> <unk> had actively backed the plant but at the original site in his constituency northwest of <unk>
the country <unk> <unk> dismissed the suit but <unk> <unk> late last month filed for a reconsideration
in addition <unk> <unk> has yet to sign into law a bill removing a stiff n tax on naphtha the principal raw material n to be used in the cracker
however at a news conference <unk> <unk> <unk> backed the project and said n her government was attempting to soothe the feelings of residents at the original site adjacent to the government major petroleum refinery in <unk> province
we have tried our best to tell the people in <unk> that maybe this time it will not go to them but certainly we will do our best to encourage other investors to go to their province <unk> <unk> told <unk> - based foreign correspondents
the project appeared to be on the rocks earlier this month when the other major partner in the project <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> backed out
<unk> <unk> plastics another taiwanese petrochemical manufacturer was to have a <unk> stake in <unk> <unk>
however <unk> <unk> said that <unk> <unk> <unk> is confident <unk> other investors will take up the slack
he said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has applied to both the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for financing that could include equity stakes

in <unk> edition it was incorrectly indicated that the union had paid a fee to former <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> insists <unk> it would be a great tool for curbing the budget deficit and slicing the lard out of government programs
he wants it now
not so fast says <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> a fellow <unk>
i consider it one of the stupidest ideas of the <unk> century he says
it the line - item veto a procedure that would allow the president to kill individual items in a big spending bill passed by <unk> without vetoing the entire bill
whatever one thinks of the idea it far more than the budgetary gimmick n it may seem at first glance
rather it a device that could send shock waves through the president entire relationship with democrats and republicans alike in <unk> fundamentally enhance the power of the presidency and transform the way n the government does its business
<unk> <unk> badly wants a line - item veto and has long called for a law giving it to the president
now the <unk> <unk> is declaring that he might not rely on <unk> which has n't shown any willingness to surrender such authority to pass the line - item veto law n he seeks
<unk> <unk> spokesmen last week said <unk> <unk> <unk> is considering simply declaring that the <unk> gives him the power exercising a line - item veto and inviting a court challenge n to decide whether he has the right
although that may sound like an arcane maneuver of little interest outside <unk> it would set off a political earthquake
the ramifications are enormous says <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> who is a senior member of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
it a real face - to-face arm wrestling challenge to <unk>
<unk> <unk> aides know n it a step that ca n't be taken lightly and for that reason the president may back down from launching a test case this year
some senior advisers argue that with further fights over a capital - gains tax cut and a budget - reduction bill looming <unk> <unk> already has enough pending confrontations with <unk>
they prefer to put off the line - item veto until at least next year
still <unk> <unk> and some other aides are strongly drawn to the idea of trying out a line - item veto
the issue arose last week when <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> told an audience in <unk> that <unk> <unk> was looking for a test case
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> confirmed that <unk> <unk> was interested in the idea but cautioned that there was n't a firm decision to try it
<unk> <unk> former <unk> <unk> and a host of conservative activists have been arguing that a line - item veto would go a long way in restoring discipline to the budget process
they maintain that a president needs the ability to surgically remove pork - barrel spending projects that are attached to big omnibus spending bills
those bills ca n't easily be vetoed in their entirety because they often are needed to keep the government operating
conservatives note that <unk> governors have the line - item veto n to use on state budgets
more provocatively some conservative legal theorists have begun arguing that <unk> <unk> does n't need to wait for a law giving him the veto because the power already is implicit in the <unk>
they base their argument on a clause buried in article i <unk> <unk> of the <unk> that states every order resolution or vote to which the concurrence of the <unk> and <unk> of representatives may be necessary except on a question of adjournment shall be presented to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and before the same shall take effect shall be approved by him or disapproved by him
this clause they argue <unk> is designed to go beyond an earlier clause specifying that the president can veto a bill and is broad enough to allow him to strike out items and riders within bills
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for one accepts this argument and earlier this year publicly urged <unk> <unk> to use the line - item veto and allow the courts to decide whether or not it is constitutional
there little doubt that such a move would be immediately challenged in court and that it would quickly make its way to the <unk> <unk> to be ultimately resolved
it a major issue and they would n't want to leave it at a lower level says <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> attorney whose writings have been instrumental in pushing the idea that a president already has a line - item veto
<unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> is one who pledges that he would immediately challenge <unk> <unk> in the courts arguing n a line - item veto would expand a president powers far beyond anything n the framers of the <unk> had in mind
it puts this president in the legislative business he declares
that not what our fathers had in mind
in addition to giving a president powers to rewrite spending bills meant to be written in <unk> <unk> <unk> argues <unk> a line - item veto would allow the chief executive to blackmail lawmakers
he notes that as a lawmaker from the <unk> <unk> area he fights each year to preserve federal funds for the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> system
if a president had a line - item veto and wanted to force him to support a controversial foreign - policy initiative <unk> <unk> says n the president could call and declare that he would single - handedly kill the <unk> funds unless the congressman shapes up on the foreign - policy issue
proponents maintain that a president would choose to use a line - item veto more judiciously than that
but there may be another problem with the device despite all the political angst n it would cause it might n't be effective in cutting the deficit
big chunks of the government budget like the entitlement programs of <unk> <unk> and <unk> would n't be affected
governors have found that they have to use the device sparingly to maintain political comity
and it is n't even clear that some pork - barrel projects can be hit with a line - item veto because they tend to be listed in informal conference reports accompanying spending bills rather than in the official bills themselves
still proponents contend that the veto would have what <unk> <unk> calls an important chilling effect on all manner of appropriations bills
lawmakers they say n would avoid putting many spending projects into legislation in the first place for fear of the embarrassment of having them singled out for a line - item veto later
whatever the outcome of a test case <unk> <unk> would have to move cautiously becase the very attempt would antagonize not just democrats but republicans says <unk> <unk> a scholar at the <unk> <unk> <unk> who specializes in executive - legislative relations
republicans have as much interest as democrats in the way n the system works he notes n
indeed although a majority of republican lawmakers favor a line - item veto some ranging from liberal <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to conservative <unk> <unk> are opposed
<unk> <unk> voices the traditional conservative view that it a mistake to put too much power in the hands of a single person
conservatives pushing for a line - item veto now he notes n may regret it later sometime you going to have a democratic president again who use his expanded powers against those very same conservatives
every order resolution or vote to which the concurrence of the <unk> and <unk> of representatives may be necessary except on a question of adjournment shall be presented to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and before the same shall take effect shall be approved by him or being disapproved by him shall be repassed by two - thirds of the <unk> and <unk> of representatives according to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill

a company spokesman said n it was possible but highly unlikely that the plant might never be built
as we regain our leadership level where we have been and as we continue to put new products into the marketplace and need additional capacity we will look at resuming our involvement with our plan he said

federal prosecutors are concluding fewer criminal cases with trials

the discrepancy is somewhat perplexing in that the <unk> researchers said n they based their conclusions on government statistics

in its report to <unk> on international economic policies the <unk> said that any improvement in the broadest measure of trade known as the current account is likely at best to be very modest and the possibility of deterioration in the current account next year can not be excluded
the statement was the <unk> government first acknowledgement of what other groups such as the <unk> <unk> <unk> have been predicting for months
continued strength in the dollar was cited as one reason n the trade position may deteriorate
the <unk> report which is required annually by a provision of the <unk> trade act again took <unk> <unk> to task for its exchange - rate policies
we believe that there have continued to be indications of exchange - rate manipulation during the past six months it said <unk> citing the lack of market forces in <unk> <unk> exchange - rate system and the use of capital and interest - rate controls to manipulate exchange rates
the <unk> expressed pleasure however with the government of <unk> which was cited for exchange - rate manipulation in last year report

<unk> <unk> reached an agreement with its creditor banks that is expected to cut that government n billion in bank debt by as much as <unk>
the agreement was announced by costa rican <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and other leaders from the <unk> <unk> gathered in the central american nation for a celebration of democracy
<unk> <unk> had been negotiating with the <unk> and other banks for three years but the debt plan was rushed to completion in order to be announced at the meeting
the government had fallen n million behind in interest payments
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> called the agreement an important step forward in the strengthened debt strategy noting that it will when implemented provide significant reduction in the level of debt and debt service owed by <unk> <unk>
under the plan <unk> <unk> will buy back roughly n of its bank debt outstanding at a deeply discounted price according to officials involved in the agreement
the remainder of the debt will be exchanged for new costa rican bonds with a <unk> n interest rate
the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> are expected to provide approximately n million to help support the deal and additional funds are expected from <unk>
<unk> officials say n the costa rican agreement demonstrates that the <unk> debt plan can benefit small debtor countries as well as big debtors such as <unk>
the <unk> said n it plans to sell n billion of n cash - management bills today raising all new cash
the bills will be dated <unk> n and will mature <unk> n
no non - competitive tenders will be accepted
tenders available in minimum denominations of n million must be received by noon <unk> today at <unk> <unk> banks or branches
the <unk> also announced details of this week unusual bill auction which has been changed to accommodate the expiration of the federal debt ceiling at midnight tomorrow
the <unk> and <unk> bills will be issued tomorrow rather than <unk> <unk> n as originally planned
the three - month bills will still mature <unk> n <unk> and the six - month bills on <unk> <unk> <unk>
the <unk> also said <unk> noncompetitive tenders will be considered timely if postmarked no later than <unk> <unk> n and received no later than tomorrow
the <unk> said <unk> it wo n't be able to honor reinvestment requests from holders of bills maturing <unk> n held in the <unk> book - entry system
the department will make payment for bills maturing on <unk> n to all investors who have requested reinvestment of their bills on that date as well as to all account holders who have previously requested payment
<unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> it agreed in principle to sell its <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> subsidiary to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . for n million
<unk> <unk> parent of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> the sale will add capital and reduce the level of investments in subsidiaries for the thrift holding company
recently the boards of both the parent company and the thrift also voted to suspend dividends on preferred shares of both companies and convert all preferred into common shares
the company said n the move was necessary to meet capital requirements
the transaction is subject to execution of a definitive purchase agreement and approval by various regulatory agencies including the insurance departments of the states of <unk> and <unk> the company said n
in the second quarter <unk> <unk> reported a loss of n million compared with net income of n million a year earlier
the banking operation had a loss of n million in the second quarter largely because of problem real - estate loans while the insurance operations earned n
<unk> employment data also could turn out to be the most confusing
on the surface the overall unemployment rate is expected to be little changed from <unk> n
but the actual head count of non - farm employment payroll jobs is likely to be muddied by the impact of <unk> <unk> strikes and less - than-perfect seasonal adjustments economists said n
the consensus view calls for an overall job gain of <unk> compared with <unk> n increase
but the important factory - jobs segment which last month plunged by n positions and raised recession fears is most likely to be skewed by the month unusual events
several other reports come before <unk> jobs data including the <unk> leading indicators index new - home sales and <unk> agricultural prices reports due out tomorrow the <unk> purchasing managers index and <unk> construction spending and manufacturers orders on <unk> and <unk> chain - store sales on <unk>
<unk> brings the final count on <unk> auto sales
the employment report is going to be difficult n to interpret said <unk> <unk> economist with <unk> <unk> a unit of <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> added that next month data is n't likely to be much better because it will be distorted by <unk> <unk> earthquake
what more he believes n seasonal swings in the auto industry this year are n't occurring at the same time as in the past because of production and pricing differences that are curbing the accuracy of seasonal adjustments built into the employment data
<unk> report from the purchasing agents will be watched to see if the index maintains a level below n as it has for the past couple of months
a reading of less than <unk> indicates an economy that is generally contracting while a reading above <unk> indicates an economy that expanding
<unk> <unk> <unk> chief financial economist at <unk> <unk> <unk> securities <unk> <unk> said that the purchasers report is valuable because it often presents the first inkling of economic data for the month
but he added some people use the purchasers index as a leading indicator some use it as a coincident indicator
but the thing n it supposed to measure manufacturing strength it missed altogether last month
<unk> <unk> chief financial economist at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said that the purchasers index does miss occasionally adding when it misses one month it tends to miss the next month too
the consensus view on <unk> leading indicators calls for a gain of <unk> the same as in <unk>
economists said <unk> greatly increased consumer optimism a larger money supply and higher stock prices helped lift the index
all orders - related components such as consumer - goods orders and building permits are thought to have been weaker
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> added that he will be keeping a closer eye than ususal on <unk> chain - store sales
usually <unk> is n't a very interesting month for retail figures because school clothes have been bought and people are waiting for <unk> to buy <unk> presents he said n
but <unk> <unk> said <unk> he will watch the numbers to get an inkling of whether consumers general buying habits may slack off as much as their auto - buying apparently has
he noted that higher gasoline prices will help buoy the <unk> totals
seasonal factors are also expected to have taken their toll on <unk> new - home sales which are believed to have fallen sharply from <unk> <unk> units
construction spending is believed to have slipped about <unk> from <unk> levels although economists noted n the rate probably will pick up in the months ahead in response to hurricane and earthquake damage
factory owners are buying new machinery at a good rate this fall machine tool makers say <unk> but sluggish sales of new cars and trucks raise questions about fourth - quarter demand from the important automotive industry
<unk> orders for machine tools rebounded from the summer doldrums but remained n below year - earlier levels according to figures from <unk> the <unk> for <unk> <unk>
domestic machine tool plants received n million of orders last month up n from <unk> n million but still below the n million of <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk>
machine tools are complex machines ranging from lathes to metal - forming presses that are used to shape most metal parts
overall demand still is very respectable says <unk> <unk> <unk> group vice president at <unk> <unk> <unk> the nation largest machine tool producer
the outlook is positive for the intermediate to long term
<unk> orders for all <unk> producers in fact were slightly above the monthly average for <unk> a good year for the industry
aerospace orders are very good <unk> <unk> says
and export business is still good
while some automotive programs have been delayed they have n't been canceled
<unk> was one of the biggest order months in our history says <unk> <unk> <unk> vice president world - wide sales and marketing for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
at a recent meeting of manufacturing executives everybody n i talked with was very positive he says n
most say n they plan to spend more on factory equipment in <unk> than in <unk>
but sales of <unk> <unk> - made n cars are running at an annual rate of only six million down from n million a year earlier
and truck sales also are off more than n
auto makers who began deferring some equipment purchases last spring can be expected to remain cautious about spending if their sales do n't pick up machine tool builders say <unk>
machine tool executives are hopeful however that recent developments in <unk> <unk> will expand markets for u.s.-made machine tools in that region
there is demand for state - of-the-art machine tools in the <unk> <unk> and in other eastern european countries as those nations strive to improve the efficiency of their ailing factories as well as the quality of their goods
however there a continuing dispute between machine tool makers and the <unk> <unk> over whether sophisticated <unk> machine tools would increase the <unk> <unk> military might
the <unk> <unk> says go and the <unk> <unk> says stop complains one machine tool producer
if that controversy continues <unk> machine tool makers say n west german and other foreign producers are likely to grab most of the sales in <unk> <unk>
<unk> orders for machining centers lathes milling machines grinders boring mills and other machines that shape metal by cutting totaled n million down <unk> from n million a year earlier but a <unk> increase from <unk> n million <unk> said <unk>
orders last month for metal - forming presses and other machinery n to form metal with pressure surged to n million a <unk> rise from n million a year earlier and a <unk> gain from n million in <unk>
today presses are large and costly machines and a few orders can produce a high total for one month that does n't necessarily indicate a trend
machine tool shipments last month were n million a <unk> rise from a year earlier and a <unk> increase from <unk>
shipments have run well ahead of <unk> all year as machine tool builders produce against relatively good backlogs
<unk> producers had a n billion backlog of unfilled orders at the end of <unk>
that was up n from a year earlier even though orders for the first nine months of n were down n from the comparable n period

in <unk> stock market circles the buzzword is mega
at least n companies are coming to the capital market to raise n billion an amount never thought possible in <unk>
when they talk mega - issues they truly talking mega says <unk> <unk> chairman of the securities and <unk> <unk> of <unk>
the capital market is booming
but the mega - issues are raising megaquestions about the rapidly evolving indian capital market
one is whether there is enough money to fund the new issues without depressing stock trading
moreover in the relatively unregulated indian stock markets investors frequently do n't know what they are getting when they subscribe to an issue
a prospectus in <unk> does n't always tell a potential investor much
some of the large amounts are being raised by small firms
in addition once money is raised investors usually have no way of knowing how it is spent
some analysts are concerned that the mega - issues in such an unregulated environment could lead to a mega - crash
the rate of failures will be much more than the rate of successes in the mega - projects says <unk> <unk> a former chairman of the giant government - run mutual fund the <unk> <unk> of <unk>
they going to have mega - problems
the indian stock markets have been on a five - year high with dips and corrections since <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> started liberalizing industry
but the last stock market boom in <unk> seems small compared with the current rush to market
the n billion that some n companies are looking to raise in the year ending <unk> <unk> compares with only n billion raised on the capital market in the previous fiscal year
in fiscal <unk> before <unk> <unk> came to power only n million was raised
this year biggest issue n million of convertible debentures by engineering company <unk> <unk> <unk> is the largest in indian history
and it is n't the only giant issue together the top four issues will raise n billion
convertible debentures bonds that can later be converted into equity shares are the most popular instrument this year though many companies are also selling nonconvertible bonds or equity shares
these mega - issues are being propelled by two factors economic and political
in the past the socialist policies of the government strictly limited the size of new steel mills petrochemical plants car factories and other industrial concerns to conserve resources and restrict the profits n businessmen could make
as a result industry operated out of small expensive highly inefficient industrial units
when <unk> <unk> came to power he ushered in new rules for business
he said n industry should build plants on the same scale as those outside <unk> and benefit from economies of scale
if the output was too great for the domestic market he said n companies should export
<unk> overregulated businessmen had to be persuaded but they have started to think big
some of the projects being funded by the new issues are the first fruits of <unk> <unk> policy and they require more capital than the smaller industrial units built in the past
the industrial revolution has produced an explosion in the capital market which is a far cheaper source of funds than government - controlled banks where interest rates for prime borrowers are around <unk>
the second factor spurring mega - issues is political
<unk> <unk> has called general elections for <unk> and many businessmen fear that he and his <unk> <unk> <unk> will lose
some companies are raising money in anticipation of a government less predictable than <unk> <unk> and possibly more restrictive
the buoyant <unk> rumor mill also says that some of the money raised in the current spate of issues will be used as campaign donations before the elections
no one admits to anything but <unk> industrialists have a history of making under - the-table campaign donations
so far the mega - issues are a hit with investors
earlier this year <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> offer of n million of convertible debentures was oversubscribed
<unk> <unk> <unk> a marine construction company had similar success with a slightly smaller issue
<unk> <unk> started accepting applications for its giant issue earlier this month bankers and analysts expect it to be oversubscribed
still to come are big issues by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a petrochemical and agrochemical company and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a semiconductor maker
while many investors are selling parts of their portfolios to buy the new issues prices on <unk> n stock exchanges are holding up so far
i do n't think n it will lead to any chaos in the secondary market says <unk> <unk> only a sagging tendency
says <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> the markets are headed for growth unheard of and unseen before
but with growth come growing pains and never has this been clearer on the indian capital market than now
in the past the government controlled the markets indirectly through its tight grip on industry itself
various ministries decided the products n businessmen could produce and how much and government - owned banks controlled the financing of projects and monitored whether companies came through on promised plans
the government has been content with this far - reaching subtle form of control exercised on a case - by-case basis with no clear rules or guidelines
but now with large amounts being raised from investors the government dawdling on regulation and disclosure requirements has a more dangerous aspect
the securities and <unk> <unk> of <unk> was set up earlier this year along the lines of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> but <unk> <unk> has n't pushed the legislation to make it operational
<unk> <unk> its head acts cheery and patient but he makes no bones about the need to get to work
<unk> or non - mega we feel n the prospectus standards need to be considerably improved he says
disclosures are very poor in <unk>
he says <unk> the big questions do you really need this much money to put up these investments have you told investors what is happening in your sector what about your track record are n't asked of companies coming to market
instead he says n most investors have to rely on the rumor - happy indian press
an example is the biggest offering of them all <unk> <unk> <unk> million bond issue
the engineering company was acquired in a takeover earlier this year by the giant <unk> textile group
although <unk> <unk> had n't raised money from the public in n years its new owners frequently raise funds on the local market
<unk> floated a n million petrochemical company in <unk> that was at the time the largest public issue in indian history
the media has raised questions about <unk> <unk> issue pointing out that it exceeds the company annual sales and its market capitalization
even stranger is the case of <unk> <unk> a semiconductor company with n sales of n million that raising n million to build an iron plant
once the money is raised it is n't always certain how it is used
<unk> <unk> for example says it raising n million n to use as supplier credit on large engineering jobs
unlike other companies it has n't pin - pointed specific projects for the funds
and even when specific projects are described in prospectuses the money often is used elsewhere according to analysts
someone must monitor where the funds are deployed says <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> agrees there is no proper monitoring and screening of the use of these funds
they trying to plug the various loopholes but they totally unprepared for this
because of the large amounts of money being raised the loose disclosure requirements and the casual monitoring of how the money is used some analysts fear that there could be a few mega - crashes which could hurt market confidence far more than the small bankruptcies that followed the boom of <unk>
the government insists that such a possibility is low
it says that despite loose regulation of the market itself its longstanding regulation of industry will prevent such crashes

the segment is soon to be broadcast on the <unk> <unk> series <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> thus further blurring the distinction between fiction and reality in tv news
it is the <unk> <unk> come to television
<unk> <unk> program is just one of several network shows and many more in syndication that rely on the controversial technique of reconstructing events using actors who are supposed to resemble real people living and dead
<unk> <unk> however is said to be the only network news program in history <unk> to employ casting directors
<unk> <unk> in this case is to be played by <unk> actor <unk> <unk> who is n't new to the character
he was <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk> production of a play called the <unk> <unk> <unk>
television news of course has always been part show - biz
broadcasters have a healthy appreciation of the role n entertainment values play in captivating an audience
but as <unk> <unk> <unk> president <unk> <unk> puts it the network now needs to broaden the horizons of nonfiction television and that includes some experimentation
since its premiere <unk> <unk> the show on which <unk> <unk> appears has used an actor to portray the <unk> <unk> <unk> a civil - rights leader and one to play a teenage drug dealer
it has depicted the bombing of <unk> <unk> flight n over the scottish town of <unk>
on <unk> n it did a rendition of the kidnapping and imprisonment of <unk> <unk> correspondent <unk> <unk> who was abducted in <unk> <unk> and is believed to be held in <unk>
the production had actors playing <unk> <unk> and former hostages <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> has similarly branched out into entertainment gimmickry
<unk> <unk> <unk> a new show this season featuring <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> has a studio audience that applauds and that one night to the embarrassment of the network waved at the camera like the crowd on <unk> <unk> a <unk>
<unk> stops short of using an applause sign and a comic to warm up the audience
the stars do that themselves
<unk> <unk> has produced three episodes of an occasional series produced by <unk> <unk> called <unk> <unk> and <unk> starring <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> that also gives work to actors
call it a fad
or call it the wave of the future
<unk> re - creations are produced by <unk> - <unk> <unk> which also makes the successful prime - time <unk> <unk> series <unk> mysteries
the marriage of news and theater if not exactly inevitable has been consummated nonetheless
news programs particularly if they score well in the ratings appeal to the networks cost - conscious corporate parents because they are so much less expensive to produce than an entertainment show is somewhere between <unk> and <unk> for a one - hour program
entertainment shows tend to cost twice that
re - enactments have been used successfully for several seasons on such syndicated tabloid tv shows as <unk> <unk> <unk> which is produced by the <unk> <unk> <unk> unit of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
that show whose host is <unk> <unk> husband <unk> <unk> has a particular penchant for grisly murders and stories having to do with sex the <unk> <unk> murder case the <unk> <unk> tapes what have you
<unk> <unk> the executive producer of <unk> <unk> <unk> says we have opened eyes to being a little less conservative and more imaginative in how to present the news
nowhere have eyes been opened wider than at <unk> <unk>
at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> one floor below the offices of <unk> <unk> the most successful prime - time news program ever actors wait in the reception area to audition for <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> sends scripts to agents who pass them along to clients
the network deals a lot with unknowns including <unk> <unk> who portrayed <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> but the network has some big names <unk> to contend with too
<unk> <unk> <unk> is cast to play the <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> may portray former <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a forthcoming epsiode on <unk> <unk> the last man n to be executed in <unk> in <unk>
<unk> <unk> has cast actors to appear in future stories ranging from the abortion rights of teen - agers to a <unk> n segment on a man named <unk> <unk> who calls himself a monster and is reputed to be the toughest prisoner in <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> which as recently as two years ago fired hundreds of its employees in budget cutbacks now hires featured actors beginning at <unk> a week
that is n't much compared with what <unk> <unk> makes or even <unk> <unk> for that matter who is paid n million a year and who recently did a guest shot of her own on the sitcom <unk> <unk>
but the money is n't peanuts either particularly for a news program
<unk> <unk> is also re - enacting the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> nuclear accident in <unk> <unk> with something less than a cast of thousands
it is combing the town of <unk> for about <unk> extras
on <unk> n the town mayor <unk> <unk> made an announcement on behalf of <unk> during half - time at the <unk> <unk> <unk> football game asking for volunteers
there was a roll of laughter through the stands says <unk> <unk> the editor of the weekly <unk> and <unk> in <unk>
they filming right now at the bank down the street and they want shots of people getting out of cars and kids on skateboards
they are approaching everyone on the street and asking if they want to be in a docudrama
<unk> <unk> says <unk> he would n't dream of participating himself
no way
i think n re - enactments stink
though a re - enactment may have the flavor <unk> on the <unk> it is n't
some producers seem tentative about the technique squeamish even
so the results while not news are n't exactly theater either at least not good theater
and some people do think that acting out scripts is n't worthy of <unk> <unk> which once lent prestige to the network and set standards for the industry
in his review of <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the tv critic of the <unk> <unk> and generally an admirer of <unk> wrote that while the show is impressive one has to wonder if this is the proper direction n for a network news division to take
re - creating events has in general upset news traditionalists including former <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and former <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> former <unk> <unk> anchorman <unk> <unk> and the new dean of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>
says she once you add dramatizations it no longer news it drama and that has no place on a network news broadcast
they should never be on
never
criticism of the <unk> <unk> segment is particularly scathing among people who knew and loved the man
that includes his companion of n years <unk> <unk> as well as his former wife <unk>
both women say <unk> they also find it distasteful that <unk> <unk> is apparently concentrating on <unk> <unk> problems as a manic - depressive
this is dangerous and misrepresents <unk> life says <unk> <unk> who has had an advance look at the n script
it a sensational piece about someone who is not here to defend himself
<unk> <unk> says that dramatization makes the truth flexible
it takes one person account and gives it authenticity
<unk> <unk> interviewed <unk> <unk> and his sister <unk> as well as <unk> <unk> landlord in <unk> <unk> <unk>
also <unk> <unk> who collaborated with <unk> <unk> on two books
<unk> <unk> says i wanted to be interviewed to get <unk> story out and maybe talking about the illness will do some good
the executive producer of <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> declines to discuss re - creactions as a practice or his show in particular
i do n't talk about my work he says
the president of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> did n't return numerous telephone calls
one person close to the process says n it would not be in the best interest of <unk> <unk> to comment on a work in progress such as the <unk> re - creation but says <unk> <unk> <unk> is aware of the concerns of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> former wife
neither woman was invited by <unk> <unk> to participate in a round - table discussion about <unk> <unk> that is to follow the re - enactment
<unk> <unk> the actor who plays <unk> <unk> says <unk> he was concerned at first that the script would misrepresent an astute political mind one that i admired but that his concerns were allayed
the producers he says <unk> did a good job of depicting someone who had done so much but who was also a manic - depressive
<unk> <unk> the world largest advertising agency on the strength of its dominance in the japanese market is setting its sights on overseas expansion
last year <unk> started <unk> a joint network with <unk> ad agency <unk> <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
a few months ago <unk> acquired <unk> of australian agency <unk> <unk> holdings <unk> for n million australian dollars <unk> n million
<unk> has <unk> subsidiaries but they keep low profiles
now the giant marketing company which holds n of <unk> n trillion yen n billion advertising industry is considering the acquisition of an advertising network in the <unk> or <unk>
what is driving <unk> international expansion largely is the need to keep up with its japanese clients as they grow in the <unk> and <unk>
if we do n't do something we wo n't be able to catch up with demand says a <unk> spokesman
our president said <unk> acquisition is an effective method
last year <unk> foreign business accounted for less than n of total billings but the company is aiming at <unk> in the near future
so far it appears cautious about taking the big step
for example the spokesman says n <unk> has been approached by banks and securities companies a number of times to invest in the troubled british marketing group <unk> <unk> <unk>
but he said <unk> <unk> has n't looked seriously at <unk>
though <unk> says n it has no concrete acquisition plans or deadlines it is laying the groundwork for international growth
it is setting up a special team in charge of international markets and training workers to do business abroad
for the year ended <unk> <unk> <unk> sales rose <unk> to n billion from n billion and net income jumped <unk> to n million from n million
<unk> billings last year were larger than those of young <unk> the world second - largest ad agency according to a survey by the publication <unk> <unk>
but success overseas in unfamiliar markets could be trickier than for other industries such as manufacturers
on its own <unk> muscle in <unk> may count for little in major foreign markets when seeking non - japanese clients
thus an acquisition may prove the necessary course
but japanese agencies are cautious about expanding abroad because client relationships are different
japanese agencies do business with rival clients in the same industry a practice that would be unacceptable by traditional western conflict rules says <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> chief executive of <unk> <unk> communications division
although acquiring a foreign company would expand japanese advertising agencies business to foreign clients many clients would also be japanese companies expanding overseas says <unk> the <unk> spokesman
but the different business system would make it hard for <unk> to provide these japanese companies the same kind of services n they do in <unk>

the property claims service division of the <unk> <unk> services <unk> estimated insured losses from the earthquake at n million
this estimate does n't include claims under workers compensation life health disability and liability insurance and damage to infrastructure such as bridges highways and public buildings
the estimated earthquake losses are low compared with the n billion in claims that insurers face from <unk> <unk> which ripped through the <unk> and the carolinas last month
that because only about <unk> of <unk> homes and businesses had earthquake insurance n to cover the losses
however insurance brokers and executives say that the combination of the <unk> area earthquake <unk> and last week explosion at the <unk> <unk> <unk> refinery in <unk> <unk> will cause property insurance and reinsurance rates to jump

the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the world chief oil futures marketplace is at a critical juncture
several longtime observers of the commodities industry think n the fortunes of the <unk> over the next decade will be determined to a large extent by how well its new natural gas futures contract does and how successful its new president is in raising the level of compliance by floor traders with exchange and <unk> futures <unk> <unk> rules
if the exchange falters in these moves they say <unk> it might once again fall behind its chief <unk> <unk> competitor the <unk> <unk>
on <unk> the <unk> board announced that it had approved <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> as the delivery site for its long - awaited natural gas futures contract
it also said that it would start trading the contract as soon as the <unk> approved it
the <unk> has <unk> days n to respond to such applications
the <unk> first started working on developing this contract in <unk>
only three weeks earlier the <unk> had turned to one of its own executives n <unk> <unk> <unk> to replace <unk> <unk> <unk> as president
<unk> <unk> is believed to have a mandate from the board of directors to help improve the <unk> tarnished reputation as an exchange whose floor traders do n't follow the rules very well
<unk> <unk> had been forced out in <unk> in a bitter power struggle with <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman and a longtime floor trader on the exchange
<unk> <unk> told one person familiar with the <unk> <unk> exchanges during the search for a replacement that he was looking for a president who would be responsive to the needs of the membership and the board
<unk> <unk> first came to the exchange in <unk> and has been executive vice president since <unk> <unk>
he previously held posts of senior vice president of compliance and senior vice president and general counsel
by contrast the <unk> in <unk> imported a highly regarded outsider <unk> <unk> <unk> as its president
<unk> <unk> <unk> was a senior officer of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and is considered a specialist in new financial products
<unk> <unk> is n't bereft of experience with new products however
for the past two years he said n he and the exchange research department have been working on the new natural gas contract seeking a good delivery site and studying the natural gas market
our members are eager to begin trading this contract so we expect no difficulty in attracting locals to the natural gas pit he said n
the educational effort of teaching companies in the natural gas industry how to use the futures to hedge would have to continue for another a year or two he added n
the <unk> extremely successful contracts in crude oil gasoline and heating oil have made it the largest futures exchange in <unk> <unk> and third behind the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
in a recent interview <unk> <unk> said n the biggest problem facing all commodity exchanges was one of image
earlier this year the <unk> attorney indicted <unk> floor traders and one clerk at the two big <unk> exchanges
federal authorities in <unk> <unk> started investigating exchanges in <unk> though no indictments have been handed down there
so far they have issued scores of subpoenas some of which went to members of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> will have to face some of the consequences of those subpoenas
in a recent <unk> <unk> <unk> study the <unk> was found to have been the most lax in enforcing exchange rules
it levied the smallest number of suspensions of traders and fines of the four largest commodity exchanges studied over the past five years
it also had both the fewest and least experienced investigators per million contracts traded
the <unk> received considerable criticism in n when it was discovered that its compliance director <unk> <unk> <unk> who then was responsible for policing the exchange busy oil and metal pits was engaged in other personal business activities on <unk> time including out - of-state trips according to a <unk> <unk> <unk> report prepared last year
<unk> <unk> is no longer at the exchange
we had a management breakdown in <unk> in terms of compliance <unk> <unk> says
we recognized the problem and took care of it
he says that even if the natural gas contract boosts volume at the exchange strongly the n business plan calls for having adequate compliance people n to ensure that exchange rules are being followed
for years the five <unk> <unk> exchanges have been talking about cooperating in various aspects of their business in order to improve the efficiency of their operations
periodically there has even been talk of mergers between one or more exchanges
so far there is little n to show for such efforts
<unk> <unk> believes <unk> the case for working together is stronger now than ever
the cost of competition has become extremely high he says
we must find ways <unk> to save money for the futures commission merchants who do business on our exchanges
he thinks that progress in cooperation can be made in areas where no vested interests have built up
one of those areas is the development of a hand - held electronic device that would permit floor traders to enter trades as they make them
the <unk> has recommended the creation of a system <unk> to record trade data so that an independent verifiable audit trail can be established to prevent customer fraud
the <unk> is now cooperating with the <unk> in developing such a device n to provide such an audit trail
the <unk> exchanges also are working on such a device
another major electronics problem faces <unk> <unk> the creation of a <unk> trading system that can be used outside normal trading hours
in <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> signed a letter of intent with the <unk> <unk> as a preliminary step to joining their electronic system <unk> called <unk>
but in <unk> the <unk> <unk> said <unk> it was looking into creating a common system with the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and it suspended negotiations with the <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> says <unk> his exchange is n't waiting for the results of the <unk> exchanges cooperation
it recently began a pilot program <unk> to test an electronic trading system called <unk> the automated trading system created by the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
looking ahead to commodity markets this week
<unk> <unk> metals trader for <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> said n there is good technical support between <unk> and <unk> a pound for <unk> copper which ended <unk> at <unk> a pound up <unk> cents
he views the <unk> to n range as a buying opportunity and considers the market oversold
i think n the market could pop up to the <unk> to <unk> level without too much difficulty he said
but he said n it wo n't climb further and he expects it to remain in a trading range between <unk> and <unk>
he noted that the equity markets will set the tone for the industrial metals this week and traders should keep an eye on <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> research director for <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> said n for a rally to occur there must be demand from the <unk> <unk>
he added that talk of strike settlements at producing mines has been fully discounted
however to resume the bull trend according to <unk> <unk> copper would have to close over n
he said n there are two reports this week that might affect prices the purchasing managers report on <unk> and the unemployment report on <unk>
precious
<unk> strong price gains confirmed a turnaround in the precious metals markets according to <unk> <unk> <unk>
most traders will be looking to buy on pullbacks he said
he thought the moves in the metals last week were most influenced by the uncertainty in the equity and other financial markets
according to <unk> <unk> floor traders say n there is good support for <unk> gold in the <unk> to n per ounce area around <unk> an ounce for <unk> silver and in the <unk> to n an ounce range for <unk> platinum
<unk> <unk> research director for <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> said the price action for all of last week is the best n he has seen on a weekly basis in more than a year
he said n last week activity in gold could portend a move to n an ounce for the <unk> contract
he also said n traders should keep an eye on the stock market because if the stock market rallies that could spell trouble for the precious metals
he said n traders should be on the lookout for how metals producers react to this rally
i expect to see some selling but will they kill this one as they have every rally in the recent past by selling and locking in prices for their production
he noted that for the first time in months there was some light investor interest in the metals
grains and
prices this week will likely be dominated by reports on the progress of the corn and soybean harvest as well as by speculation about more purchases of <unk> crops by the <unk> <unk>
in recent weeks warm and dry weather has sped the <unk> harvest and that is permitting farmers to rebuild the stockpiles that were cut by the <unk> drought
if the weather allowed farmers to work in their fields over the weekend many <unk> grain elevators will probably sell futures contracts today at the <unk> <unk> of <unk> in order to hedge their weekend purchases from farmers
that selling of futures contracts by elevators is what helps keep downward pressure on crop prices during the harvest
traders will also watch for whether the <unk> <unk> continues its traditional fall buying of <unk> grain
so far this month the soviets have bought about n million metric tons of <unk> corn
there may be some activity in soybean prices this week as investors try to get rid of the contract for <unk> delivery
investors usually do n't want to take physical delivery of a contract preferring instead to profit from its price swings and then end any obligation to take delivery or make delivery as it nears expiration
employees of the <unk> and <unk> a <unk> <unk> newspaper in <unk> voted to accept a tentative contract agreement <unk> averting a strike at <unk> leading daily

in addition to wage increases the union negotiated improved vacation plans benefit packages and pension plans <unk> <unk> said <unk>
he said <unk> more than n of the bargaining unit voted in favor of the agreement
<unk> <unk> is just about ready to line the bird cage with paper stocks
for three years a healthy economy and the export - boosting effects of a weak dollar propelled sales and earnings of the big paper companies to record levels
as the good times rolled they more than doubled their prices for pulp a raw material used in all sorts of paper to <unk> a metric ton this past spring from <unk> a ton at the start of <unk>
but now the companies are getting into trouble because they undertook a record expansion program while they were raising prices sharply
third - quarter profits fell at several companies
put your money in a good utility or bank stock not a paper company advises <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
other analysts are nearly as pessimistic
<unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> expects a <unk> decline in earnings between now and <unk> for commodity - oriented paper companies which account for the majority of the industry
<unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> sees paper - company stock prices falling n to <unk> in <unk> perhaps n if there a recession
paper companies concede that business has been off recently
but they attribute much of the weakness to customer inventory reductions
generally they maintain that barring a recession and a further strengthening of the dollar against foreign currencies the industry is n't headed for a prolonged slump
it wo n't be an earthshaking drop a <unk> spokesman says
last week <unk> <unk> lowered his rating from hold to avoid on <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>

<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> said n a number of other analysts are recommending them because of their strong wood - products business
<unk> <unk> <unk> said we not as exposed as the popular perception of us
the company explained that its main product bleached paperboard which goes into some advertising materials and white boxes historically does n't have sharp price swings
because the stock prices of some paper companies already reflect an expected profit slump <unk> <unk> <unk> says <unk> he thinks that next year the share prices of some companies may fall at most only <unk> to n
a company such as <unk> <unk> <unk> may be overly discounted and looks tempting to him he says n though he is n't yet recommending the shares
<unk> <unk> is n't avoiding everything connected with paper
<unk> <unk> recommends <unk> - <unk> explaining that it is virtually the sole major paper company not undergoing a major capacity expansion and thus should be able to lower long - term debt substantially next year
a <unk> - <unk> spokesman said n the company expects record earnings in n and we still pretty bullish on <unk>
the analysts say n their gloomy forecasts have a flip side
some take a warm view of consumer - oriented paper companies which buy pulp from the commodity producers and should benefit from the expected declines in pulp prices
estimates on how much pulp prices will fall next year currently run between <unk> and n a metric ton
analysts agree that the price drop should especially benefit the two big tissue makers <unk> <unk> and <unk> - <unk>
a spokesman for <unk> says that assuming <unk> the price of pulp continues to soften we should do well

<unk> <unk> made the earnings projection for fiscal <unk> ending next <unk> <unk> in an interview with <unk> automotive writers attending the <unk> <unk> <unk>

during the next decade <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> plans to boost overseas vehicle production sufficiently to account for a majority of sales outside <unk>
last year <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> exported slightly over one million vehicles and produced <unk> cars and trucks at its factories in <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
but by <unk> he added <unk> <unk> will build one million vehicles a year outside <unk> or sufficient to equal exports
by the end of the <unk> he said we want to be producing roughly two vehicles overseas for every vehicle that we export from <unk>
that will involve a substantial increase in overseas manufacturing capacity he acknowledged <unk> but did n't provide specific details
<unk> <unk> <unk> said n it expects to report a charge of n million related to the sale of its aluminum unit extrusion division for the third quarter
the company said n it has agreed to sell the extrusion division for n million to <unk> <unk> <unk> a closely held firm based in <unk> <unk>

the municipal bond market is bracing for tough times through the end of the year as it struggles to absorb an oversupply of bonds and two of its best customers turn into sellers
commercial banks and property\/casualty insurers which together own about <unk> of all municipal bonds have been dumping their securities for weeks
last week traders said n there were three institutional sellers for every buyer
every day we getting new bid lists from would - be sellers one trader said n
most dealers can not continue to absorb this supply
as a result yields on long - term muni bonds now stand at about <unk> of long - term <unk> yields the highest such level in more than two years
there is incredible negative psychology building in the market said <unk> <unk> a vice president at <unk> <unk> <unk>
people are very concerned about who is going to step up to the plate and buy municipal bonds in the absence of institutional buyers
the yield on a group of <unk> revenue bonds compiled by the <unk> <unk> a trade publication now exceeds n
at this week <unk> <unk> <unk> bond sale traders expect yields on the <unk> <unk> <unk> bonds to nearly match the n yield on <unk> <unk> bonds
for an investor in the <unk> federal tax bracket n tax - free is the same as <unk> on a taxable investment
that a taxable - equivalent yield nearly three percentage points more than the current yield on <unk> <unk> bonds
how quickly things change
this past summer investors appetite for municipal bonds seemed insatiable
individuals eager for tax - free income drove up bond prices making state and local government debt one of the best - performing types of fixed - income investments during the period
but while analysts say that municipal bonds still offer good value you would n't know it by the way n institutional investors are rushing to dump their holdings
bond market analysts say n the institutional selling was triggered by several factors
big banks such as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> which have been taking heavy charges to expand their <unk> <unk> loan - loss reserves are n't looking for tax - exempt income
we do n't need the shelter of tax - free bonds said a spokeswoman at <unk>
in recent weeks traders said <unk> <unk> has sold more than <unk> billion of tax - free bonds
the spokeswoman confirmed that the bank has significantly reduced its muni holdings but could n't immediately confirm the amount
insurance companies are rushing to sell before the end of the year when some of their tax benefits associated with municipal bonds will be phased out
there is speculation that property\/casualty firms will sell even more munis as they scramble to raise cash n to pay claims related to <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> earthquake
fundamental factors are at work as well
muni bond holders are worried about the impact of a slowing economy on tax revenue at a time when many state and local governments already face budget deficits and huge spending needs
the recent natural disasters and the need of many other cities to rebuild crumbling infrastructure suggests that supply of new issues will continue to rise sharply even as demand tapers off
there is just so much going on that it difficult to pick just one factor that driving the market said <unk> <unk> <unk> vice president at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a subsidiary of <unk> <unk> <unk>
some of the recent selling could actually be considered a positive sign
mutual funds for example are said to be selling existing municipal bonds to raise cash n to buy new issues
because municipal bonds yields have risen at a time when interest rates generally have fallen some portfolio managers are assuming that bonds bought now will appreciate in value as the municipal bond market rebounds
<unk> <unk> believes that the mutual funds are selling muni bonds that have a negative convexity those that have appreciated in price slowly relative to the decline in interest rates
such bonds she says n are those that are nearing their call date
but traders said n the market tone could pick up this week if <unk> <unk> <unk> n million bond offering goes well
the offering will include n million of n tax - exempt bonds and n million of taxable bonds
a few weeks ago <unk> <unk> sold n million of tax - exempts
<unk> <unk> <unk> bonds have been beaten down for three straight weeks
on <unk> some issues fell nearly one point or close to <unk> for each <unk> face amount
the sell - off in <unk> <unk> <unk> bonds was triggered by concerns about the city financial health and political uncertainty in view of the impending mayoral election
the city economy is growing weaker and expenditures are rising as tax revenue is falling
the city has issued so much supply recently that some people are getting a little concerned
they like to see some other names in their portfolios said <unk> <unk> <unk> first vice president at <unk> <unk> <unk>
but he thinks n investors may be overreacting to the market problems
overall he says n municipal prices are very cheap and represent an excellent buying opportunity
<unk> <unk>
<unk> bonds fell sharply on confusion about this week <unk> debt auction and rumors that a major japanese investor was unloading large amounts of long - term bonds
the <unk> benchmark <unk> bond ended at a price of <unk> <unk> down nearly n point from <unk> or about n for each <unk> face amount
the issue yield rose to <unk> from <unk>
late <unk> the <unk> said n it needed to raise n billion quickly and would do so by issuing new securities this week
credit market analysts expected the <unk> to cancel today three - month and six - month sale and to sell n billion of cash management bills
instead the <unk> announced n it would sell n billion of <unk> cash management bills today and said that the weekly sale of <unk> billion of three - month and six - month bills will take place today as usual but the sale will settle tomorrow instead of <unk>
by moving the settlement date ahead the <unk> can raise money under the <unk> trillion debt ceiling that is in effect through tomorrow after which it reverts to <unk> trillion
the market also was hurt by rumors that <unk> <unk> <unk> a japanese brokerage firm was unloading some of the <unk> bonds n it recently purchased
one dealer said <unk> the talk was that the firm sold about n million of bellwether n bonds
the firm is thought to have purchased up to <unk> billion of <unk> bonds in a buying spree on <unk> and the previous <unk>
dealers say n the firm apparently has wanted to publicize its recent buying and subsequent selling of <unk> bonds by using <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as a broker
<unk> provides price quotes to <unk> <unk> <unk> a widely used electronic system
<unk> <unk> moves puzzled traders and created confusion among potential investors many of whom decided to stay out of the market
as a result of its large - scale buying some analysts now say that liquidity or the ability to easily buy and sell has been constrained in the benchmark <unk> bond issue
in other markets
the junk bonds of <unk> <unk> <unk> rallied <unk> on news that the company is selling its candy bar brands to <unk> <unk> <unk> for n million
the sale price which was above <unk> <unk> expectations sent many <unk> securities up by one point
it shows that there are buyers of high - quality assets at high prices in today market said <unk> <unk> managing director and head of the high - yield research department at <unk> <unk> <unk>
many of the <unk> securities which had been trading near their n lows earlier in the session bounced back after the company announcement that it agreed to sell its <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> candy businesses to <unk> <unk> a unit of the <unk> - based food concern

twice in two weeks the unraveling of the on - again off - again <unk> buy - out slammed the stock market
now stock prices seem to be in a general retreat
since peaking at <unk> on <unk> n the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has lost <unk> points or <unk> closing <unk> at <unk> down <unk>
the number of issues falling on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> each day is eclipsing the number of gainers
and the number of stocks hitting new lows far outstrips the number setting new highs
but why should an iffy n billion leveraged buy - out deal shake the foundations of the entire stock market
opinions vary about how important the <unk> deal was to the market health but analysts generally agree that the market gyrations created as the <unk> plan crumbled revealed a fundamental change in investor psychology
if this had happened a few months ago when the atmosphere was still very positive it would n't have been greeted with anything like the impact n it has had over the past two weeks says <unk> <unk> a market strategist at <unk> <unk>
there are of course analysts who view the near - panic that briefly swept through investors on <unk> n and again on <unk> n as momentary lapses of good judgment that have only temporarily undermined a healthy stock market
sure price action is volatile and that scary but all - in-all stocks are still a good place <unk> to be they suggest n
the reaction to the <unk> debacle is mindless says <unk> <unk> <unk> chief market strategist at <unk> <unk>
<unk> is a small deal as far as the overall market is concerned
the only way n you can make it a big deal is to draw linkages that just do n't make sense
he suggests for example that investors may have assumed that just because <unk> could n't get financing no leveraged buy - outs can get financing
carried even further some investors assumed that since leveraged buy - outs are the only thing propping up stock prices the market would collapse if no more lbos could be done
there will still be deals argues <unk> <unk>
there may not be as many and the buyers may not get away with some of the things n they done in the past but deals wo n't disappear
he forecasts that the emphasis in mergers and acquisitions may soon return to what he calls strategic deals in which somebody is taking over a company not to milk the cash flow but because it a good fit
and even without deals <unk> <unk> figures n the market would remain healthy
he notes for instance that there has n't been a merger or acquisition among the n stocks in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> since n yet that average only three weeks ago hit a record high
those stocks are up because their earnings are up and their dividends are up he says
even the volatility created by stock index arbitrage and other computer - driven trading strategies is n't entirely bad in <unk> <unk> view
for the long - term investor who picks stocks carefully the price volatility can provide welcome buying opportunities as short - term players scramble frantically to sell stocks in a matter of minutes
who can make the better decision the guy who has n seconds n to decide what to do or the guy with all the time in the world he says
what on earth does the <unk> deal have to do with the price of <unk> which i was able to buy on <unk> n at a very attractive price
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> also sees some benefits to the stock market recent drop
we run into a market that was beginning to run out of steam and get frothy he says
the balloon had been blown up so big that when somebody came along with a pin in this case the <unk> deal we got a little pop
the pop sobered up investors who had been getting a little too ebullient says <unk> <unk> <unk>
it provided an excuse n for people to get back to reality and to look at the economic data especially the third - quarter economic numbers and to realize that we ca n't continue to gloss over what is going on in the junk bond market
but he figures that at current levels the stock market is comfortably valued even with the economy obviously slowing
just because we got some realism back in the market does n't mean <unk> it going lower from here he says
the bottom line is that it healthy to have this kind of sideways activity especially after a n gain in stock values over the past <unk> months
he now estimating that after a period of consolidation the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> will once again forge new highs
maybe maybe not
<unk> <unk> <unk> a market strategist at <unk> <unk> <unk> is n't nearly so sanguine about the market chances of surging to new highs anytime soon
her view is that stock prices have three major props merger and buy - out proposals earnings and the economic outlook
at current levels of economic activity and earnings stocks are fairly valued she says n
but any chance for prices to surge above fair value lies in the speculation that accompanies a vigorous merger and buy - out business and <unk> has obviously put a damper on that
stocks are n't cheap anymore there have been some judicial and legislative changes in the merger area and all of this changes the arithmetic of deals she says
i not saying n they stopped altogether but future deals are going to be structured differently and bids probably wo n't be as high
but that not the only problem for stocks
the other two props earnings and the economic outlook are troubling too
<unk> is getting all the headlines right now but these other things have been building up more gradually she says
third - quarter earnings have been generally disappointing and with economic data showing a clear slowing the outlook for earnings in the fourth quarter and all of <unk> is getting worse
there are a lot more downward than upward revisions and it looks like people are questioning corporate profits as a means of support for stock prices she says
with all this can stock prices hold their own
the question is unanswerable at this point she says
it depends on what happens
if the economy slips into a recession then this is n't a level that going to hold

federal investigators have identified the problem in last <unk> crash of a <unk> <unk> flight in <unk> a structural flaw that developed during the making of a titanium engine disk
for several months officials at the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> have suspected that a metallurgical flaw in the disk led to a crack that ultimately caused the tail engine to break apart in flight
the explosion sent shards of metal flying severing the <unk> hydraulic or control systems and led to the crash that killed n people
but investigators could confirm their theory only after the recent retrieval of a big chunk of <unk> n tail engine from a cornfield near the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>
the safety board will begin four days of hearings on the accident tomorrow in <unk> <unk>
among the issues <unk> the board will examine is whether <unk> <unk> a unit of <unk> <unk> should have been able to detect the cracks through maintenance checks
the engine involved was a n made by <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> the <unk> acting executive director for regulatory standards and compliance said that recent tests of the failed engine disk indicate that a flaw known as hard alpha occurred in the titanium during its production almost n years ago
he said n there was n't any way n to detect the flaw at that time and that the process has since been changed to decrease the chance that such flaws would occur
the <unk> already has ordered that all <unk> disks made by the old process be removed from the planes and subjected to an ultrasonic test in a water - submersion chamber
such tests make the <unk> confident that a <unk> <unk> - type accident wo n't happen again said <unk> <unk> <unk>
a spokesman for <unk> said that the company has been working with the <unk> all along on this issue and will comply fully with the required inspections
but he also pointed out that the recalls will have no impact on <unk> engine production
the <unk> series engines are n't being manufactured any more they are only being used in the <unk> <unk> <unk> planes currently in service he said n
a frozen mountaintop in <unk> may offer an important clue about whether the <unk> is warming perilously
researchers at <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> in <unk> have analyzed samples of glacial ice in <unk> and say n temperatures there have been significantly higher on average over the past half - century than in any similar period in the past <unk> years
the ice samples are an important piece of evidence supporting theories that the <unk> has warmed considerably in recent times largely because of pollutants in the air and will warm far more in the century ahead
a substantial warming would melt some of the <unk> polar ice caps raising the level of the oceans and causing widespread flooding of heavily populated coastal areas
if you can use data to reconstruct what happened in the past you have much more confidence in predictions for the future said <unk> <unk> a research scientist at <unk> <unk> who dug for and analyzed the ice samples
to compare temperatures over the past n years researchers analyzed the changes in concentrations of two forms of oxygen
these measurements can indicate temperature changes researchers said n because the rates of evaporation of these oxygen atoms differ as temperatures change
analysis of ice from the <unk> ice cap a glacial plateau in <unk> <unk> feet above sea level show that average temperatures were higher in n than in any other n period since before the last <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk>
some climate models project that interior regions of <unk> would be among the first n to heat up in a global warming because they are far from oceans which moderate temperature changes
but the ice - core samples are n't definitive proof that the so - called greenhouse effect will lead to further substantial global heating <unk> <unk> acknowledged n
according to greenhouse theories increased carbon dioxide emissions largely caused by burning of fossil fuels will cause the <unk> to warm up because carbon dioxide prevents heat from escaping into space
skeptics say that if that the case temperatures should have risen fairly uniformly over the past century reflecting the increase in carbon dioxide
instead the <unk> ice - core record shows increasing temperatures from <unk> through the early n decreasing temperatures from the late <unk> through the <unk> then higher temperatures again through last year
other temperature data show similar unexplained swings
climate varies drastically due to natural causes said <unk> <unk>
but he said n ice samples from <unk> <unk> and <unk> all show substantial signs of warming
<unk> <unk> said <unk> its vice president for manufacturing resigned and its <unk> work force has been trimmed by n people or about <unk>

as reported <unk> agreed to be acquired by a group of investors led by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> a share or about n million
<unk> sent to <unk> <unk> an <unk> billion military construction bill that cuts spending for new installations by n while revamping the <unk> budget to move more than n million from foreign bases to home - state projects
the fiscal <unk> measure builds on a pattern set earlier this year by <unk> and <unk> defense authorizing committees and at a time of retrenchment for the military and concern about the <unk> standing in the world economy overseas spending is most vulnerable
total <unk> requests for installations in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> and the philippines for example are cut by almost two - thirds while lawmakers added to the military budget for construction in all but a dozen states at home
the result is that instead of the <unk> proposed split of <unk> between domestic and foreign bases the reduced funding is distributed by a ratio of approximately n
the extra margin for bases in the <unk> enhances the power of the appropriations committees meanwhile lawmakers used their positions to garner as much as six times what the <unk> had requested for their individual states
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> helped secure n million for his state or more than double the <unk> budget
<unk> <unk> home of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> would receive n million four times the military request
<unk> and <unk> <unk> home states of the two democratic chairmen of the <unk> and <unk> military construction subcommittees receive n million or <unk> above the <unk> request
though spending for <unk> and <unk> was far less their increases above <unk> requests <unk> and <unk> respectively were much greater because of the influence of republicans at critical junctures
the swift passage of the bill which cleared the <unk> and <unk> on simple voice votes last week contrasts with the problems still facing a more cumbersome n billion measure funding housing environmental space and veterans programs
by an <unk> margin the <unk> approved the bulk of the spending <unk> but the bill was then sent back to the <unk> to resolve the question of how to address budget limits on credit allocations for the <unk> <unk> <unk>
the <unk> democratic leadership could seek to waive these restrictions but the underlying bill is already under attack for excesses elsewhere
appropriations committees have used an assortment of devices to disguise as much as n billion in spending and as critics have awakened to these devices the bill can seem like a wounded caribou trying to make it past ice and wolves to reach safer winter grazing
much of the excess spending will be pushed into fiscal n and in some cases is temporarily parked in slow - spending accounts in anticipation of being transferred to faster - spending areas after the budget scorekeeping is completed
for example a <unk> - <unk> conference ostensibly increased the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> budget for construction of facilities to nearly n million or more than n million above what either chamber had previously approved
part of the increase would provide n million toward ensuring construction of a costly solid rocket - motor facility in <unk> <unk> <unk>
but as much as n million or nearly n of the account is marked for potential transfers to research management and flight accounts that are spent out at a faster clip
the bill managers face criticism too for the unusual number of conditions openly imposed on where funds will be spent
conservatives embarrassed by republican influence - peddling scandals at the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> have used the issue in an effort to shift blame onto a <unk> - controlled <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> backed an unsuccessful effort to strike such language last week but received little support from the <unk> <unk> budget office which wants to protect space - station funding in the bill and has tended to turn its eyes from pork - barrel amendments
within discretionary funds for community development grants more than n million is allocated to six projects in <unk> home state of a subcommittee chairman <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> won n for a project in his district in <unk> state and n million earmarked by <unk> <unk> <unk> amounts to a business subsidy under the title hawaiian sugar mills job retention
the powerful <unk> had first wanted to add language relaxing environmental restrictions on two mills on the <unk> coast that are threatening to close
when this plan met resistance it was agreed instead to take money from <unk> to subsidize needed improvements in two settling ponds for the mills which employ an estimated n workers according to <unk> <unk> office
<unk> <unk> <unk> n page - one article river of despair about the poverty along the <unk> fanned childhood memories of when my parents were sharecroppers in southeastern <unk> only a few miles from the river
although we were white the same economic factors affected us as affects the black people n <unk> <unk> writes about
fortunately an aunt with a college degree bought a small farm and moved us n miles north to good schools and an environment that opened the world of opportunity for me as an eight - year-old
though i been blessed with academic degrees and some success in the materialistic world i never forgotten or lost contact with those memories of the <unk>
most of the land in that and other parts of the <unk> are now owned by second third or fourth generations of the same families
these are the families who used and sometime abused their sharecroppers people who had no encouragement and little access to an education or training for a better life
following <unk> <unk> <unk> when one family with mechanized equipment could farm crops formerly requiring n families the surplus people were dumped into the mainstream of society with no <unk> <unk> no skills in the workplace no hope for their future except welfare
and today many of their children grandchildren and great - grandchildren remain on welfare
in the meantime the landowners continue receiving generous subsidies that began during <unk> <unk> days
or those who choose not to farm can lease their lands and crop allotments for handsome sums
farmers in the <unk> and other areas have suffered but those along the <unk> continue to prosper with holdings that were built with the sweat of men and women living in economic slavery
and when they were no longer needed they were turned loose unprepared to build lives of their own

because the cycle of poverty along the lower <unk> goes back so many generations breaking this cycle will be next to impossible
sadly the cycle appears not as waves but as a downward spiral
yet the evidence that we have not hit bottom is found in the fact that we are not yet helping ourselves
the people of the <unk> are waiting for that big factory n to open river traffic n to increase government spending <unk> to fund job - training programs or public schools n to educate apathetic students
because we refuse to face the tough answers the questions continue as fodder for the commissions and committees for the media and politicians
coffee - shop chatter does not lend itself to solving the problems of racism teen pregnancy or lack of parental support or guidance
does the <unk> deserve government help in attracting industry when the majority of residents black and white do not realize n racism alienates potential employers
should we focus on the region infant - mortality rate when the vocal right - wingers and the school boards mayors and legislators prohibit schools from teaching the two ways abstinence or contraceptives of decreasing teen pregnancy
<unk> problems are difficult not impossible n to solve i am just not convinced that we are ready to solve them yet

i would like to issue a challenge to corporate <unk>
the next time <unk> expansion plans are mentioned at the old company and somebody says aw heck guys nobody can do it like <unk> or <unk> <unk> i wish <unk> you would butt in and say hold it fellas why do n't we compare prices and use our own little <unk> <unk> country
we would even save on freight
there is no mystery why the <unk> originated <unk> the blues

your story is an insult to the citizens of the <unk> <unk>
many of the problems n you presented exist in every part of this country
poverty is only two blocks from <unk> <unk> residence
for years we tried to ignore the problem of poverty and now that it has gotten out of hand it a new crusade for the media and our democratic <unk>
nobody should have to live in such poor conditions as in <unk> <unk> but when you travel to <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> the same problems exist
the only difference is n in those cities the poor are housed in high - rise-project apartments each consisting of one room with rusty pipes called plumbing rodents and cockroaches everywhere and nonworking elevators and with the building patrolled by gangs and drug dealers
many middle - class people would love free food <unk> insurance utilities and rent
then maybe i could stay home and have seven children and watch <unk> <unk> like <unk> in the article instead of having one child and working constantly just to stay above water like so many families in this country

<unk> <unk> is in the midst of cutting back its exploration and production group which finds and develops oil and gas reserves in the <unk> by as much as <unk> as part of a new restructuring of that sector of its business
management advised employees <unk> that it was going to reduce employment in production operations of the group by <unk> or n people
the exploration side of the unit has recently undergone a similar overhaul during which it also lost as many as n employees a company spokesman said n in response to questions
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the group involved currently has a work force of somewhat less than n
a few years ago <unk> restructured the entire company during an industrywide shakeout
but since then <unk> oil production has declined and <unk> wants to focus its oil - finding efforts overseas
<unk> alluded to the work - force cuts last week when it took a n million charge as part of its third - quarter earnings and attributed it to a restructuring
<unk> officials said that it is unlikely n any additional charges related to this move will be taken in future quarters
on <unk> <unk> will begin offering separation packages and voluntary retirement in its <unk> production operation
<unk> officials said n they have been studying ways of streamlining these operations since early this year
during the coming months layers of management will be peeled away and regional offices will become more autonomous
for greater efficiency employees at those locations will be reorganized into teams responsible for managing the properties under their jurisdiction <unk> said n
the main feature of the new organization is that each local manager will have both the authority and accountability for profitable and technically sound operations said <unk> <unk> <unk> president of the <unk> unit
field offices at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> will be maintained
but the staffs at some of those locations will be slashed while at others the work force will be increased
for instance employment in <unk> will be reduced to <unk> from <unk>
but on the <unk> <unk> where profitable oil production is more likely than in the midcontinent region the <unk> <unk> office staff of <unk> will grow by <unk> to n
the reorganization will focus on the value and potential of assets <unk> <unk> said <unk>
wanted an investment that as simple and secure as a certificate of deposit but offers a return worth getting excited about
with <unk> billion of cds maturing this month a lot of people have been scouring the financial landscape for just such an investment
in <unk> when many of them bought their cds six - month certificates were yielding more than <unk> investors willing to look could find double - digit yields at some banks and thrifts
now the nationwide average yield on a six - month cd is just under <unk> and <unk> is about the best around
but investors looking for alternatives are n't finding it easy
yields on most fixed - income securities are lower than several months ago
and the stock market recent gyrations are a painful reminder of the dangers there
if you looking for a significantly higher yield with the same level of risk as a cd you not going to find it says <unk> financial planner <unk> <unk> <unk>
there are however some alternatives that income - oriented investors should consider investment advisers say n
short - term municipal bonds bond funds and tax - deferred annuities are some of the choices n they mention and not just as a way n to get a higher return
in particular advisers say n investors may want to look at securities that reduce the risk that <unk> holders are confronting right now of having to reinvest the proceeds of maturing short - term certificates at lower rates
a mix of cds and other holdings may make the most sense
people should remember <unk> their money is n't all or nothing they do n't need to be shopping for the one interest - rate-type investment and putting all their money in it says <unk> <unk> adviser <unk> <unk>
here a look at some of the alternatives
short - term municipals
investors with a heavy tax load should take out their calculators
yields on municipal bonds can be higher than after - tax yields on cds for maturities of perhaps one to five years
that because municipal - bond interest is exempt from federal income tax and from state and local taxes too for in - state investors
for an investor paying tax at a n rate a seemingly puny n yield on a one - year muni is equivalent to a taxable n
rates approach n on five - year municipals
some of the more cautious <unk> holders might like pre - refunded municipals
these securities get top credit ratings because the issuers have put aside <unk> bonds that will be sold to pay off holders when the municipals are retired
it a no - brainer you do n't have to worry about diversification you do n't have to worry about quality says <unk> <unk> <unk> executive vice president of the <unk> <unk> bond firm of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
consider a laddered bond portfolio with issues maturing in say n n and <unk> advises <unk> <unk> a. <unk> a <unk> <unk> financial planner
the idea is to have money rolling over each year at prevailing interest rates
bond funds
bond mutual funds offer diversification and are easy n to buy and sell
that makes them a reasonable option for investors who will accept some risk of price fluctuation in order to make a bet that interest rates will decline over the next year or so
buyers can look forward to double - digit annual returns if they are right
but they will have disappointing returns or even losses if interest rates rise instead
bond resale prices and thus fund share prices move in the opposite direction from rates
the price movements get bigger as the maturity of the securities lengthens
consider for instance two bond funds from <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> . that were both yielding n on a recent day
the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with an average maturity of <unk> <unk> years would deliver a total return for one year of about <unk> if rates drop one percentage point and a one - year return of about <unk> if rates rise by the same amount
but in the same circumstances the returns would be a more extreme <unk> and <unk> for the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with its <unk> <unk> average maturity
you get equity - like returns from bonds if you guess right on rates says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> planner
if interest rates do n't change bond fund investors returns will be about equal to the funds current yields
deferred <unk>
these insurance company contracts feature some of the same tax benefits and restrictions as non - deductible individual retirement accounts <unk> gains are compounded without tax consequences until money is withdrawn but a n penalty tax is imposed on withdrawals made before age n n
aimed specifically at <unk> holders are so - called cd - type annuities or certificates of annuity
an interest rate is guaranteed for between one and seven years after which holders get <unk> days <unk> to choose another guarantee period or to switch to another insurer contract without the surrender charges that are common to annuities
some current rates exceed those on cds
for instance a <unk> - type annuity from <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> offers n interest for one year or a n rate for two years
annuities are rarely a good idea at age n because of the withdrawal restrictions
but at age n they may be a great deal says <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> planner
money market funds
that right money market mutual funds
the conventional wisdom is to go into money funds when rates are rising and shift out at times such as the present when rates seem headed down
with average maturities of a month or so money funds offer fixed share prices and floating returns that track market interest rates with a slight lag
still today highest - yielding money funds may beat cds over the next year even if rates fall says <unk> <unk> <unk> an editor of the <unk> <unk> <unk> newsletter in <unk>
that because top - yielding funds currently offer yields almost <unk> n percentage points above the average cd yield
<unk> <unk> likes the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a seven - day compound yield just under n
a new fund its operating expenses are being temporarily subsidized by the sponsor
try combining a money fund and an intermediate - term bond fund as a low - risk bet on falling rates suggests <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a mutual fund unit of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
if rates unexpectedly rise the increasing return on the money fund will partly offset the lower - than-expected return from the bond fund
federal drug regulators concerned over british reports that diabetics have died after shifting from animal to human - based insulin say n they are considering a study <unk> to see if similar deaths have occurred here
the <unk> <unk> reports came from <unk> <unk> <unk> head of clinical chemistry at <unk> <unk> in <unk>
in a telephone interview <unk> <unk> <unk> said n the number of sudden unexplained deaths of diabetics <unk> he had seen this year was n compared with just two in <unk>
at least six of the deaths occurred among relatively young diabetics who had switched from animal to human insulin within the past year he said n
<unk> <unk> <unk> director of metabolism and endrocrine drug products for the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> officials have discussed <unk> <unk> findings fairly intensively
while there have been no reports of similar sudden unexplained deaths among diabetics in the <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> the <unk> plans to examine <unk> <unk> evidence and is considering its own study here
<unk> <unk> a toxicologist said <unk> he was preparing an article for a british forensic medical journal raising the possibility that the deaths may have occurred after human insulin blunted critical warning signs indicating hypoglycemia or low blood sugar which can kill diabetics
the usual warning signs of hypoglycemia include sweating anxiety and cramps
with proper warning diabetics can easily raise their blood sugar to safe levels by eating sugar or sugary food
the anecdotal data certainly shows that some of the people were not aware of the rapid onset of hypoglycemia <unk> <unk> said
at the <unk> <unk> institutes of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> chief of the diabetes program branch said n no evidence of unexpected deaths from hypoglycemia had shown up in a study of <unk> diabetics that has been under way at <unk> for five years
however he said <unk> officials conducting the study had n't been looking for signs of problems related to hypoglycemia unawareness
we are now monitoring for it much more closely he said
we do know n there are slight differences in the way n human and animal insulins drive down blood sugar <unk> <unk> said
the human - based drug starts the blood sugar dropping sooner and drives it down faster he said n
but we do n't believe n there is enough of a difference to be clinically significant <unk> <unk> said
reports of <unk> <unk> findings in the british press have triggered widespread concern among diabetics there
both the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> on <unk> in <unk> <unk> equivalent of the <unk> <unk> recently issued statements noting the lack of hard scientific evidence n to support <unk> <unk> findings
on <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> issued a similar statement urging the six million <unk> diabetics not to overreact to the british report
a loss of the warning symptoms of hypoglycemia is a complex problem that is very unlikely to be due simply to the type of insulin used the american association said
the <unk> already requires drug manufacturers to include warnings with insulin products that symptoms of hypoglycemia are less pronounced with human insulin than with animal - based products
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> - based drug manufacturer dominates the <unk> human insulin market with its product known as <unk>
<unk> is building plants <unk> to make the insulin in <unk> and <unk> <unk>
in its latest annual report <unk> said <unk> <unk> sales have shown excellent growth
<unk> officials said n they had seen reports of hypoglycemic unawareness among some patients making the shift from animal to human insulin but did n't know if the problem had caused any deaths
<unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> group vice president said <unk> the company clinical trials of both its animal and human - based insulins indicated no difference in the level of hypoglycemia between users of either product
<unk> <unk> said n most of the british diabetics who died had been taking a human - based insulin made by <unk> a danish manufacturer
none of the diabetics were using <unk> insulin
<unk> <unk> said n it will reduce its n work force by about <unk> effective tomorrow in an effort to stem continuing losses
the company which makes data base systems and software said <unk> it expects to report a loss for the third quarter ended <unk> n
defense intellectuals have complained for years that the <unk> can not determine priorities because it has no strategy
last <unk> the new defense secretary <unk> <unk> acknowledged that given an ideal world we have a nice neat orderly process
we do the strategy and then we come around and do the budget
this city does n't work that way
with a five - year defense plan costing more than n trillion it about time n we put together a defense strategy that works in <unk>
this wo n't happen until strategists come down from their ivory tower and learn to work in the real world of limited budgets and uncertain futures
as it is we identify national goals and the threats to these goals we shape a strategy n to counter these threats we determine the forces needed to execute the strategy before finally forging the budgets needed to build and maintain the forces
these procedures consume millions of man - hours of labor and produce tons of paper and each year their end product the five <unk> <unk> <unk> promptly melts away
the graph on the left shows how this happens see accompanying illustration <unk> <unk> n <unk>
compare the past eight five - year plans with actual appropriations
the <unk> strategists produce budgets that simply can not be executed because they assume <unk> a defense strategy depends only on goals and threats
<unk> however is about possibilities not hopes and dreams
by ignoring costs <unk> strategists abdicate their responsibility for hard decisions
that puts the real strategic decisions in the hands of others bean counters budgeteers and pork - barrelers
these people have different agendas
and as a result as the recent vote by the <unk> to undo <unk> <unk> program terminations suggests n the preservation of jobs is becoming the real goal of defense strategy
how can we turn this situation around
reform starts in the <unk>
strategists should consider the impact of budget uncertainties at the beginning of the planning process
they ought to examine how a range of optimistic to pessimistic budget scenarios would change the defense program
they would then develop priorities by identifying the least painful program cuts as they moved from higher to lower budgets
they would also identify the best way n to add programs should the budget come in at higher levels
this kind of contingency analysis is common in war planning and business planning
there is no reason that it can not be done for defense planning
two steps are necessary to translate this idea into action
step n cleans up our books
our five - year plan contains three accounting devices negative money an above guidance management reserve and optimistic inflation estimates which understate the spending n the <unk> has committed itself to by almost n billion
negative money was invented in <unk> to make the <unk> five <unk> <unk> <unk> conform to the numbers in <unk> <unk> final budget submission to <unk>
that plan exceeded the numbers contained in his budget message by n billion
to make the books balance as is required by law somebody invented a new budget line item that simply subtracted n billion
it is known in the <unk> as the negative wedge
the <unk> argues that the negative wedge is the net effect of <unk> billion in the as - yet unidentified procurement reductions that it intends to find in future years and n billion in an above guidance management reserve that accounts for undefined programs that will materialize in the future
the <unk> plan also assumes <unk> inflation will decline to <unk> by n
most forecasters including those in the <unk> <unk> <unk> assume <unk> inflation will be in excess of n in each of those five years
at that rate the defense plan is underfunded by n billion
by adding the negative wedge and recalculating the remaining program using a more probable inflation estimate we arrive at a baseline program costing n trillion between <unk> and <unk>
step n examines how four progressively lower budget scenarios would change the baseline and how these changes would affect our national security
the graph on the right which assumes a n rate of inflation places these scenarios in the context of recent appropriations see accompanying illustration <unk> <unk> n <unk>
note how the baseline program assumes a sharp increase in future appropriations
step <unk> will answer the question what happens if these increases do not materialize
<unk> n known as the <unk> dollar freeze reimburses the <unk> for inflation only it slopes upward at n per year
this scenario has been the rough position of the <unk> <unk> since <unk> and it reduces the baseline by n billion between <unk> and <unk>
scenario n the current dollar freeze has been the approximate position of the <unk> of representatives for about four years
it freezes the budget at its current level and forces the <unk> to eat the effects of inflation until <unk>
this reduces the baseline by n billion
scenario n extends the recent compromises between the <unk> and the <unk> it splits the difference between <unk> <unk> and <unk> by increasing the budget at n per year
it reduces the baseline by n billion
finally <unk> <unk> reduces the budget by n per year for the next five years a total reduction of <unk> billion
this can be thought of as a pessimistic prediction perhaps driven by the sequestering effects of the <unk> - <unk> deficit reduction law or possibly a relaxation of tensions with the <unk> <unk>
the strategic planners in the <unk> chiefs of <unk> would construct the most effective defense program for each scenario maximizing strengths and minimizing weaknesses
they would conclude their efforts by producing a comprehensive net assessment for each plan including the assumptions made an analysis of its deficiencies and limitations the impact on national security and the best strategy for working around these limitations
this exercise would reveal the true cost of a particular program by forcing the strategists to make hard decisions
if for example they choose to keep the <unk> <unk> bomber they would have to sacrifice more and more other programs such as carrier battlegroups or army divisions as they moved toward lower budget levels
these trade - offs would evolve priorities by revealing when the cost of the <unk> became prohibitive
some may be tempted to argue that the idea of a strategic review merely resurrects the infamous <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> concept of the <unk> administration
but <unk> did not involve the strategic planners in the <unk> chiefs of <unk> and therefore degenerated into a bean - counting drill driven by budget politics
anyway <unk> procedures were so cumbersome that everyone involved was crushed under a burden of marginalia
a strategic review is fundamentally different
it would be run by the joint chiefs under simple directions produce the best possible force for each budget scenario and provide the <unk> of <unk> with a comprehensive net assessment of how that force could be used to achieve <unk> goals
it might be feared that even thinking about lower budgets will hurt national security because the door will be opened to opportunistic budget cutting by an irresponsible <unk>
this argument plays well in the atmosphere of gaming and mistrust permeating the <unk> and <unk> and unfortunately there is some truth to it
but in the end it must be rejected for logical as well as moral reasons
to say that the <unk> should act irresponsibly because acting responsibly will provoke <unk> into acting irresponsibly leads to the conclusion that the <unk> should deliberately exaggerate its needs in the national interest in other words that it is justified in committing a crime lying to <unk> because it is morally superior
<unk> is not a game between the <unk> and <unk> it is the art of the possible in a world where constraints force us to choose between unpleasant or imperfect alternatives
if we want meaningful priorities we must understand the trade - offs n they imply before we make commitments
<unk> is not a separate event in an idealized sequence of discrete events it is a way of thinking that neutralizes threats to our interests in a manner consistent with our financial cultural and physical limitations
<unk> <unk> is a permanent <unk> official
this is a condensed version of an essay that will appear in the <unk> issue of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
the views expressed do not reflect the official policy of the <unk> of <unk>
although bullish dollar sentiment has fizzled many currency analysts say n a massive sell - off probably wo n't occur in the near future
while <unk> <unk> tough times and lower <unk> interest rates continue to undermine the dollar weakness in the pound and the yen is expected to offset those factors
by default the dollar probably will be able to hold up pretty well in coming days says <unk> <unk> <unk> - <unk> a foreign - exchange adviser at <unk> <unk>

the pound strengthened to <unk> from <unk>
in <unk> <unk> the <unk> currency opened for trading at <unk> yen down from <unk> <unk> close of <unk> yen
the dollar began <unk> on a firm note gaining against all major currencies in <unk> dealings and early european trading despite reports that the <unk> of <unk> was seen unloading dollars around <unk> yen
the rise came as traders continued to dump the pound after the sudden resignation <unk> of british <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
but once the pound steadied with help from purchases by the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> the dollar was dragged down traders say n by the stock - market slump that left the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a loss of <unk> points
with the stock market wobbly and dollar buyers discouraged by signs of <unk> economic weakness and the recent decline in <unk> interest rates that has diminished the attractiveness of dollar - denominated investments traders say <unk> the dollar is still in a precarious position
they be looking at levels n to sell the dollar says <unk> <unk> a foreign - exchange marketing representative at <unk> of <unk>
while some analysts say <unk> the dollar eventually could test support at n marks and n yen <unk> <unk> and others do n't see the currency decisively sliding under support at n marks and n yen soon
predictions for limited dollar losses are based largely on the pound weak state after <unk> <unk> resignation and the yen inability to strengthen substantially when there are dollar retreats
with the pound and the yen lagging behind other major currencies you do n't have a confirmation that a sharp dollar downturn is in the works says <unk> <unk> <unk> senior currency analyst at <unk> <unk> in <unk>
as far as the pound goes some traders say n a slide toward support at <unk> may be a favorable development for the dollar this week
while the pound has attempted to stabilize currency analysts say n it is in critical condition
sterling plunged about four cents <unk> and hit the week low of n when <unk> <unk> resigned from his six - year post because of a policy squabble with other cabinet members
he was succeeded by <unk> <unk> who <unk> expressed a desire for a firm pound and supported the relatively high british interest rates that he said are working exactly as intended in reducing inflation
but the market remains uneasy about <unk> <unk> policy strategy and the prospects for the pound currency analysts contend n
although the <unk> of <unk> tight monetary policy has fueled worries that <unk> slowing economy is headed for a recession it is widely believed that <unk> <unk> willingness to prop up the pound with interest - rate increases helped stem pound selling in recent weeks
if there are any signs that <unk> <unk> will be less inclined to use interest - rate boosts to rescue the pound from another plunge that currency is expected to fall sharply
it fair to say n there are more risks for the pound under major than there were under <unk> says <unk> <unk> a director of international bond market research at <unk> <unk> in <unk>
there very little upside to sterling <unk> <unk> says but he adds that near - term losses may be small because the selling wave that followed <unk> <unk> appointment apparently has run its course
but some other analysts have a stormier forecast for the pound particularly because <unk> inflation is hovering at a relatively lofty annual rate of about <unk> and the nation is burdened with a struggling government and large current account and trade deficits
the pound likely will fall in coming days and may trade as low as n marks within the next year says <unk> <unk> <unk> an international economist at <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>
the pound was at n marks late <unk> off sharply from <unk> in <unk> <unk> trading a week earlier
if the pound falls closer to n marks the <unk> of <unk> may raise <unk> base lending rate by one percentage point to <unk> says <unk> <unk> <unk>
but such an increase he says n could be viewed by the market as too little too late
the <unk> of <unk> indicated its desire to leave its monetary policy unchanged <unk> by declining to raise the official <unk> discount - borrowing rate that it charges discount houses analysts say n
pound concerns aside the lack of strong buying interest in the yen is another boon for the dollar many traders say n
the dollar has a natural base of support around <unk> yen because the japanese currency has n't been purchased heavily in recent weeks says <unk> <unk> <unk> - <unk> of <unk> <unk>
the yen softness she says n apparently stems from japanese investors interest in buying dollars against the yen to purchase <unk> bond issues and persistent worries about this year upheaval in the japanese government

while asian markets struggled to cope with the uncertainty caused by the <unk> n plunge in <unk> <unk> stock prices futures trading in <unk> <unk> was relatively heavy and went smoothly
that was also the case in the days following the <unk> <unk> massacre in <unk> which caused a sharp drop in <unk> <unk> stock prices
there was no problem at all says <unk> <unk> chief executive officer of the futures exchange
most important to the contract success is the commitment of <unk> <unk> big financial institutions especially the two leaders <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the local subsidiary of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the two big banks were instrumental in designing the new contract
if those two banks are there then the balance of the banking institutions will be there says <unk> <unk> the securities and futures <unk> official
colony banks have a major stake in how interest rates move because of their enormous <unk> <unk> - dollar exposure
even though the currency is pegged to the <unk> dollar with a fixed exchange rate of <unk> $ n to the american currency the <unk> and <unk> <unk> economies do n't always move in lock step making it difficult to predict where interest rates in the colony will go
in early n when the three - month <unk> rate was between <unk> and <unk> the three - month <unk> rate was as low as n
just a few months ago the three - month <unk> rate was around n while three - month <unk> hit highs above n
the <unk> contract solves quite a bit of the problem of interest - rate risk in the interbank market says <unk> <unk> a director of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> arm of the british brokerage firm
despite the initial support expected trading in the contract is likely to start slowly
the wounds from the <unk> crash have n't yet healed and not all claims against the exchange clearinghouse by those who bet n the <unk> <unk> index would fall have been settled
companies and financial institutions familiar with <unk> <unk> remain wary of trading in its futures market
and <unk> <unk> cautions that there may be limits on how much the contract can grow because the <unk> <unk> dollar is n't a widely traded currency
he says <unk> the contract will be considered a success if it starts trading n to n lots a day
exchange officials also point out that <unk> futures were designed for institutions and corporations not for the type of small individual investors who were very active in <unk> <unk> index futures and defaulted in the <unk> crash
<unk> <unk> says <unk> the low margin required for trading futures attracted a lot of small investors before the <unk> crash who did n't realize that their risk was virtually unlimited
you not going to get your taxi drivers and amahs and all that says <unk> <unk> a director for securities company elders <unk> <unk> <unk>

when the going gets tough it tough to trade stocks in continental <unk>
that the troubling conclusion reached by many international investors and money managers angry at the malfunctions on continental stock exchanges during last week global market turbulence
they say n the recent market volatility has underscored the shortcomings of the way n many european exchanges trade stocks
the weaknesses of <unk> exchanges are driving some fund managers to switch business to stocks traded on <unk> stock exchange which quotes firm trading prices for about n blue - chip issues from <unk> major countries
i not saying <unk> <unk> covered itself in glory but the events of the past week have certainly exposed <unk> weaknesses says <unk> <unk> a director of <unk> <unk> <unk> managers in <unk> <unk> which manages about <unk> billion n billion in institutional money
he says n the problems on european exchanges included market - system breakdowns delayed execution of buy and sell orders and trading suspensions
the events strengthen <unk> hand in becoming the center for trading european stocks <unk> <unk> says
unable to unload a large block of a french blue - chip company shares in <unk> for two days last week a frustrated <unk> <unk> fund manager finally tossed down her phone in disgust and called <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> brokerage firm
the firm did the trade in seconds on the <unk> stock exchange <unk> automated - quotation system
on so - called <unk> <unk> <unk> n stock prices plunged across <unk> and trading problems erupted
<unk> had some problems too
the <unk> exchange electronic price - reporting system provided only indicative or non - firm prices for about n minutes on <unk> <unk>
some dealers say n other traders were n't picking up their phones

it was a nightmare says <unk> <unk> an investment manager at <unk> <unk> holdings <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> unit in <unk>
it very worrying that these markets ca n't cope
on <unk> <unk> the volume of german shares traded in <unk> more than tripled to n million and the volume of french shares rose n
by comparison german domestic stock volume in <unk> only doubled that day
the switch to the <unk> market during such turbulent times is significant
for one thing the size of the affected market is enormous the european stock markets account for some n of global stock market capitalization with an estimated value of n trillion according to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the continental markets alone contribute about <unk> of estimated world market capitalization of n trillion
though the widely traded shares that are quoted in <unk> account for only a small portion of those totals they still are the most closely watched stocks and are often viewed as a barometer for the local markets generally
the switch to <unk> underscores the fact that despite the economic restructuring associated with <unk> <unk> efforts to develop a single market by n european stock trading remains a highly fragmented and very localized activity
against this backdrop one thing that does n't seem likely to result from <unk> is a single european stock market
rather there increasingly is a group of international brokerage and trading firms that operate in most european financial centers including european giants such as <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> as well as <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> securities <unk>
these firms which often have acquired a local brokerage firm are calling the shots when it comes to deciding in which market to transact a trade

but it just one of those things that happened
investors can be assured now that this kind of problem can never occur again
but for others the pledges echo the promises made after the <unk> stock crash when similar problems led many markets to develop the new systems that performed so badly last week
they all said <unk> they invested huge amounts of money
but they either did n't buy the right machines or they wasted it says <unk> <unk> <unk>

<unk> <unk> employers fear that the <unk> <unk> plans for a charter of fundamental social rights is a danger to industrial competitiveness
we do n't want <unk> deciding conditions for workers unless they are necessary and useful said <unk> <unk> secretary general of the employers confederation <unk>
<unk> an acronym for the <unk> of <unk> and employers confederations of <unk> fears that the charter will force <unk> countries to adopt a single pattern in labor relations
workers and management <unk> <unk> said <unk> would lose the flexibility and diversity that has so far allowed them to adapt to local conditions and traditions
the british government also strongly opposes the charter in its current form
it argues as does <unk> that labor relations are best left to be regulated at the national level
<unk> will propose a slightly watered - down version of the charter n to be discussed by <unk> social - affairs ministers on <unk> officials said n
but the cosmetic changes are n't expected to win over <unk>
we still have serious differences with the text a british official said because it provides for a regulation of the labor market
<unk> <unk> said <unk> the charter would put poorer <unk> countries such as <unk> <unk> and <unk> at a disadvantage
it would force these countries to introduce minimum standards for pay and working hours and provide for collective bargaining and worker participation in major corporate decisions
this he warned <unk> would prevent these countries from bridging the difference with their richer <unk> brethren
indeed lower wages in <unk> they are a third of the <unk> average are n't enough to offset higher transport costs and lower productivity in the southern countries
increasing labor costs <unk> <unk> argued n would only put the countries at a further disadvantage in competing in the barrier - free <unk> market planned for after <unk>
but the <unk> official said that producing a charter acceptable to both <unk> and european industry is n't an unattainable goal
the charter would just have to be restricted to a list of workers fundamental rights without seeking to impose any norms
a key provision in the current version of the charter would give the commission a mandate <unk> to produce an action program detailing on what points <unk> member states would be required to comply with the goals set out in the charter
this provision lies at the heart of the british and <unk> fears of social engineering by the commission
one possible political solution an <unk> official said <unk> would be for the commission to present the action program in late <unk> before the adoption of the charter at a summit of <unk> governments on <unk> <unk> and <unk>
this would leave <unk> free to adopt the charter after having rebutted the action program

after a three - year nightmare of uncertain oil prices draconian budget cuts and sweeping layoffs fear is finally leaving the oil patch
independent drillers are gingerly sinking bits into the earth crust again
some in big oil are easing the grip on their wallets
investment capital is creeping back and oil properties are fetching more
oil - tool prices are even edging up
what happened
in broadest terms stability has quietly settled into international oil markets
mideast politics have calmed down and the squabbling within the <unk> of <unk> <unk> countries seems under control for now
the fundamentals of supply and demand once again are setting oil prices says <unk> <unk> an <unk> <unk> <unk> oil expert
after years of wild swings oil prices over the last n months have settled at around <unk> to n a barrel
that is n't the n that delighted producers a decade ago or the n that pleased users a year ago
but it is high enough to prod the search for future supplies low enough to promote consumption and most important steady enough for both producers and users to believe in
not that oil suddenly is a sure thing again
the current equilibrium is fragile and depends on steady strong demand and continued relative harmony within <unk> producer of more than <unk> of the non - communist world crude
a recession or new <unk> blowup could put oil markets right back in the soup
also the new stirrings are faint and some question their extent
drilling activity is still far below eight years ago there no hiring surge and some companies continue to shrink
with all this even the most wary oil men agree <unk> something has changed
it does n't appear to be getting worse
that in itself has got to cause people to feel a little more optimistic says <unk> <unk> the president of <unk> <unk> <unk>
though modest the change reaches beyond the oil patch too
the same roller - coaster prices that halted <unk> oil exploration and drove many veteran oil men and companies out of the business also played havoc with the nation inflation rate the trade deficit and oil users corporate and personal budgets
now at least some predictability has returned for everyone from economists to motorists
corporate planners can plan again
management does n't want surprises notes <unk> <unk> who as fuel - services director at <unk> <unk> buys some n billion gallons of jet fuel a year
prices had been so unstable that two years ago <unk> <unk> gave up on long - term forecasts
and consumers should be comfortable adds <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> deputy secretary of energy
i do n't see anything on the horizon that could lead to a precipitous rise in the price
the catalyst for all this has been <unk>
about a year ago it ended an on - again off - again internal production war that had put prices on a roller coaster and pitched oil towns from <unk> to <unk> into recession
<unk> <unk> <unk> kingpin abandoned a policy of flooding the market to punish quota - cheaters
about the same time the <unk> - <unk> war which was roiling oil markets ended
in addition global petroleum demand has been climbing
it is projected to keep growing by a million barrels a day or up to <unk> annually for years <unk> to come
for <unk> that ideal
the resulting firm prices and stability will allow both producers and consumers to plan confidently says saudi arabian <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> - <unk> <unk> explains consumers offer security of markets while <unk> provides security of supply
this is an opportune time n to find mutual ways <unk> to prevent price shocks from happening again he says
to promote this balance <unk> now is finally confronting a long - simmering internal problem
at its <unk> meeting it will try to revise its quotas to satisfy <unk> <unk> members that can produce far more oil than their allotments
being held well below capacity greatly irritates them and has led to widespread cheating
<unk> has repeatedly raised its self - imposed production ceiling to legitimize some of that unauthorized output
oil ministers now hope to solve the issue for good through an iranian proposal that gives a larger share of output to countries with surplus capacity and reduces the shares of those that ca n't produce more anyway
but if they walk out without any effort to resolve their problem production could increase to n million or n million barrels a day making for a very troublesome first quarter warns <unk> <unk> <unk> - <unk> a consultant and former <unk> <unk> delegate
that would send prices plummeting from what some gun - shy <unk> oil executives still regard as too low a level
<unk> <unk> early president of <unk> <unk> oil - production unit says that despite recent stability he plans continued tightening of costs and exploration spending
the view of some others in big oil he maintains n is very much similar to <unk> outlook
just this week <unk> <unk> disclosed new cutbacks in its domestic exploration and production operations

<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a unit of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> bought from <unk> the rights that allowed it to drill the <unk>
a mile and a half away looms the <unk> rig of the <unk> due to be pumping by <unk>
talk is that everybody is going to drill more wells says foreman <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> aims to drill about n wells in this area in <unk> and double that next year
it is more aggressive than most but it is n't the only company with a new attitude as it found when it went looking for a partner for the <unk>
we went to six companies over two days pitching the prospect says <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> exploration manager
five were interested
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> became the partner ponying up more than half of the n in drilling and start - up costs
<unk> will get a half - interest in the oil
a kind of no - mistakes mentality had been stifling activity says <unk> <unk> <unk> oil exploration chief
now everybody is a lot more optimistic
one attraction for oil operators here and in other fields is the bargain - basement cost of drilling and equipment reflecting service companies hunger for work
<unk> <unk> <unk> a small <unk> independent is currently drilling two wells itself and putting money into three others
one of its wells in southwestern <unk> is a rank wildcat a risky well where oil previously has n't been found
at this price <unk> plus or minus and with costs being significantly less than they were several years ago the economics are pretty good says <unk> <unk> head of the company
if you know n you got stability in price you can do things n you would n't do with the volatility of the past few years
the activity is enough to move some oil - service prices back up a little
some drill - bit prices have risen <unk> in the past month
in the <unk> of <unk> a boat n to deliver supplies to offshore rigs now costs around <unk> a day up nearly n since <unk>
some service boats recently were auctioned for about n million each up from less than n million two years ago
at the bottom of the slump <unk> <unk> was discounting <unk> on an electronic evaluation of a well now it discounts about n drillers say <unk>
still there is money n to be made
most oil companies when they set exploration and production budgets for this year forecast revenue of <unk> for each barrel of crude produced
prices have averaged more than <unk> a barrel higher than that not a windfall but at least a pleasant bonus for them
so according to a <unk> <unk> <unk> survey companies that had been refusing to spend even their very conservative budgets may loosen up before year end
it says <unk> <unk> of those surveyed report that <unk> exploration spending will exceed n
funds for drilling may inch up more next year if oil prices stay stable
<unk> thinking in terms of <unk> oil for <unk> may raise spending especially for low - risk prospects an official says <unk>
outside investors scarce since n are edging back
although it still difficult to raise money for a pure wildcat program says <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> official in <unk> institutions are starting to see n there are cycles to these things and this one is beginning to turn
<unk> <unk> generally likes the industry again
the appetite for oil - service stocks has been especially strong although some got hit yesterday when <unk> <unk> <unk> cut its short - term investment ratings on them
contractors such as <unk> <unk> <unk> are raising cash again through stock offerings and for the first time in years two oil - service companies recently went public
they are <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>
most oil companies are still reluctant to add to the office and professional staffs n they slashed so deeply
but a few new spots are opening
<unk> <unk> the accounting firm has increased its energy staff n in a year
out in the oil fields if activity picks up much more shortages could appear because so many roughnecks roustabouts and others left after the crash
already it hard to get people
they so busy says one <unk> <unk> drilling foreman here
for most field workers it about time
<unk> <unk> who arrived late at the <unk> with his crew because he had started early in the morning setting up tanks at another site just got the first raise n he can remember in eight years to n an hour from <unk>
<unk> <unk> a mud - logger at the <unk> well has worked all but about nine days of this year
last year i was off a straight month then one time for two to three weeks and another two to three weeks he says n
<unk> <unk> who sells oil - field equipment for <unk> <unk> <unk> is also busy
a native of the area he is back now after riding the oil - field boom to the top then surviving the bust running an <unk> <unk> convenience store
first year <unk> i came back there was n't any work he says
i think n it on the way back now
but it wo n't be a boom again
no major booms no major setbacks he predicts
business has been good enough that he just took a spur - of-the-moment weekend trip to the mountain area of <unk> something <unk> i have n't done in years
the figures confirm that there certainly is n't any drilling boom
only n wells including n dry holes were drilled for oil and natural gas in the <unk> in the first nine months of the year down n from the like n period
but that was off less than at midyear when completions lagged by n
and the number of rigs active in the <unk> is inching up
according to <unk> <unk> <unk> n rotary rigs were at work in the <unk> last week up from the year - ago count of <unk>
in <unk> before the bust the rig count was above n

<unk> <unk> a brewing property media and resources concern controlled by financier <unk> <unk> is selling many of its assets to reduce an <unk> n billion debt
contrary to what might be expected based on the headline on <unk> <unk> <unk> recent money matters article pros hit theorists right where it hurts <unk> n i was able to stand proudly before my undergraduate finance students and proclaim that the findings of your yearlong experiment on stock picking is completely consistent with what they have been taught in the classroom
in particular i do not find the fact that your group of pros monthly selections of four stocks outperforms the market in general to be inconsistent with market efficiency
<unk> <unk> states that an investor who invested n a year ago in the first four stocks selected by your pros and then sold those one month later purchasing the four new pro picks and repeated this process for the year would have accumulated <unk> excluding account dividends taxes and commissions
in contrast an investor holding the <unk> <unk> portfolio over the year would have accumulated only <unk>
accepted theories of asset pricing offer a perfectly legitimate explanation
accepted theories state that investors require higher returns on riskier investments
thus rather than seeing the excess returns to the pro - selected portfolio as being abnormal i see those returns as simply compensations for taking on added risk
i believe n the risk for each individual stock selected by your pros is very large
if you asked me to select a stock with the highest expected return i would select a stock with the greatest amount of undiversifiable risk as i am sure n your pros do
your hypothetical investor is simply being compensated for taking on this added risk
moreover your hypothetical investor has forsaken the gains n to be had in reducing risk by diversifying his portfolio
a four - stock portfolio is still exposed to a great deal of unnecessary risk
this means n the returns can vary a great deal
<unk> <unk> provides confirming evidence of this phenomenon when he reports that your staff of dart throwers would have accumulated only <unk> by randomly selecting four new stocks <unk> to be held in a portfolio each month
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> your investment dartboard article misses the target
the fact that stock pickers have bested a randomly selected portfolio in eight of n months has no bearing on the efficient - market theory
what matters is that the stocks recommended by your pros tend to be substantially riskier than a diversified portfolio
for example your pickers recommendations for the coming month are on average n riskier than holding the market portfolio according to <unk> <unk> <unk> estimates
<unk> <unk> pick for <unk> <unk> is a substantial n riskier than the market portfolio his lauded <unk> <unk> pick is n riskier

in recent months more than n agencies have been robbed compared with only a handful all last year according to police and travel - agency groups
most of the cases have been in <unk> where one agent was stabbed and another was shot and killed
<unk> <unk> police say n the thieves seem to be part of a crime network that knows how to convert blank tickets into real ones
already the stolen tickets have been used for flights all over the world
so far the thieves have stolen <unk> blank tickets according to <unk> <unk> <unk> a ticket processing center
police say n the robberies are usually pulled off by two to five men who walk into the agencies near closing or lunch time when few employees are there
they looked like ordinary vacationers at first says <unk> <unk> owner of <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> describing five men who entered his agency last <unk>
but then he says n they put two loaded pistols to his temple and demanded n he open the safe

the robberies also have set off a controversy involving the airlines

texans get reasonable car rental
consumer advocates have long claimed that car rental companies charge too much for car rental insurance
now a new law in <unk> seems to be providing the proof
the law the first of its kind requires car rental companies in <unk> to charge only reasonable rates for collision - damage waiver insurance
specifically the law says <unk> the rates must closely reflect what the company actual expenses have been to replace damaged cars
before the law went into effect last month car rental companies were charging as much as <unk> a day for the waiver in <unk>
now they charging as little <unk> a day
if they telling the truth now then they been charging n more than what is reasonable says <unk> <unk> an assistant state attorney general in <unk>
a spokesman for <unk> <unk> acknowledges the waiver is n't a source of protection for consumers but a source of revenue
but <unk> points out that at least it now charging only n a day in <unk> while some competitors are charging <unk>

flight attendants lag before jets even
if your flight attendant seems a little weary it may be because he or she has been working <unk> straight hours
a recent study for the <unk> <unk> <unk> found that major airlines sometimes make flight attendants work n hours or more straight despite union contracts at some airlines limiting duty time to n hours
some flight attendants on charter planes are putting in n work days the study found <unk>
this happens because the <unk> does n't have any rules on duty time for flight attendants by contrast it strictly restricts duty time for pilots and air traffic controllers usually to a maximum of <unk> consecutive hours
as far as the <unk> is concerned says <unk> <unk> air safety director at the <unk> of <unk> attendants flight attendants can work an unlimited number of hours
experts say <unk> such long hours for attendants pose a safety risk
for instance tired flight attendants might not react quickly enough during an emergency evacuation
at the end of their day they are zombies says <unk> <unk> president of the <unk> <unk> <unk> a public - interest group in <unk> <unk>
they have to work such long hours and then we expect them to be heroes if there an evacuation
in response to the study the <unk> says n it is considering changing its policy or lack of it on flight attendants
the agency may not have much choice a congressional bill has been introduced that would force the agency to limit flight attendant duty time to n hours on <unk> flights and n hours on international trips

why do you continually ignore the salubrious effects of indexing the basis of capital gains for inflation
why do you maintain <unk> the <unk> - passed capital - gains plan is a temporary reduction when it is not
i think n the reason is that you are confusing tax rates with tax payments
your <unk> n page - one story on the <unk> - passed capital - gains plan is a good example
you lead readers to believe that the <unk> reduced the capital - gains tax for two years only
you virtually ignore the tax - reducing power of indexation which in many cases is more substantial than a lower rate
the monetary tax benefit of indexation for all gains in excess of inflation can be measured using the following equation tax rate times inflation rate times basis for the gain
depending on the size of the gain and the rate of inflation indexation can mean a lower tax payment than using the <unk> rate without indexation
but in any event and this is the important point tax payments on capital gains will be lower with indexation than under current law even though the tax rate is the same under both systems
as you can see the capital - gains reduction plan adopted by the <unk> would not be temporary but permanent
i hope that you begin talking about the plan permanent and in my view most beneficial feature indexation
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
that the motivation for the two - year reduction to <unk> is budgetary does not mean <unk> it is not in the public interest
the reduction eases the burden on portfolio changes and frees capital to seek more productive or more appropriate uses
but what is really significant is the indexation of capital gains after n
to argue that this is not likely to affect the economy in positive ways is contrary both to recent experience with capital - gains tax cuts and to common sense
a large part of the long - term appreciation of assets reflects inflation and the taxation of inflation - created capital gains is confiscation
does the <unk> really believe that people ignore the prospect of having a substantial part of their capital confiscated when they decide whether to save or how to invest
under current law it is not financially rational to forgo consumption
real aftertax returns from financial assets are on the order of <unk> or <unk> a year
the capital - gains tax reform is a step toward correcting one of the gravest structural weaknesses of the <unk> economy the closely connected phenomena of low savings rates weak capital formation and high capital costs

but the chief rule - making body for accountants backed off one part of its original proposal made earlier this year that would have required a breakdown of certain balance - sheet items related to off - balance sheet instruments
the balance - sheet detail was opposed by many banks and thrifts that felt n the cost of supplying such data was n't worth the value of the disclosures
under the initial proposal for example banks would have been required to disclose that portion of allowances for loan losses that reflects specific letters of credit for which customers had defaulted
the final rule wo n't require such a breakdown of the allowances for loan losses which appears on the balance sheet
the <unk> rule will cover such financial instruments as interest rate swaps financial guarantees foward interest rate contracts loan contracts loan commitments and options written on securites held
it will require companies to spell out in more detail collateral polices and concentrations of credit risk for all financial instruments
the rule will require companies with financial instruments that have off - balance sheet risks to disclose data about the value and terms of the instruments any accounting loss that would occur if the outside party involved in the instrument failed to perform and the company policy for requiring collateral or other security for the instrument

a potentially safer whooping cough vaccine made by novel genetic engineering techniques was described by a team of italian <unk> and japanese scientists
the team reported <unk> they managed to induce bacteria to produce a non - toxic version of the poisons produced by the bacterium that causes whooping cough
laboratory tests showed that non - toxic versions of the poisons are capable of inducing an immunity to whooping cough the researchers reported n in this week issue of the journal <unk>
the current vaccine for whooping cough or pertussis is part of the <unk> for <unk> pertussis tetanus shot given most infants and young children
the vaccine is effective in preventing a disease that still afflicts about n million children a year world - wide causing an estimated one million deaths
the vaccine however causes allergic reactions that can be fatal
the reactions stem from the fact that the vaccine contains multiple copies of the whole <unk> pertussis bacterium which causes whooping cough
this bacterium produces a toxin that if used as a vaccine can induce immunity to whooping cough
unfortunately the toxin is also poisonous
the italian - led scientific team said <unk> they had succeeded in getting bacteria to produce a non - toxic version of the pertussis toxin which could be used as a safe vaccine
the researchers reported n they have been able to pluck the five genes that produced the toxin out of the pertussis bacterium
it turned out that although it took all five genes to produce the toxin only one was responsible for the toxin virulence
ordinarily in genetic engineering each of these genes minus the one that caused the virulence would have been transferred to another bacterium called <unk> coli which would then produce a nonvirulent version of the toxin
the researchers said <unk> they did this but the toxin did n't induce immunity to whooping cough
the scientists then took the five toxin genes and triggered a mutation in the one gene that caused virulence
then using a new technique called homologous recombination for introducing genes into cells they transferred all five genes to bacteria closely related to the pertussis organism
these bacterial cousins ordinarily do n't make the toxin
but the genes were accompanied by a piece of <unk> called a promoter that turns the genes on
the new bacteria recipients of the genes began producing pertussis toxin which because of the mutant virulence gene was no longer toxic
experiments showed that the new non - virulent toxin is capable of inducing immunity according to the researchers from the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> of <unk> in <unk> and the <unk> <unk> institutes of <unk>

at a time when foreign banks are pouring vast resources and personnel into <unk> <unk> financial center the opening of a three - man office on a <unk> side street should n't attract much attention
unless of course it happens to be run by the rothschilds
after an n absence from the birthplace of the family banking empire the return of the <unk> group to <unk> was greeted by the glare of television lights curious reporters and a mayoral reception in <unk> <unk>
like other foreign banks establishing a presence here the family describes its move as a calculated decision to set up a financial services outlet in <unk> largest economy ahead of the integration of <unk> <unk> markets after n
yet the rothschilds do n't deny an emotional element to the decision
in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> founded <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and later sent his four sons to <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to begin the bank expansion during the early n century
the original bank in <unk> closed in n after the death of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the family banking activities focused on <unk> and <unk>
<unk> <unk> de <unk> the family elder spokesman explains that by the end of the <unk> century <unk> had replaced <unk> as <unk> financial center
yet the chief reason for the closure he says n was rooted in a family tradition that would n't allow a bank to bear the <unk> name without a <unk> in its management
at the time we had only daughters explains the n patriarch so we had to close the bank
much of the family mystique remained
although its palatial residence was destroyed by bombs during <unk> <unk> <unk> the rothschilds place in <unk> history is still recalled by the city park and a street bearing the <unk> name
the family long absence is understandable
the family was in <unk> countries during both <unk> <unk> <unk> and the long period of economic strife of the <unk>
during the <unk> <unk> the rothschilds were a target of nazi propaganda against jewish financiers
the persecution pursued the rothschilds across <unk> as the nazis grabbed countries confiscating the family property in the process
american journalist <unk> <unk> <unk> in his book the rise and fall of the <unk> <unk> wrote of how in <unk> he had witnessed squads of <unk> <unk> men carting off silver tapestries paintings and other loot from the <unk> palace
in the immediate postwar years the rothschilds concentrated on rebuilding their other european operations delaying their return to <unk>
for a member of the <unk> family the return to <unk> is a very meaningful event although it might not mean as much to german banking as it means to us says <unk> <unk> de <unk> <unk> younger cousin and a partner in <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>
indeed the competition is n't greatly concerned
it would be surprising if they did n't come to <unk> in time for <unk> and they bring an interesting tradition
but the market really is n't going to be stood on its head said a banker at one of <unk> <unk> three banks
the return of the rothschilds is modest
the new representative office with one manager and two assistants none a member of the <unk> family will carry out no banking operations of its own
instead it is to seek out corporate financing business and sell investment products on behalf of the family mainstay banking units <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> . in <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>
the constraints do n't bother the office n manager <unk> <unk>
he left his job as general manager of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> office because he says n when the rothschilds called i could n't resist
each <unk> bank is linked by family ties and cross - ownership
in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> in <unk> showed assets of <unk> billion n billion and n billion swiss francs n million respectively
the <unk> bank does n't publish that figure
in <unk> the rothschilds banks are focusing on mergers and acquisitions as european industry restructures ahead of n
yet the group limited resources makes it a niche player
obviously there are quantitative limitations on the assistance n we can provide concedes <unk> <unk> de <unk> but we feel n we have some cards n to play
among them he says <unk> is the family traditional ties to old wealth and decision - makers in banking and industry throughout <unk> and beyond
the rothschilds hope to use a long history in private banking and an aura of exclusivity to attract private and institutional investors
as at the <unk> bank the minimum investment for individuals will be high about a million german marks n three times what many other west german investment banks require
but we do make exceptions says a smiling <unk> <unk> de <unk> especially if they are very young and have very rich parents
as program trading comes under renewed attack for causing stock market gyrations a few people on <unk> <unk> say n it is time n to consider extreme measures
the real answer to curbing wild swings in stock prices they say <unk> might be to curb or even abolish stock - index futures
a stock - index future is a contract to buy or sell the market value of a basket of stocks such as the <unk> <unk> <unk> index
since stock futures were created in <unk> trading on the <unk> <unk> <unk> and other exchanges has boomed to the point where trading in stock - index futures rivals that in the stocks themselves
the conventional view as voiced by <unk> <unk> <unk> partner <unk> <unk> is that stocks and derivatives such as futures and options form a single market and that derivatives make it a more liquid market
but increasingly people are questioning that view and the critics include some of the country most successful investors
<unk> <unk> has been on record as opposing stock - index futures since their inception in <unk>
and <unk> <unk> another star in the investing world says my gut says <unk> the negatives of futures and synthetics far outweigh the benefits
like others <unk> <unk> says that if futures cause investors to lose confidence in stocks they will move away from stocks as many have already done
and those who remain he says <unk> will demand a higher return and over time raise the cost of capital to companies
essentially the critics of stock - index futures fall into two camps
one group says <unk> the futures contribute to stock market volatility the other contends that futures are a sideshow of speculation that detracts from the stock market basic function of raising capital
before futures says <unk> <unk> investor <unk> <unk> you actually had to pay attention to whether the thing n you were buying had any intrinsic value
while it was once expected that futures would mimic stock prices traders now routinely check the futures markets in <unk> before they buy or sell stocks
when <unk> futures prices jump up or down the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> follows
on <unk> for instance the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> plunged n points in little more than an hour
then in the space of a <unk> coffee break the average rallied almost all of the way back
<unk> <unk> who manages more than <unk> billion of investments at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> blames futures markets for leading the way
the fundamentals do n't change in an hour he says
i think n they should close down the futures exchange and then we could get back to investing
index arbitrage the rapid - fire buying and selling of stocks offset with opposite trades in futures is frequently blamed for adding to stock market volatility
although index arbitrage is said to add liquidity to markets <unk> <unk> managing partner of <unk> <unk> <unk> says n too much liquidity is n't a good
the kind of instant liquidity that is implied by index futures is that you can buy a portfolio over two years and get out in one day
it too disruptive he says
it is n't investing
but stock - index futures have plenty of support
defenders say n futures make markets more efficient and provide ways n for investors to reduce risks
they note that stocks experienced volatile swings long before futures
and defenders say n few people complain about futures when stock prices are rising
<unk> <unk> managing director in charge of equity options and futures at <unk> <unk> says that trading baskets of stocks began in the <unk> a decade before the advent of futures
futures he says <unk> merely cut down on trading costs
he says blaming futures is like blaming the messenger
since stock - index arbitrage merely narrows the gap between prices in the futures and stock markets it ca n't add to volatility he says n
futures do n't need defending says <unk> <unk> a spokesman for the <unk> <unk> <unk> which trades the <unk> <unk> by far the largest stock - index futures contract
despite the current outcry over stock market volatility few people expect stock futures to disappear
for one thing the <unk> futures exchanges have political and financial clout including many friends in <unk>
and traders say that futures have become an accepted part of the financial landscape
all life is about change either you adapt or die says one <unk> futures trader
if futures are n't permitted here we take it to <unk> or <unk>
average daily volume in <unk> <unk> futures last year was n contracts

many investment managers say n futures are useful as a way n to hedge portfolios
if managers fear that the overall stock market will fall but want to continue owning stocks they can hold on to specific stocks and sell a corresponding amount of futures contracts

based on yesterday closing price of the <unk> the average value of one day trading amounts to n billion
by contrast average dollar volume on the <unk> <unk> last year was n billion
many investment managers say n futures are useful as a way n to hedge portfolios
if managers fear that the overall stock market will fall but want to continue owning stocks they can hold on to specific stocks and sell a corresponding amount of futures contracts
and although criticism of futures generally comes from <unk> <unk> one <unk> futures trader notes that brokerage firms rely on futures as hedging tools when they buy and sell big blocks of stocks from institutions
one reason n futures are said to add volatility is that unlike in stocks people can speculate in futures with little money down
margin requirements for speculators on the <unk> <unk> <unk> are currently about n
for n million you can move <unk> million of stocks a specialist on the <unk> <unk> gripes
that gives futures traders a lot more power
by contrast an investor in stocks must put up <unk> in cash
some critics say n futures encourage people to think of stocks as a single commodity rather than as investments in individual businesses
thus they say n futures inhibit the basic purpose of the stock market to accurately price securities so that capital and investment flows where it needed most
the <unk> <unk> index futures transferred the identity of <unk> stocks into one unit making them a simple commodity n to trade says <unk> <unk> senior vice president at a. <unk> <unk> in <unk>
it took away the need to know the bad third - quarter report of <unk> for example <unk> <unk> says
of course portfolio trading the increasingly common practice of buying or selling baskets of actual stocks also treats stocks as homogenous commodities
there is a class of investor that wants to be exposed to the whole market says <unk> <unk> assistant vice president at travelers <unk> <unk> <unk>
the <unk> futures are merely a cheaper and quicker way n to get access to all <unk> stocks he says n
the <unk> <unk> yesterday began trading in its own basket trading vehicle representing the <unk> <unk> stocks
but owning index futures is n't the same as owning the underlying stocks
stockholders as a group can win because they own a share of corporate earnings which can grow and boost stock prices
futures on the other hand are a zero sum game a market for making side bets about the direction of stock prices
you do n't own anything says <unk> <unk> a money manager for <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>
you making a pure bet on the market
the <unk> <unk> <unk> challenged an agreement on routes and fares between <unk> two largest airlines on antitrust grounds
meeting in <unk> <unk> the commission voted as expected to formally object to the accord between <unk> <unk> the state - owned airline and state - controlled domestic carrier <unk> <unk>
an <unk> spokesman said n the two companies will be notified so they can begin negotiations with <unk> on how to modify the pact
at issue is an accord dating back to <unk> in which <unk> <unk> gained access to five domestic french routes under <unk> <unk> flight numbers and the domestic airline got to fly to five cities outside of <unk> under the flag of <unk> <unk>
the two shared results from this route swap and followed rules on ticket pricing
the <unk> <unk> decided that such an accord does n't benefit consumers enough to merit an exemption from antitrust law
the airlines presented it as offering consumers more choice and better flight connections
an <unk> <unk> spokeswoman said we absolutely ready to study all solutions
an <unk> <unk> spokesman said because they the <unk> have doubts we will work again on the text and the contents of the accord
a state appellate court reinstated the <unk> convictions of <unk> <unk> <unk> and two of its executives on charges of assault for exposing workers to toxic mercury vapors

the judge handling the case in state <unk> <unk> a trial court had tossed out the jury verdicts ruling that the matter should have been handled under federal <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> rules
but the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> held n that federal law did n't pre - empt the states from such a prosecution

<unk> motors <unk> wants to buy as much as <unk> of <unk> <unk> marking its first salvo in a possible full - scale battle against <unk> <unk> <unk> for control of the british car maker
<unk> sought <unk> antitrust clearance last week to purchase more than n million worth of <unk> shares but does n't own any yet according to <unk> officials here and at the company <unk> headquarters
the no . n <unk> auto maker then wrote <unk> that it intends to go to that <unk> level once it wins the <unk> clearance to go beyond n million a <unk> spokesman said n yesterday
the <unk> move follows <unk> declaration by <unk> which holds an unwelcome <unk> stake in <unk> that it is prepared to bid for the entire company
<unk> is close to completing a friendly deal with <unk> that is likely to involve an eventual <unk> stake and joint manufacturing ventures
speculative investors betting on an imminent clash between <unk> and <unk> pushed up <unk> share price five pence eight <unk> cents to a near - record <unk> pence n in late trading on <unk> stock exchange yesterday
since <unk> the shares have gained nearly n
but an all - out bidding war between the world top auto giants for <unk> leading luxury - car maker seems unlikely

and powerful political pressures may convince the conservative government to keep its so - called golden share which limits any individual holding to <unk> until the restriction expires on <unk> n <unk>
i really do n't see the government doing something that <unk> does n't want over the next <unk> months said <unk> <unk> a conservative member of <unk> and chairman of the <unk> <unk> on <unk> and <unk> in <unk> <unk> of commons
the golden share is a single share but it is the magic share
the government retained the single share after selling its stake in <unk> in <unk> part of a nationalistic practice of protecting former government - owned enterprises to deflect criticism of privatization
the n restriction covers any would - be suitor british or foreign
<unk> is willing to bid for <unk> of <unk> shares if both the government and <unk> shareholders agree to relax the anti - takeover barrier prematurely
as <unk> biggest holder and <unk> biggest car maker <unk> could turn up the heat by convening a special shareholders meeting and urging holders to drop the limits early
<unk> might succeed because many shareholders are speculators keen for a full bid or institutional investors unhappy over <unk> management handling of its current financial difficulties
the government probably would n't give in readily to a hostile foray by <unk> however
it has relinquished a golden share only once before during <unk> <unk> <unk> n billion n billion takeover of <unk> <unk> in <unk>
in wooing british lawmakers <unk> has pointed out that its willingness to settle for a minority stake would keep <unk> <unk> - owned and independent
this week the <unk> auto giant paid for <unk> <unk> of commons members and two <unk> of lords members to fly to <unk> and tour its operations there
while the visit was unrelated to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> answered the legislators questions about it over lunch <unk>
he said <unk> <unk> should n't be smothered by anyone else recalled n one participant
politics also influences the government thinking on the anti - takeover restriction
the conservatives do n't dare jeopardize marginal tory seats in <unk> where <unk> has headquarters nor can the government easily back down on promised protection for a privatized company while it proceeds with controversial plans to privatize most of <unk> water and electricity industries
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> might however be receptive to any request by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for the restriction early removal to let <unk> amass more than <unk> or mount a friendly suitor bid against <unk>
in the end <unk> <unk> rather than the government or <unk> shareholders may hold the key that unlocks the golden share
swedish rolling - steel and ball - bearing group <unk> <unk> said <unk> its pretax profit rose <unk> to n billion kronor n million in the first nine months from one billion kronor n million in the corresponding period a year earlier

earnings per share were n kronor compared with n kronor
<unk> said n demand for the group main product rolling bearings remained favorable in <unk> which accounts for slightly more than two - thirds of group sales
latin american markets continued their recovery after a weak start to the year <unk> said n
the company said <unk> the situation in the <unk> is still uncertain as reduced production in the country automotive industry has resulted in weakened demand for rolling bearings
analysts said <unk> <unk> results for the first nine months lived up to market expectations as brokerage firms had predicted a pretax profit of <unk> billion to n billion kronor
the three business areas engaged in rolling bearing operations continued to show favorable sales development
sales of rolling bearings increased <unk> to n billion kronor from n billion kronor in the corresponding period the previous year
we read with interest <unk> <unk> <unk> n page - one article on <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> gets little respect around <unk>
misunderstanding conversations with us <unk> <unk> argued that <unk> <unk> environmental views are at odds with <unk> residents
this may have been true n years ago but times have changed even in <unk>
<unk> <unk> no longer stands out as an extremist
he has not changed but those around him have
many of his views on the protection of wilderness areas rivers and canyons are now embraced by mainstream conservative utahans
recently some <unk> environmental and outdoor groups representing such divergent points of view as the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> voters and the <unk> <unk> <unk> joined together to request a reassessment of the environmentally unsound <unk> <unk> <unk>
while <unk> is not yet a haven for environmentalism public views toward the environment have significantly improved
in one of the most conservative republican states in the entire nation the greening of <unk> <unk> neighbors is the real story that <unk> <unk> missed
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
if <unk> <unk> wanted to be accepted by the people of <unk> he should have taken an advisory role instead of one of forcing his personal preferences
furthermore his actions imply that it is too damaging or costly for society to provide jobs through power - plant construction coal mining or to build roads for public safety because of the adverse impact on the environment but it is just fine and dandy for him to transform a mountain high in the <unk> <unk> into a ski resort
it astounds me n he can rationalize his self - righteous and greedy actions in <unk>
an excellent environmental actor he is
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> like it or not is like a braking system on a runaway truck kind of slowing it down into control
he rich famous and intelligent and has the time n to do something that not even the federal government will do
<unk> <unk> is slowing down a mindless speeding maniac known as the progress of mankind
personally i glad n there are people like him around <unk> to slow down the profit takers and those who are in such a blind hurry for something that may appear to benefit them in the immediate future not caring about the long - range implications
<unk>
when <unk> <unk> travels to <unk> <unk> today he go with little of the fanfare that accompanies many of his foreign travels
but the two - day trip still has managed to fuel controversy over his administration policies in <unk> <unk>
some conservatives say <unk> <unk> <unk> should n't make the trip during which he will participate in <unk> <unk> celebration of n years of democracy
these critics object to <unk> <unk> participation in a meeting that includes nicaraguan <unk> <unk> <unk> among the guests
in addition they argue <unk> he wo n't help <unk> standing in the region by trumpeting the <unk> commitment to democracy less than a month after his administration played an ineffectual role in the failed coup attempt in <unk>
i believe <unk> it will do more damage than good because it will legitimize people like <unk> <unk> says <unk> <unk> who served as <unk> ambassador to <unk> <unk> during the <unk> administration
<unk> <unk> among other analysts connected to the conservative <unk> <unk> fears n the gathering of n leaders mostly from central american nations will force <unk> <unk> to explain and redeem himself in the wake of charges that the <unk> failed to do enough to aid the removal of panamanian dictator <unk> <unk>
at the same time liberal and moderate democrats note the irony of <unk> <unk> joining a celebration of costa rican democracy at a time <unk> his administration has sought sharp cuts in <unk> aid to the tiny country
the administration proposed only n million in so - called economic support funds for <unk> <unk> this year down from the <unk> million <unk> the <unk> provided last year
the administration said <unk> improvements in <unk> <unk> economic condition warrant the cut in aid which the country uses mainly to make payments on its n billion foreign debt
but costa rican officials argue that the recent drop in coffee prices combined with the country continuing struggle to reinvigorate its economy make the support as necessary as ever
we are crossing the river and we need a little more help to get to the other side said <unk> <unk> an economic affairs specialist at the costa rican <unk> in <unk>
<unk> argue that <unk> <unk> deserves more assistance for the same reason that <unk> <unk> is attending the celebration this weekend to reward the country for its stability in a region wracked with turmoil and for its efforts to promote peace in <unk>
however peace efforts by costa rican <unk> <unk> <unk> have n't always helped the country cause in <unk>
<unk> <unk> long - time refusal to support the <unk> campaign against leftist <unk> earned him the ire of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
and more recently he insisted on signing a five - nation agreement intended to disarm <unk> u.s.-backed contra rebels faster than the <unk> administration would prefer
i think n <unk> going there is a helpful sign said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a member of the <unk> relations <unk> who pushed to provide <unk> <unk> about the same amount of aid as it received last year
lawmakers in both houses support the higher level
administration officials defend <unk> <unk> decision to make the trip
while they acknowledge n the president will attend several meals and a working session also attended by <unk> <unk> they insist that <unk> <unk> wo n't be extending the nicaraguan leader any special courtesies
the administration also made clear its continuing distate for the leftist nicaraguan government in recent days endorsing a package of electoral aid to the nicaraguan opposition renewing the <unk> trade embargo against the country and continuing to complain that the country supports rebel groups in the region
officials also insist <unk> <unk> <unk> will use the trip to highlight his own initiatives for pushing democracy in the region fighting illegal drugs and assisting the less developed countries
let me say n there is a symbolic component to this trip <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> told reporters <unk>
there wo n't be any formal resolutions or communiques i do n't think n
but we still see this as an opportunity to discuss many many very important issues
in <unk> the presidents <unk> of the <unk> which oversees most <unk> intercollegiate sports contracted with the <unk> - based <unk> institutes for <unk> to do a survey on the college experiences of what the body chooses to call student - athletes
a brief executive summary was issued last <unk> and attracted some but not much attention
more - detailed reports followed and attracted even less notice
i suspect <unk> i may be one of the few people n to have read them all
the sixth and last report now is out and it puts the effort in perspective
titled comments from students it focuses on the real shame of college sports what happens to young athletes once they enter academe
it little less than a cry for help from those who make the costly show possible
the previous five reports were mainly statistical but clear enough in outline
they showed that participants in <unk> i football and men basketball the big - time revenue sports entered school with poorer high - school grades and test scores than minor - sport jocks and students who participated in other extracurricular activities and they got lower grades once they got there at least partly because of the athletic demands placed on them
the football and basketball players spent more time on their sports in season than they did on class attendance and homework combined n hours a week versus n
almost half n reported suffering mental abuse from coaches and almost one - quarter <unk> said n they had been pressured to ignore injuries
but even those numbers do n't describe the situation as well as the athletes do in their own words
the composite portrait that emerges is n't of a pampered jock marking time until he can land a seven - figure pro contract he part of a tiny minority
rather it of a kid we talking about <unk> to n year olds here having a tough time making the best of what will probably be his one shot at college
the pertinent question coming at the end of a lengthy confidential questionnaire was this are there things about your college life n you would like to tell us that we did n't ask about
of the almost n athletes surveyed <unk> took the time n to respond
here are a few of their answers they say that i am a student - athlete but really i an athlete - student
they lied to me on the recruiting trip
football is the no . n thing here
junior football player
being a student - athlete at college is a lot different from high school
first the sport n you play is no longer a game it becomes a job
your coaches demand a lot more out of you even though some of them are not willing to take the time n to watch you progress
you become expendable
your interest is not taken to heart because people only care about your performance
freshman basketball player
the coaches should have a more personal and sympathetic attitude toward the athletes not treat us like pieces of meat
they always say n to get a degree first but they do n't allow us time or to skip practice to study for a test
they just want to get their job done at any cost to the athlete
freshman football player
the pressure put on us to win at all times has resulted in physical violence such as punching and slapping by coaches
some days the coaches make you feel as though you are part of a large herd of animals
in other words they treat you like a piece of meat
sophomore football player
playing intercollegiate sports does n't give you a lot of time <unk> to spend with others
we are almost left out of campus social activities
this mostly happens because we go from football in the fall to lifting in the winter to football again in the spring
freshman football player
you talk about free time free time
<unk> <unk> to relax and enjoy ourselves is always taken up by something n to do with football meetings lifting weights conditioning or films
there is no recovery period it go go go
abuse to our bodies is overwhelming
with our schedule it hard to sleep well knowing what is going to happen the next day
junior football player
physical exhaustion and depression are common in my life and in some of my teammates lives
football player class unspecified
more often than not college athletes go through college never really experiencing collegiate life to the fullest
one has to establish one own identity away from athletics and make athletics only a part not a whole of the student - athlete life
sophomore basketball player
somehow and i do n't know how the game needs to be played for fun again and not for the big bowl revenues or lucrative tv contracts
graduate - student football player
there have been rumblings that at long last changes may be in the works
the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> has established a national commission <unk> to look into college - sports reform and the <unk> presidents <unk> earlier this month recommended cutting spring football practice in half moving the start of basketball practice back by a month and reducing maximum schedules in that sport to <unk> games from <unk>
the key word in that paragraph though is may
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in accepting a place on the <unk> <unk> urged that the panel take a balanced view which looks for all the world like a plea n not to rock the boat too much and the presidents recommendations could face considerable opposition at the <unk> full convention in <unk> which will vote on them
i read that one unnamed athletics director predicted that the basketball - cutback proposal could fail because of real world i.e. economic considerations
but the real world also includes the unpleasant truth that colleges are cheating the athletes n they have wooed and won
if they wo n't change their ways voluntarily maybe somebody bigger <unk> should make them
they want late - night shuttles to the biology labs
they want a <unk> library
and like college radicals everywhere they are talking about a demonstration where protesters would gather quietly near the science building and raise their hands classroom style
such is the fiber of the wool that woolly intellectuals let fly at gatherings of <unk> <unk> new <unk> of nerds and geeks or <unk>
songsters are mad as heck about campus anti - intellectualism and they are n't going to take it anymore at least not without trying a few really neat ideas first
we could have called ourselves the <unk> <unk> <unk> but then everyone would have said oh you mean the nerd - and-geek club <unk> <unk> <unk> graduate - student adviser told <unk> attendees at the club inaugural meeting earlier this month
membership has since swelled to between <unk> and <unk>
some people may think of nerds as calculator - toting socially awkward individuals with shirt - pocket liners for their pencils and a preoccupation with computers and matters numerical
geeks by at least one definition are chicken - mutilating circus freaks
but <unk> founder <unk> <unk> a <unk> junior thinks of nerds and geeks more as nonconformists albeit with a studious bent
one of the group first projects is a procrastination hot line that students could call when they have an urge to delay studying
the club plans to show nerdy movies such as real genius in which physics whizzes pop corn with lasers and naturally the revenge of the nerds a tale of college males with runny noses and ill - fitting pants
one of its more ambitious goals is to get <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> high - school mathematics teacher featured in the film <unk> and deliver to come to <unk> for a guest lecture
nerds and geeks sometimes find themselves a bit isolated at <unk>
so <unk> <unk> says <unk> high priority is being given to creating a computerized matchmaking service where instead of being matched for eye color you could be matched for similar intellectual interests
for instance
i a math major but i want to know about psychobiology
hopefully i find someone in psychobiology who wanted to know more about mathematics
it could work
meanwhile finding a volunteer n to write the computer program is n't a problem
<unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> was cleared by the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to acquire <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> the banks said n

<unk> <unk> <unk> directors authorized a <unk> split of the common payable <unk> n to stock of record <unk> n
the split was aimed at boosting the stock liquidity said <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman of the <unk> <unk> maker of plastic film products

environmental concerns are beginning to have as much influence in oil - industry spending plans as the price of crude does
in the wake of the <unk> <unk> spill in <unk> new governmental drilling bans are sharply curtailing exploration in promising locations offshore and in <unk>
at the same time moves toward tighter air - quality standards are spurring interest in lighter or alternative fuels that do n't pollute as much as fuel refined from heavy crudes generally high in sulfur
over the years the world stream of oil has been growing heavier
so the scramble is on for lighter crudes globally and for natural gas in the <unk>
recently <unk> <unk> and <unk> traditional heavy - crude producers have boasted of new finds of light low - sulfur oil by their national oil companies
<unk> has also earmarked n million in new money for light - crude exploration
and some oil companies are trying to lock in future supplies
typical is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> state - owned energy company which not long ago acquired through its <unk> oil subsidiary a <unk> share in the consortium accounting for half of <unk> oil output
<unk> already has an oil stake in <unk>
both countries produce high - quality low - sulfur crudes especially suited to making high - octane motor fuel at minimum refining cost
<unk> <unk> <unk> chairman looks for sweeping structural change in the oil industry he calls it a revolution requiring huge investments as a result of environmental issues
he made a special trip to examine <unk> environmental trends because they are often followed in <unk>
<unk> needs to know what coming as it prepares to spend some n billion on upgrading its refineries he says n
oil companies world - wide will have to spend a lot of money for the cleaner fuels that will be required says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the president of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
it will go for work ranging from refinery modification to changes in the distribution system including the way n service stations pump fuel into cars
in the <unk> the search for oil had been headed toward environmentally sensitive areas believed to have vast reserves
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> alone is thought to hide more than three billion barrels of oil
until the tanker spill <unk> <unk> was slowly convincing authorities n it could safely produce from such places
now the wildlife refuge has been closed to the industry possibly for years
similarly a group of companies led by <unk> <unk> has been unable to pump oil found off the <unk> coast in the early n
a huge production system built in the sea off <unk> <unk> and ashore is sitting idle
but the push for cleaner fuels is increasing the attractiveness of natural gas
more than half the domestic drilling now under way is for gas partly on the assumption that demand will rise for a fuel that is cleaner to burn than either oil or coal
activity has revived in the largest <unk> gas - producing regions such as the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which is owned by <unk> and is n't related to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> unit is stepping up development of a well off <unk> <unk> <unk> where it found gas in <unk>
we could have sat on it longer but the impetus is to get the gas to the marketplace says <unk> <unk> senior scout for <unk> <unk> <unk>
we trying to get it on line as soon as possible now
this month <unk> <unk> announced plans for a <unk> project drilling for gas about five miles underground in the <unk> <unk> of western <unk> the deepest drilling project in the <unk>
<unk> will use a <unk> <unk> <unk> rig built in <unk> that can go down n n miles
as the <unk> <unk> grapples with its worsening economy leading reformers have drawn up a blueprint for change designed to push the nation much closer to a free - market system
the proposals go far beyond the current and rather confused policies of perestroika <unk> <unk> restructuring of the economy
they lay out a clear timetable and methodology for liberalizing the system of setting prices breaking up huge industrial monopolies and putting unprofitable state - owned companies out of business
they also address such taboo subjects as the likelihood of unemployment and high inflation and recommend ways n to soften the social consequences
while many solutions to the nation economic troubles are being discussed the blueprint is attracting widespread attention here because of its comprehensiveness and presumed high - level authorship
although it was published unsigned in the latest edition of the weekly <unk> <unk> <unk> sources say n the article was written by <unk> <unk> and a small group of colleagues
<unk> <unk> head of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> of <unk> was recently appointed deputy chairman of the soviet government and head of a state commission on economic reform
it clearly a manifesto for the next stage of perestroika said one analyst
the economic ideas in the document are much bolder than current policies
for example the proposed overhaul of prices an extremely sensitive political topic is far more precise than the vague plans announced by <unk> <unk> in <unk> and later dropped
but the proposals also display political savvy couching some of the most controversial ideas in cautious language so as not to alienate powerful conservatives in the government who stand to lose out if they are implemented
seeking a middle path between opponents of change and radicals who demand overnight solutions the article advocates what it calls a radical - moderate approach
the document is to be discussed at a conference of leading economists late this month and will probably be presented to the soviet <unk> for consideration this year
as policy - makers draw up proposals for the next five - year plan which starts in <unk> the blueprint represents a powerful first shot in what is likely to be a fierce battle over economic reform
the authors make a gloomy assessment of the economy and concede that quick and easy paths to success simply do n't exist
instead they map out a strategy in several phases from now until n
most of the measures would probably only start to have an effect on beleaguered soviet consumers in two to three years at the earliest
the key steps advocated include <unk>
rigid ideological restrictions on property ownership should be abandoned
the document proposes breaking up the monolithic system of state - owned enterprises and farms and allowing a big private sector to flourish helped by tough anti - monopoly legislation
the economy would be thrown open to numerous types of ownership between now and <unk> including factories leased by workers or owned by shareholders cooperatives and joint ventures
some forms of private property would be sanctioned
such moves would greatly reduce the power of government ministries who now jealously guard their turf and are seen as one of the major obstacles blocking economic reform
finances
emergency measures would be introduced to ease the country financial crisis notably its n billion budget deficit
by the end of next year all loss - making state enterprises would be put out of business or handed over to workers who would buy or lease them or turn them into cooperatives
similar steps would be taken to liquidate unprofitable state and collective farms by the end of <unk>
a unified system of taxation should be introduced rapidly
to mop up some of the <unk> billion rubles in circulation the government should encourage home ownership including issuing bonds that guarantee holders the right to purchase an apartment
labor
a genuine market for labor and wages would replace the present rigid centralized system
departing from decades of soviet dogma the new system would lead to big differences in pay between workers and almost certainly to unemployment
to cushion the blows the government would introduce a minimum wage and unemployment benefits
prices
the entire system of centrally set prices would be overhauled and free - market prices introduced for most wholesale trade and some retail trade
consumers would still be able to buy some food and household goods at subsidized prices but luxury and imported items including food would be sold at market prices
wholesale prices would be divided into three categories raw materials sold at fixed prices close to world levels government - set procurement prices for a small number of key products and free prices for everything else to be determined by contracts between suppliers and purchasers
inflation - adjusted social benefits would ensure that the poor and elderly do n't suffer unduly
foreign trade
the current liberalization and decentralization of foreign trade would be taken much further
soviet companies would face fewer obstacles for exports and could even invest their hard currency abroad
foreigners would receive greater incentives to invest in the
alongside the current non - convertible ruble a second currency would be introduced that could be freely exchanged for dollars and other western currencies
a domestic foreign exchange market would be set up as part of an overhaul of the nation banking system
the blueprint is at its vaguest when referring to the fate of the two powerful economic institutions that seem likely to oppose such sweeping plans the <unk> <unk> <unk> known as <unk> and the <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> or <unk>
but it hints strongly that both organizations would increasingly lose their clout as the changes particularly the introduction of wholesale trade and the breakup of state monopolies take effect

but one recent day they became much closer
<unk> <unk> a rabid baseball fan pores over the sports pages to chart the exploits of my favorite and not - so-favorite teams and players
he often groans he says n at the clutter of sports stories about drugs alcohol gambling and some player lament about the miserly millions n he is offered to play the game
his morning paper the <unk> <unk> even carries a sports column called <unk> that recounts the latest arrests and convictions of players and team managers
like many sports buffs <unk> <unk> has turned cynic
but his is a story about a hero in an era of sports anti - heroes and about what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> reminds us n once called the only real game in the world
to <unk> <unk> it is also a story about love because i blessed to have a wife who still thinks n her slightly eccentric husband <unk> birthday deserves the ultimate present
to understand what <unk> <unk> means one must go back to a sunny <unk> afternoon in <unk> at <unk> <unk> <unk> grounds stadium where it can be argued the most dramatic moment in baseball history was played out
it was the ninth inning of the third game of a three - game playoff between the <unk> dodgers and the <unk> <unk> <unk> the predecessor to the <unk> <unk> giants scheduled to play in tonight world series
baseball fans throughout <unk> <unk> had sweated out a long summer with their teams and now it had come to this a battle between the two for the <unk> <unk> pennant down to the last inning of the last game no less

the <unk> got swamped in the second game <unk> and trailed <unk> going into the bottom of the ninth of the third and deciding game
the giants scored once and had runners on second <unk> <unk> and third <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> advanced to the plate
the rest as they say is history
<unk> <unk> a tall <unk> - born right - hand hitter stepped into the batter box
<unk> took a called strike <unk> <unk> recounts
the tension mounted as <unk> <unk> again on the mound stared down the batter
he wound up and let loose a fastball
the pitch sailed toward <unk> <unk> high and inside and then with a crack of the bat was sent rocketing back into the lower leftfield stands
giants fans went into euphoria says <unk> <unk>
and <unk> <unk> was made a legend
the same <unk> <unk> it turns out who sells those paper - goods today
there ca n't be an older baseball fan alive who does n't clearly remember that <unk> <unk> homer who ca n't tell you where he was when he heard the famous <unk> <unk> radio broadcast the one that concluded with <unk> <unk> shouting over and over the giants win the pennant the giants win the pennant
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> drifted in different directions in the subsequent years and the <unk> grounds located under <unk> <unk> in upper <unk> was replaced by a public - housing project
<unk> <unk> played outfield and third base until n posting a lifetime n batting average and chalking up n home runs before retiring and going into paper - goods sales
<unk> <unk> moved south to <unk> but he took with him enduring memories of the homer of <unk>
when his wife <unk> came down the aisle on their wedding day in <unk> <unk> <unk> no slouch on the romantic front gave her the ultimate compliment you look prettier than <unk> <unk> home run
the couple first dog <unk> was named after the <unk> event though unwitting friends assumed n he was the namesake of the poet
and when <unk> <unk> sister <unk> who was born two days before the home run reached her <unk> birthday <unk> <unk> wrote his sports hero to tell him of the coincidence of events
<unk> <unk> sent off a card to <unk> it does n't seem like n years since i hit that home run to celebrate your birth it read
<unk> was pleased but nowhere near as much as <unk> <unk>
the family license plate reads <unk> <unk> the first three letters of the family name and no surprise here <unk> <unk> uniform number
and on <unk> <unk> <unk> birthday his wife bought a book detailing the big homer and sent it off to <unk> <unk> to be autographed
what could have been better asks <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> asked the same question earlier this year when her husband was about to turn n
she had an idea
on her husband <unk> birthday after an auspicious n years of marriage it should be noted <unk> <unk> and their college - bound son set out for <unk> <unk> to visit <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> had scheduled a stop on the <unk> <unk> <unk> to she told her husband pick up some papers for a neighbor
the papers would be handed over at a bank of telephone booths just off exit n
it sounded like something out of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> recalls
at the appointed exit the family pulled over and <unk> <unk> went to get her papers
<unk> <unk> turned off the motor and rolled down the window
in a matter of minutes she was back with a tall silver - haired man in tow
she crouched down by the car window and addressed her husband with her favorite nickname
<unk> she said happy n <unk>
this is <unk> <unk>
and there he was recalls <unk> <unk>
the hero of my youth the one person in history n i most like to meet
keep your <unk> jeffersons or <unk> augustines or <unk> i take baseball <unk> <unk> without hesitation
they talked of the home run
i thought n it was in the upper deck said <unk> <unk> now n years old
they talked of the aftermath
i never thought n it would become so momentous <unk> remarked
<unk> <unk> says <unk> his wife was overwhelmed by the whole thing
it was worth it just for the look on <unk> face
the two men spent an hour at <unk> <unk> rehashing the event fulfilling the lifelong dream of a young boy now turned <unk> <unk> <unk> says
his hero signed photographs of the homer and diplomatically called <unk> <unk> a very fine pitcher
and when <unk> <unk> asked him why he took time off from work for somebody n he did n't even know <unk> <unk> replied you know <unk> <unk> if you have the chance in life to make somebody this happy you have an obligation to do it
in an interview <unk> <unk> who is married and has three grown children says <unk> he has few ties to baseball these days other than playing old - timers games now and again
but his fans to his constant amazement never let him forget the famous four - bagger
his mail regularly recalls my one event and has been growing in recent years
in response to the letters <unk> <unk> usually sends an autographed photo with a polite note and rarely arranges a rendezvous
but when <unk> <unk> wrote him saying <unk> she could stop near his <unk> <unk> home it seemed different
what a good feeling it would be for me to do that he says <unk> he thought
when the <unk> family got back from its trip up north <unk> <unk> wrote it all down just to make sure n no detail was missed
on the way home his notes recall it took concentrated effort to keep that car pointed south
my mind was miles north at a place called <unk> <unk> where a real sports hero had captured the imagination of a kid who never fully grew up and is all the richer for it
take heart sports fans he wrote
real heroes exist
you might not find one in the jurisprudence column
but who knows
you might meet up with him at that bank of telephone booths just off exit n of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> said <unk> its unprofitable weekly newspaper the <unk> <unk> of <unk> is up for sale
analysts said <unk> the announcement the latest in a series of divestitures and restructuring moves is aimed at improving <unk> earnings before the expiration in <unk> of a standstill pact with <unk> <unk>
when that agreement expires <unk> will be free to increase its <unk> stake in <unk> or to make an offer for the whole company
descendants of the <unk> family hold an additional <unk> stake in the <unk> - based company <unk> largest newspaper publisher
the newspaper could fetch between n million and n million canadian dollars <unk> n million to n million said n one analyst who asked not to be identified
a spokesman for <unk> declined to comment on the price n the company is seeking or on estimates of the paper annual losses which most analysts place at between <unk> n million and c$ n million
yesterday <unk> reported third - quarter earnings of c$ n million on revenue of <unk> n million down from <unk> n million on revenue of <unk> n million in the year - ago quarter
to be profitable the paper requires more circulation and building circulation is an expensive undertaking said <unk> <unk> the paper publisher
<unk> said <unk> the level of future investment required by the paper would have restricted its options in other areas
the acquisition of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> is well within reach for any number of media companies both public and private said <unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> - based <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
possible bidders include <unk> <unk> a <unk> financier and vice chairman of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a holding company controlled by <unk> <unk> family
<unk> <unk> sold his stake in <unk> <unk> to <unk> earlier this year and is said to be seeking a media acquisition
<unk> <unk> could n't be reached for comment but <unk> <unk> - <unk> chairman of <unk> <unk> a closely held concern that publishes two business magazines said <unk> his company would take a close look at the newspaper
<unk> <unk> said <unk> the sale of the <unk> <unk> <unk> which <unk> has owned since <unk> is consistent with <unk> strategy of cutting costs to obtain maximum profits from its operations while disposing of chronically under - performing assets
<unk> agreed to sell its <unk> stake in <unk> communications <unk> a broadcasting concern to <unk> <unk> <unk> for about c$ n million last year
this year it has moved to cut costs in its newspaper division through layoffs and asset sales while reaching joint venture and acquisition agreements in other areas
the <unk> <unk> of <unk> has no links to the british daily newspaper the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> said <unk> net income for the third quarter fell <unk> to n million or n cents a share from n million or <unk> a share
operating profit for the abrasives engineering materials and petroleum services concern was n million or n cents a share up n from n million or n cents a share
the company had a tax credit of n million
in the year - earlier quarter the tax credit was n million
sales rose <unk> to n million from n million
operating profit in the company abrasives segment rose n while operating profit in the engineering materials segment rose n
however the company petroleum services segment while profitable was hurt by high financing costs associated with the company buy - out of a <unk> stake in <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk> last <unk>
<unk> and <unk> <unk> had each held a <unk> stake in <unk> in a joint venture
<unk> announced earlier this month that it was exploring the possible sale of all or part of <unk> <unk>
for the nine months <unk> had net of n million or <unk> a share and a tax credit of n million
in the year - earlier period the company had net of n million or <unk> a share and a tax credit of n million
<unk> had operating profit of n million or <unk> a share up n from n million or <unk> a share
sales rose <unk> to n billion from n billion
<unk> <unk> and her family scrimped for four years to buy a tiny apartment here but found that the closer they got to saving the <unk> <unk> they originally needed the more the price rose
by this month it had more than doubled
now the <unk> housewife whose husband earns a modest salary as an assistant professor of economics is saving harder than ever
i am determined to get an apartment in three years she says
it all n i think about or talk about
for the parks and millions of other young koreans the long - cherished dream of home ownership has become a cruel illusion
for the government it has become a highly volatile political issue
last <unk> a government panel released a report on the extent and causes of the problem
during the past <unk> years the report showed <unk> housing prices increased nearly fivefold
the report laid the blame on speculators who it said <unk> had pushed land prices up ninefold
the panel found that since <unk> real - estate prices rose nearly n in a speculative fever fueled by economic prosperity the <unk> <unk> olympics and the government pledge to rapidly develop <unk> southwest
the result is that those rich enough to own any real estate at all have boosted their holdings substantially
for those with no holdings the prospects of buying a home are ever slimmer
in <unk> a quarter of the population owned n of the nation n square kilometers of private land the report said <unk> and <unk> of the population owned n of the land devoted to housing
meanwhile the government <unk> <unk> reports that only about a third of korean families own their own homes
rents have soared along with house prices
former <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> - <unk> now a radio commentator says <unk> the problem is intolerable for many people
i afraid of a popular revolt if this situation is n't corrected he adds
in fact during the past three months there have been several demonstrations at the office complex where the <unk> <unk> is housed and at the <unk> <unk> demanding <unk> the government put a stop to real - estate speculation
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> administration has been studying the real - estate crisis for the past year with an eye to partial land redistribution
last week the government took three bills to the <unk> <unk>
the proposed legislation is aimed at rectifying some of the inequities in the current land - ownership system
highlights of the bills as currently framed are a restriction on the amount of real estate <unk> one family can own to <unk> square meters in the nation six largest cities but more in smaller cities and rural areas
the government will penalize offenders but wo n't confiscate property
a tax of between <unk> and <unk> on property holdings that exceed the governmentset ceiling
taxes of between <unk> and <unk> a year on excessive profits from the resale of property or the sale of idle land to the government
the government defines excessive profits as those above the average realized for other similar - sized properties in an area
grace periods ranging from two to five years before the full scope of the penalties takes effect
the administration says n the measures would stem rampant property speculation free more land for the government ambitious housing - construction program designed to build two million apartments by <unk> and perhaps boost the popular standing of <unk> <unk>
but opposition legislators and others calling for help for <unk> <unk> renters say n the proposed changes do n't go far enough to make it possible for ordinary people to buy a home
some want lower limits on house sizes others insist on progressively higher taxation for larger homes and lots
the citizens <unk> for <unk> <unk> a public - interest group leading the charge for radical reform wants restrictions on landholdings high taxation of capital gains and drastic revamping of the value - assessment system on which property taxes are based
but others large landowners real - estate developers and business leaders say n the government proposals are intolerable
led by the <unk> of <unk> industries the critics are lobbying for the government to weaken its proposed restrictions and penalties
government officials who are urging real - estate reforms balk at the arguments of business leaders and chafe at their pressure
there is no violation of the capitalistic principle of private property in what we are doing says <unk> <unk> <unk> director of the government <unk> <unk> which drafted the bills
but he adds n the constitution empowers the government to impose some controls to mitigate the shortage of land
the land available for housing construction stands at about <unk> square meters a person n lower than in <unk> and only about half that of <unk>
<unk> <unk> estimates that about <unk> property speculators are operating in <unk> <unk>
the chief culprits he says n are big companies and business groups that buy huge amounts of land not for their corporate use but for resale at huge profit
one research institute calculated that as much as <unk> of corporate - owned land is held by <unk> companies and that as little as n of that is used for business
the government <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> told the <unk> <unk> this month that in the first half of n the nation n largest business groups bought real estate valued at n billion
the <unk> of <unk> as a result has proposed a series of measures that would restrict business investment in real estate even more tightly than restrictions aimed at individuals
under those measures financial institutions would be restricted from owning any more real estate than they need for their business operations
banks investment and credit firms would be permitted to own land equivalent in value to n of their capital currently the proportion is <unk>
the maximum allowable property holdings for insurance companies would be reduced to <unk> of their total asset value down from <unk> currently
but <unk> <unk> acknowledges that even if the policies work to slow or stop speculation apartment prices are unlikely to go down
at best she realizes n they will rise more slowly more slowly she hopes n than her family income
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> declared its initial quarterly of five cents a share payable <unk> n to stock of record <unk> n
the maker of specialty chemicals has about n million shares outstanding
the company said n the move recognizes its strong financial position
although profits were squeezed in <unk> mainly as a result of higher raw - material costs the company said <unk> it is confident about future earnings and cash flow for n and beyond
in national over - the-counter trading yesterday <unk> shares rose n cents to close at <unk> a share
the <unk> <unk> said <unk> it is seeking to join a private lawsuit challenging a <unk> suburb zoning ordinance that sharply restricts the locations available to group homes for the handicapped
this would be the department first suit challenging a local zoning ordinance under <unk> amendments to the <unk> <unk> <unk>
under those amendments which took effect in <unk> of this year the federal government can intervene in private housing - discrimination lawsuits
the ordinance in <unk> <unk> prohibits locating a group home for the handicapped within a mile of another such facility
in papers filed with the federal district court in <unk> the <unk> <unk> alleged that the ordinance by limiting the number of group homes that can be established in the township makes housing unavailable on account of handicap
the private suit was brought by three mentally retarded people who live in a group home in <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> manager said <unk> the ordinance is intended to prevent the concentration of group homes for the mentally retarded from changing the character and flavor of the neighborhood
he said n the ordinance also will benefit the mentally retarded
our intent is to spread them out to insure n they are well integrated into the community he said n
energetic and concrete action has been taken in <unk> during the past <unk> days against the mafiosi of the drug trade but it has not been sufficiently effective because unfortunately it came too late
ten years ago the newspaper <unk> <unk> of which my brother <unk> was editor began warning of the rise of the drug mafias and of their leaders aspirations to control colombian politics especially the <unk>
then when it would have been easier to resist them nothing was done and my brother was murdered by the drug mafias three years ago
the most ruthless dictatorships have not censored their press more brutally than the drug mafias censor <unk>
the censorship is enforced through terrorism and assassination
in the past n years about n journalists have been silenced forever murdered
within the past two months a bomb exploded in the offices of the <unk> <unk> in <unk> destroying a major part of its installations and equipment
and only last week the newspaper <unk> <unk> in the city of <unk> was bombed and its installations destroyed
journalists and their families are constantly threatened as are the newspaper distribution outlets
distribution centers are bombed and advertisers are intimidated
censorship is imposed by terrorism
if the colombian media accept this new and hideous censorship there is little doubt that the drug mafia terrorism someday will extend to all the newspapers published in the free world
the solidarity of the uncensored media world - wide against drug terrorism is the only way n press freedom can survive
the american people and their government also woke up too late to the menace n drugs posed to the moral structure of their country
even now the american attack upon this tremendous problem is timid in relation to the magnitude of the threat
i can attest that a recent colombian visitor to the <unk> was offered drugs three times in the few blocks walk between <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> in midtown <unk>
<unk> alone its government its people its newspapers does not have the capacity <unk> to fight this battle successfully
all drug - consuming countries must jointly decide to combat and punish the consumers and distributors of drugs
the <unk> as the major drug consumer should lead this joint effort
reduction if not the total cessation of drug consumption is the requirement for victory
much is being done in <unk> <unk> to fight the drug cartel mafia
luxurious homes and ranches have been raided by the military authorities and sophisticated and powerful communications equipment have been seized
more than n planes and helicopters have been impounded at airports and a large number of vehicles and launches has been confiscated
the military has also captured enormous arsenals of powerful and sophisticated weapons explosives and other war - like materiel
much has been accomplished and public opinion decisively supports the government and the army but on the other hand none of the key drug barons have been captured
there has been a lot of talk that a large portion of the colombian economy is sustained by the laundering of drug money
in my opinion this is not true
laundered drug money has served only to increase unrealistically the price of real estate creating serious problems for low - income people who aspire to own their own homes
drug money has also gone to buy expensive cars airplanes launches and nightclubs where drugs are consumed
but most of the drug money is kept in investments and in financial institutions outside <unk>
in fact the cooperation of those financial institutions is essential to the success of the drug battle
what is of much more importance to the colombian economy than the supposed benefits of laundered drug money is higher prices for <unk> legitimate products
the price of coffee has gone down almost n since the beginning of the year to the lowest level after inflation since the <unk> <unk>
market conditions point to even lower prices next year
the <unk> coffee cartel had to be formally dissolved this summer
as a result <unk> will earn n million less from its coffee this year than last
our coffee growers face reductions in their income and this tempts them to contemplate substituting coca crops for coffee
<unk> interests occasionally try to impose barriers to the import of another important colombian export cut flowers into the american market
a just price and an open market for what colombian produces and exports should be the policy of the <unk>
i take advantage of this opportunity given to me by the <unk> <unk> <unk> to make a plea to the millions of readers of this newspaper to become soldiers dedicated to the fight against the use of drugs
each gram of cocaine consumed is a deadly bullet against those in our country and in the rest of the world who fight this terrible scourge
a crusade of no to the consumption of drugs is imperative
<unk> <unk> is president of <unk> <unk> a newspaper founded by his grandfather
it has more drug users than <unk> has people
thirty - four thousand of its children live in foster homes while n residents have no homes at all
its tax base is shrinking a n billion budget deficit looms and the city faces contract negotiations with all major municipal unions next year
this is <unk> <unk> <unk>
when the dust and dirt settle in an extra - nasty mayoral race the man most likely to gain custody of all this is a career politician named <unk> <unk>
running the nation largest and most ornery city may be no treat but at least <unk> <unk> knows what to expect from it
as the campaign hits the home stretch however voters still have very little idea what they can expect from him
after n years in city politics <unk> <unk> remains an enigma
the soft - spoken silver - haired <unk> borough president the first black man n to win the democratic nomination for mayor here does n't have a single prominent political enemy
while he is widely described as a man with deep convictions he has few major political programs that he can call his own
asked about his greatest achievement in public life he first speaks about the quality of his staff
now as election day nears even some supporters wonder what he will do if he wins the mayoralty on <unk> n
they wonder whether he can be firm with his longtime allies including union leaders and political cronies who may seek a place at the trough
they wonder whether he has the economic know - how <unk> to steer the city through a possible fiscal crisis and they wonder who will be advising him
will he if he wins be in the thrall of the most liberal of his allies who advocate such policies as rent control for commercial buildings or will he tilt toward the real - estate interests that have funneled money into his campaign
after his decisive primary victory over <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> coasted until recently on a quite - comfortable lead over his republican opponent <unk> <unk> the former crime buster who has proved a something of a bust as a candidate
but <unk> <unk> has stumbled in the past two weeks over his campaign payments to a black activist who is a convicted kidnapper and over his handling of a stock sale to his son
polls also have recorded some slippage in <unk> <unk> support among jewish voters and citywide projections now put his lead at between four and n percentage points
in an interview with reporters and editors of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> appears quite confident of victory and of his ability to handle the mayoralty
a lot of people think n i will give away the store but i can assure you n i will not he says
i am aware n we have real budgetary problems
the city is full of aging bridges water mains and roadways that are in need of billions of dollars worth of repair
renewed efforts to fight drugs and crime will be costly
but city officials say n tax revenues are lagging
and after a decade of explosive job growth on <unk> <unk> a period of contraction is under way
<unk> <unk> already has announced <unk> he will drop n jobs from the city payroll but that wo n't be enough
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> predicts a n billion budget gap for the city next fiscal year a gap that could grow if there is a recession
if elected <unk> <unk> will probably have no choice but to raise taxes on overburdened businesses or cut spending in already under - serviced neighborhoods
he is going to face a mess says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
his supporters are not venal but their solution to everything will be to spend more money and he wo n't have any money
by and large <unk> <unk> has finessed the touchy question of whose ox he would gore
instead of focusing on the financial future <unk> <unk> has sold himself as a unifier for a city recently touched by racial violence and as a soothing antidote to n years of commotion generated by <unk> <unk>
the thing about the <unk> candidacy is that it offers hope to a broad range of people says <unk> <unk> a real - estate executive and former aide to <unk> <unk> <unk>
it is a feel - good candidacy
no doubt <unk> <unk> has been a calming influence
he is an avuncular figure who remembers the birthdays of colleagues children opens doors for women and almost never has a bad word n to say about anybody
more important he emerged as a peacemaker last summer after the <unk> <unk> rape of a white jogger in which a group of <unk> teens was charged and the racial murder of a black teen - ager in the white <unk> neighborhood of <unk>
rather than scaring off white voters as many predicted n he would <unk> <unk> attracted many whites precisely because of his reputation for having a cool head
keeping cool is a <unk> priority on humid days this summer he was known to change his double - breasted suits as many as four times a day
but even in his front - runner campaign he has shown signs of the indecisiveness and confusion that some say <unk> has plagued his tenure as <unk> borough president and might hinder him as mayor
over the last few weeks he has frittered away roughly half of what was once a <unk> lead in the polls over <unk> <unk>
a story about how he mishandled the sale to his son of his stock in a media company controlled by his political patron <unk> <unk> was allowed to fester a full week before <unk> <unk> faced the media
he has canceled numerous campaign appointments and was largely inaccessible to the media until the stock story broke
his campaign was caught flat - footed amid allegations n it paid almost n for what it said <unk> was a get - out-the-vote effort by black activist <unk> <unk> a convicted kidnapper who later said publicly that he is anti - white
critics have said n the payment looked like an attempt by the <unk> camp to get <unk> <unk> to stop leading confrontational demonstrations protesting the <unk> murder protests n the campaign may have feared n could cause some white voters to turn from a black candidate
<unk> <unk> also has failed to allay jewish voters fears about his association with the <unk> <unk> <unk> despite the fact that few local non - jewish politicians have been as vocal for jewish causes in the past <unk> years as <unk> <unk> has
these campaign problems have echoed difficulties <unk> <unk> <unk> has run into before
a former <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> got off to a quick start in politics joining a local democratic political club in the n linking up with black urban leaders such as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and getting himself elected to the state assembly in <unk>
but his chance to become deputy mayor under <unk> <unk> <unk> a plan boosted by <unk> <unk> was squandered because of <unk> <unk> failure still largely unexplained to file income tax returns for four years running
i always thought of this as a thing that could always be done tomorrow he said at the time
later <unk> <unk> became more deeply indebted to <unk> <unk> and other city pols including then - <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when they helped him get appointed city clerk a largely ceremonial post responsible for the city marriage bureau among other things
<unk> <unk> is now one of the lawyers for <unk> <unk> media company
the debt rose further in <unk> when <unk> <unk> resigned his position as <unk> borough president to run for mayor
<unk> <unk> recalls when i left i sat down with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> said who will run for borough president and i said you will
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> longtime media adviser says of <unk> <unk> he really is the personification of the patronage system
but the guy is so personally decent n people tend to forget that
<unk> <unk> lost twice by wide margins before finally getting elected borough president in <unk>
but by most accounts he made little of the post and was best known among city politicians for his problems making up his mind on matters before the city <unk> of <unk> the body that votes on crucial budget and land - use matters
colleagues today recall with some humor how meetings would crawl into the early morning hours as <unk> <unk> would march his staff out of board meetings and into his private office to discuss en masse certain controversial proposals
he taught me how to drink herbal tea instead of coffee at <unk> a.m. i give him that says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
often <unk> <unk> procrastination prevented him from having a say in the way n things turned out critics claim n
on the campaign stump he often points out that he was the only <unk> of <unk> member <unk> to vote against a controversial real - estate project at <unk> <unk> <unk>
but board members say n he took so long to decide how to vote that by the time n he decided it was too late to try to draw other members to his position
says one city official everybody else had brought in the wagons and made their deal
he would have got a lot more done if he made up his mind faster
one <unk> member <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was said to be so impatient with <unk> <unk> behavior at many meetings that he withheld his support for <unk> <unk> mayoral effort until late in the primary campaign
i had some problem from time to time on the length of time n he would take to make up his mind <unk> <unk> admits but he maintains that he did n't delay his support of <unk> <unk> and that he backs the democratic candidate enthusiastically
<unk> <unk> campaign manager and former chief of staff <unk> <unk> denies that the <unk> borough president has taken too long to decide important issues
we did n't rubber - stamp everything that came to us <unk> <unk> says
on some occasions when <unk> <unk> has discussed the issues during the campaign he has run into a familiar kind of trouble
some supporters were stunned this summer when <unk> <unk> suggested weakening the law forbidding public employees to go on strike
he withdrew the remark
when he later sided with striking hospital workers some allies cringed a little more concerned that <unk> <unk> was setting the wrong tone for coming contract negotiations with city employees
then two days before receiving an endorsement from environmental groups <unk> <unk> promised n he would issue a three - year moratorium on construction of garbage - incinerator plants
that announcement was roundly criticized by <unk> <unk> who has endorsed <unk> <unk> because the city faces a garbage crisis and has already spent n million planning for an incinerator that would be scrapped under <unk> <unk> proposal
while his public statements have at times been confusing <unk> <unk> position papers have more consistently reflected anti - development sentiment
he favors a form of commercial rent control which the financial community believes n would make it more difficult to attract investment in the city
in the midst of a labor shortage he proposes linking city subsidies to businesses to their record of hiring <unk> <unk> <unk> residents
with an untrained local labor pool many experts believe <unk> that policy could drive businesses from the city
and he favors a more cooperative approach toward the neighboring states of <unk> <unk> and <unk> in the battle over companies thinking of moving employees out of <unk> <unk> <unk>
many economic - development officials say n the <unk> administration aggressive approach helped save <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> jobs from moving across the <unk>
but <unk> <unk> economic planks do n't seem to bother the business community where he draws significant support
<unk> <unk> president of the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> an industry organization says <unk> <unk> <unk> economic development program is shortsighted but when it comes down to it he can be reasonable
<unk> <unk> inner circle of advisers appears to include both ideologues and pragmatists leaving voters with little clue as to who will be more influential
the key man seems to be the campaign manager <unk> <unk>
a disheveled roly - poly son of a <unk> <unk> potato farmer <unk> <unk> is a veteran union organizer who worked on the presidential campaigns of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
but as the <unk> campaign hit tough times this month <unk> <unk> the politically seasoned son of the <unk> <unk> governor is also said to have taken a more active role on strategy
another close ally is <unk> <unk> a <unk> city councilwoman some of whose programs such as commercial rent control have made their way into <unk> <unk> position papers
if she remains influential with <unk> <unk> as some suggest n she will his mayoralty may take on a more anti - development flavor
but <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who would head a <unk> transition team is more mainstream as is real - estate executive <unk> <unk> another insider
<unk> <unk> also has said n he would receive economic advice from a board that would include <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> investment banker <unk> <unk> leveraged - buy-out specialist <unk> <unk> and attorney <unk> <unk>
some business leaders and others also believe that <unk> <unk> would place significant responsibility in the hands of a deputy mayor with a strong administrative background
names of possible deputies that have surfaced include former mayoral candidate <unk> <unk> former schools chancellor <unk> <unk> and messrs. <unk> and <unk>
then there are <unk> <unk> old - time <unk> colleagues such as <unk> <unk> <unk> former <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
having attained positions of real influence or wealth these men constitute the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> black politics they are less confrontational than the younger more activist black political community that has been based largely in <unk>
part of <unk> <unk> strength is his ability to win the support of both the <unk> and <unk> factions
we know n there are potholes for the city out there says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> former law partner
if any of us think n we going to sidetrack <unk> determination n to be the best possible mayor because of his obligations to us we are making a sad mistake
adds <unk> <unk> who is expected to win the borough president job <unk> <unk> <unk> is vacating you have to remember <unk> <unk> is a pragmatist
but <unk> <unk> sense of pragmatism often comes across more as an insider determination not to upset the political apple cart
he is taken aback in an interview when asked whether as mayor he plans on reforming the political fiefdoms that perpetuate the monumental ineffectiveness of <unk> <unk> school system
i will sit down and talk some of the problems out but take on the political system uh - uh he says with a shake of the head
despite many doubts about his candidacy white new yorkers who gave <unk> <unk> <unk> of their votes in the primary are n't expected to desert in sufficient numbers to turn the election to <unk> <unk>
the former <unk> attorney who prosecuted targets ranging from <unk> dons to <unk> <unk> executives has succeeded in raising questions about <unk> <unk> ethical standards but so far has failed to generate excitement about his own candidacy
as a <unk> in an overwhelmingly democratic city <unk> <unk> has an inherent handicap
as a first - time candidate he has been slow to learn the nuances of <unk> <unk> <unk> politicking
<unk> <unk> is finding that <unk> <unk> in his many years in public life has built up considerable good will that so far has led many voters to overlook certain failings
the bottom line is that he is a very genuine and decent guy says <unk> <unk> a jewish community leader
in the end i think <unk> <unk> will be judged for being <unk>
<unk> <unk> pulls a tape measure across the front of what was once a stately victorian home
a deep trench now runs along its north wall exposed when the house lurched two feet off its foundation during last week earthquake
a side porch was ripped away
the chimney is a pile of bricks on the front lawn
the remainder of the house leans precariously against a sturdy oak tree
the petite <unk> <unk> <unk> dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt as she slogs through the steady afternoon rain is a claims adjuster with <unk> <unk> <unk>
she has been on the move almost incessantly since last <unk> when an army of adjusters employed by major insurers invaded the <unk> <unk> area to help policyholders sift through the rubble and restore some order to their lives
equipped with cellular telephones laptop computers calculators and a pack of blank checks they parcel out money so their clients can find temporary living quarters buy food replace lost clothing repair broken water heaters and replaster walls
some of the funds will used to demolish unstable buildings and clear sites for future construction
many adjusters are authorized to write checks for amounts up to <unk> on the spot
they do n't flinch at writing them
that my job get policyholders what they entitled to says <unk> <unk> a claims supervisor who flew in from <unk> <unk> <unk> office
the victorian house that <unk> <unk> is inspecting has been deemed unsafe by town officials
but she asks a workman toting the bricks from the lawn to give her a boost through an open first - floor window
once inside she spends nearly four hours measuring and diagramming each room in the <unk> house gathering enough information to estimate what it would cost to rebuild it
she snaps photos of the buckled floors and the plaster that has fallen away from the walls
while she works inside a tenant returns with several friends to collect furniture and clothing
one of the friends sweeps broken dishes and shattered glass from a countertop and starts to pack what can be salvaged from the kitchen
others grab books records photo albums sofas and chairs working frantically in the fear that an aftershock will jolt the house again
the owners <unk> and <unk> <unk> are luckier than many others
a few years ago <unk> <unk> insisted on buying earthquake insurance for this house which had been converted into apartments
only about <unk> of <unk> home and business owners carried earthquake coverage
the hammacks own home also in <unk> <unk> suffered comparatively minor damage
<unk> <unk> who works out of <unk> office in <unk> <unk> an <unk> <unk> suburb is awed by the earthquake destructive force
it really brings you down to a human level she says
it hard to accept all the suffering n people are going through but you have to
if you do n't you ca n't do your job
for <unk> and other insurers the <unk> <unk> earthquake hit when resources in the field already were stretched
most companies still are trying to sort through the wreckage caused by <unk> <unk> in the carolinas last month
<unk> which has nearly n adjusters had deployed about n of them in <unk> <unk> and <unk>
adjusters who had been working on the <unk> <unk> say n the insurer will still be processing claims from that storm through <unk>
it could take six to nine months to handle the earthquake - related claims
when the earthquake rocked northern <unk> last week <unk> senior claims executives from the <unk> <unk> area were at the company <unk> <unk> headquarters for additional training on how to handle major catastrophes including earthquakes
since commercial airline flights were disrupted the company chartered three planes to fly these executives back to the <unk> <unk> and bring along portable computers cellular phones and some claims adjusters
because of the difficulty of assessing the damages caused by the earthquake <unk> pulled together a team of its most experienced claims adjusters from around the country
even so few had ever dealt with an earthquake
some adjusters like <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> had been working in <unk> for nearly four weeks
he returned home last <unk> packed a bag with fresh clothes and reported for duty <unk> in <unk> <unk>
offices were set up in <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
in a few instances <unk> knew <unk> it would probably be shelling out big bucks even before a client called or faxed in a claim
for example officials at <unk> <unk> office learned that the <unk> <unk> near the <unk> <unk> airport which is insured by <unk> was badly damaged when they saw it on network television news
the secret to being a good adjuster is counting says <unk> <unk> an <unk> adjuster from <unk> <unk>
you have to count everything
adjusters must count the number of bathrooms balconies fireplaces chimneys microwaves and dishwashers
but they must also assign a price to each of these items as well as to floors wallcoverings roofing and siding to come up with a total value for a house
to do that they must think in terms of sheetrock by the square foot carpeting by the square yard wallpaper by the roll molding by the linear foot
using a calculator and a unit - price guide for such jobs as painting plumbing and roofing in each major region of the country adjusters can figure out the value of a home in today market and what it would cost to rebuild it
sometimes repairs are out of the question
when <unk> adjuster <unk> <unk> visited a retired couple in <unk> last <unk> he found them living in a mobile home parked in front of their yard
the house itself located about n yards from the collapsed section of double - decker highway <unk> <unk> was pushed about four feet off its foundation and then collapsed into its basement
the next day <unk> <unk> presented the couple with a check for <unk> to help them build a new home in the same neighborhood
he also is working with a real - estate agent to help find them an apartment n to rent while their home is being built
many of the adjusters employed by <unk> and other insurers have some experience with construction work or carpentry
but such skills were alien to <unk> <unk>
four years ago she was managing a film - processing shop and was totally bored
a friend mentioned that she might want to look into a position at <unk> if she was interested in a job that would constantly challenge her
she signed up starting as an inside adjuster who settles minor claims and does a lot of work by phone
a year later she moved to the commercial property claims division
she spent a month at an <unk> school in <unk> <unk> learning all about the construction trade including masonry plumbing and electrical wiring
that was followed by three months at the <unk> <unk> in <unk> where she was immersed in learning how to read and interpret policies
her new line of work has some perils
recently a contractor saved her from falling three stories as she investigated what remained of an old victorian house torched by an arsonist
i owe that contractor
i really do she says
as <unk> <unk> stands outside the <unk> house after winding up her chores there the house begins to creak and sway
the ground shakes underneath her
it is an aftershock one of about <unk> since the earthquake and it makes her uneasy
the next day as she prepares a n check for the <unk> which will cover the cost of demolishing the house and clearing away the debris she jumps at the slightest noise
on further reflection she admits that venturing inside the <unk> <unk> the previous day was n't such a great idea
during her second meeting with the <unk> <unk> <unk> reviews exactly what their policy covers
they would like to retrieve some appliances on the second floor but wonder if it safe to venture inside
<unk> <unk> tells them that if the appliances ca n't be salvaged their policy covers the replacement cost
<unk> <unk> is eager to know what <unk> will pay for the house which has to come down
when will i get that check for a million dollars he jokes
the adjuster had n't completed all the calculations but says we talking policy limits
in this case that about <unk>
it suddenly dawns on <unk> <unk> that rebuilding the house in <unk> <unk> an affluent community in <unk> <unk> <unk> may cost more than <unk> policy will pay
we can lose money on this he says
and you did n't want me to buy earthquake insurance says <unk> <unk> reaching across the table and gently tapping his hand
earthquake insurance costs about <unk> to <unk> annually for every n of value and high deductibles mean <unk> it generally pays only when there is a catastrophe
so many californians believe n they can get by without it
even <unk> <unk> herself made that assumption
i always knew that the <unk> <unk> was coming but not during my lifetime she says
now she says n she thinking of contacting her own insurance agent
for <unk> <unk> dealing with the earthquake has been more than just a work experience
she lives in <unk> a community hit hard by the earthquake
she did n't have hot water for five days
the apartment n she shares with a <unk> daughter and her sister was rattled books and crystal hit the floor but nothing was severely damaged
her sister <unk> wishes <unk> <unk> had a different job
we worry about her out there <unk> says
last <unk> <unk> <unk> finally got a chance to water her plants but stopped abruptly
i realized <unk> i could n't waste this water when there are people in <unk> who do n't have fresh water n to drink
she has n't played any music since the earthquake hit out of respect for those who died on <unk> <unk> where the roadway collapsed
the <unk> communications <unk> allowed <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to continue offering discount phone services for large - business customers and said n it would soon re - examine its regulation of the long - distance market
the <unk> moves were good news for <unk> which has been striving since the breakup of the phone system for greater latitude in pricing and reduced regulation
<unk> <unk> the new <unk> chairman championed deregulation of <unk> at his last job as head of a <unk> <unk> telecommunications agency
but it has been an open question whether <unk> <unk> an extraordinarily cautious man would continue pushing deregulation at the <unk> in the face of what is likely to be great political pressure
it means that <unk> is serious about the deregulation of long distance said <unk> <unk> a telecommunications analyst at <unk> <unk> who attended the <unk> meeting
all the commissioners were in amazing agreement to re - examine regulation for only having been together for a few months
the <unk> took three specific actions regarding <unk>
by a <unk> vote it allowed <unk> to continue offering special discount packages to big customers called <unk> <unk> rejecting appeals by <unk> competitors that the discounts were illegal
then by a separate n vote it chose the narrowest possible grounds n to strike down a different discount plan called tariff <unk> that <unk> offered to <unk> <unk>
<unk> gave a n to n discount to the <unk> <unk> company that oversees <unk> inns in response to a similar discount offered to <unk> <unk> by <unk> communications <unk>
the agency said that because <unk> offer had expired <unk> could n't continue to offer its discount plan
but the agency specifically did n't rule whether <unk> had the right to match offers by competitors if that means giving discounts not generally available to other phone users
indeed <unk> <unk> <unk> vice president for business - communications services said <unk> <unk> offered a similar <unk> <unk> discount to <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> to meet another <unk> bid
the <unk> did n't say <unk> i could n't do it again he said
apart from those two actions <unk> <unk> and the three other commissioners said <unk> they expect to re - examine how <unk> is regulated since competition has increased
<unk> <unk> chief of the <unk> common - carrier bureau said n he expected the agency to propose new rules next year
<unk> applauded the <unk> actions
the time is long overdue n to take a look at the fierce competition in the long - distance business and the rules governing it the <unk> <unk> telecommunications firm said in a statement
but <unk> of <unk> was displeased with the <unk> decision concerning tariff n arguing that <unk> can not be allowed to flaunt <unk> rules
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> unit said <unk> it was obviously disappointed with the <unk> decision on tariff n
<unk> <unk> said was <unk> it will petition the <unk> decision in federal court
we believe that the court will find it unlawful said a <unk> <unk> spokesman
separately <unk> filed a countersuit against <unk> accusing it of misleading consumers through allegedly false and deceptive advertising
the <unk> action was the most recent blow in a nasty fight
earlier this month <unk> sued <unk> in federal district court claiming that <unk> ads are false
<unk> assembled three of its top executives in <unk> all visibly angry to try to refute <unk> charges
<unk> has made hawks out of the upper echelon of <unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> who said n he expected <unk> to become increasingly aggressive in dealing with its longtime nemesis

billions of investors dollars are pouring out of the nation junk - bond mutual funds undermining a pillar of support in the already reeling junk market
last week alone an eye - popping n billion flowed out of the junk funds or nearly n of their total assets according to estimates by <unk> <unk> services <unk> a <unk> research firm
in the past two months the nation n junk funds have lost a total of about <unk> billion more than <unk> of assets through sales or transfers of junk - fund shares <unk> says <unk>
it made the estimates based on data collected from more than a dozen big junk funds
interviews with three major fund groups <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> associates <unk> confirm the trend
their junk funds combined have had net outflows totaling nearly n million or about <unk> of their junk fund assets in the past two months
some fund managers say n negative publicity has exacerbated investors concern about recent declines in junk - bond prices
people have been seeing headline after headline after headline and saying i ca n't take it anymore i getting out says <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> investment adviser
the withdrawals could spell trouble for the <unk> billion junk market
if the heavy outflows continue fund managers will face increasing pressure to sell off some of their junk to pay departing investors in the weeks ahead
such selling could erode prices of high - yield junk bonds already weakened by a rash of corporate credit problems
mutual fund groups have n't lost control of much of the outgoing money says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> president
mutual fund officials say that investors have transferred most of it into their money market accounts and to a lesser extent government - bond funds
so the impact on the <unk> billion mutual fund industry as a whole probably will be slight
but tremors are likely in the junk - bond market which has helped to finance the takeover boom of recent years
mutual funds are the among the largest holders of junk accounting for more than a quarter of the entire high - yield high - risk market
the n mutual funds investing solely in junk bonds hold assets of about <unk> billion
other funds hold a smattering of junk bonds too
the n billion <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has had a net outflow of about n million in the past two months
about n million streamed out last week alone double the level of the week following last month <unk> <unk> credit squeeze
about <unk> of the outflow was transferred to other <unk> funds says <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> vice president marketing with most going into money market funds
you get a news item it hits you have strong redemptions that day and for two days following then go back to normal says <unk> <unk>
the fund with a cash cushion of more than <unk> has met all the redemptions without having to sell one thing <unk> <unk> says
he adds our fund has had positive net sales every month for the last three years until this month
<unk> <unk> billion <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has seen n million flow out since early <unk> n million of that seeped out <unk> <unk> n alone
still two - thirds of the outflow has been steered into other <unk> portfolios says <unk> <unk> <unk> a vice president
the fund now holds a cash position of about <unk>
at the n million <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> investors yanked out about n million in the past two months
those withdrawals most of which were transferred to other <unk> <unk> <unk> funds followed little change in the fund sales picture this year through <unk>
the last two months have been the whole ball game says <unk> <unk> a vice president
junk - fund holders have barely broken even this year as fat interest payments barely managed to offset declining prices
through <unk> n high - yield funds had an average n total return the price change plus dividends on fund shares according to <unk> <unk> services <unk>
that even less than the <unk> total return of the <unk> <unk> <unk> - <unk> <unk>
<unk> junk fund has fallen <unk> this year through <unk> n <unk> says <unk> the <unk> fund rose n and the <unk> <unk> <unk> fund edged up <unk>
people who remain in junk funds now could get hit again some analysts and fund specialists say n
many funds in recent weeks and months have been selling their highest - quality junk issues such as <unk> <unk> to raise cash to meet expected redemptions
funds might be forced to accept lower prices if they expand their selling to the securities of less - creditworthy borrowers
and then asset values of the funds could plunge more than they have so far

the surprise resignation yesterday of british <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> sent sterling into a tailspin against the dollar by creating uncertainties about the direction of the british economy
the <unk> unit also firmed against other currencies on the back of sterling tumble as market participants switched out of pounds
the pound also dropped precipitously against the mark falling below the key <unk> level to n marks from n marks late <unk>
<unk> <unk> resignation shocked many analysts despite the recent recurring speculation of a rift between the chancellor and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
indeed only hours earlier <unk> <unk> had called <unk> <unk> economic policies sound and said <unk> she has always supported him
there was a general feeling that we seen the worst said <unk> <unk> deputy chief economic adviser for <unk> <unk> in <unk>
the resignation came as a great surprise
<unk> <unk> manager of foreign - exchange operations at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> added that <unk> <unk> comments reinforced the market growing confidence about sterling and compounded the unit later decline
the market was caught totally the wrong way
everyone was extremely long on sterling <unk> <unk> said
in late <unk> <unk> trading yesterday the dollar was quoted at n marks up from <unk> marks late <unk> and at <unk> yen up from <unk> yen late <unk>
sterling was quoted at <unk> sharply down from <unk> late <unk>
in <unk> <unk> the <unk> currency opened for trading at <unk> yen up from <unk> <unk> close of <unk> yen
few analysts had much good n to say about the pound near - term prospects despite the fact that most do n't anticipate a shift in <unk> <unk> economic policies
<unk> <unk> of <unk> noted that <unk> <unk> replacement <unk> <unk> the british foreign minister will take time <unk> to establish his credibility and in the meantime sterling could trend downward in volatile trade
but <unk> <unk> predicted few economic policy changes ahead commenting that <unk> <unk> shares a very similar view of the world with <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> chief economist at <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> also noted that the pound sharp decline is pegged more to uncertainty in the market than a vision of altered <unk> <unk> economic policies
unless <unk> <unk> resignation leads to a change in british interest - rate policy <unk> <unk> administration firmly supports high interest rates to keep inflation in check or posturing toward full inclusion in the <unk> <unk> <unk> exchange - rate mechanism <unk> <unk> withdrawal will have little long - term impact on exchange rates <unk> <unk> concluded <unk>
also announcing his resignation <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> economic adviser and <unk> <unk> nemesis
the pound which had been trading at about <unk> in <unk> <unk> prior to <unk> <unk> announcement sank more than two cents to <unk> prompting the <unk> <unk> <unk> to buy pounds for dollars
the <unk> move however only proved a stopgap to the pound slide and the <unk> intervened for a second time at around <unk> according to <unk> <unk> traders
meanwhile dollar trading was relatively uninspired throughout the session according to dealers who noted that <unk> release of the preliminary report on the <unk> third - quarter gross national product was something of a nonevent
<unk> <unk> rose at an annual rate of n in the third quarter
the implicit price deflator a measure of inflation was down to a n annual rate of increase in the quarter from a n rate of gain in the second quarter

on an office wall of the <unk> intelligence committee hangs a quote from <unk> <unk> <unk> do n't hold your ticket the show over
he once used that line in a closed - door meeting on <unk> meaning n do n't shrink from taking action against <unk> <unk>
so how did a good senator like this end up approving a policy that required the <unk> to warn <unk> <unk> of any coup plot against him
i agree it ridiculous says <unk> <unk> and indeed by now ridiculous may be the only way n to describe how the <unk> decides to take or rather not to take covert action
<unk> <unk> disclosed the policy last week by reading it to <unk> senators perhaps as a way of shifting blame for the <unk> fiasco to <unk>
but the broader truth is more complicated and dismaying
the policy was contained in an exchange of letters last <unk> between the <unk> intelligence committee and the <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
staff lawyers for both sides were busy agreeing with one another about what the <unk> could not do to oust the panamanian thug
they simply got carried away with interpreting what the executive order banning assassinations really meant
<unk> <unk> himself did n't discover the warn - your-enemy nuance until <unk> <unk> told him privately at the <unk> <unk> last week
it ironic that <unk> <unk> should be in the center of this mire
a former <unk> governor he a thoughtful defender of presidential powers in foreign policy
he a rare democratic hawk
he the senator most like <unk> <unk> the <unk> senator from <unk> who worked to forge a bipartisan foreign policy in the n
<unk> and <unk> are heroes of mine <unk> <unk> says referring as well to <unk> <unk> the democratic <unk> speaker who cooperated with <unk> <unk>
they allowed this country to be credible
i really want to see that happen again
if this were <unk> <unk> <unk> might even succeed
but in n most senators have other ideas
last <unk> his committee rejected a <unk> administration plan to support a coup in <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> refused to support any plan that might get people hurt a charming notion for a great power
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> the plan might violate the assassination ban
so the administration dropped it
by <unk> when the committee rejected a much more modest covert proposal even the administration was agreeing n little should be done
<unk> <unk> does n't think n all this influenced the failed coup this month but he does concede that <unk> has made mistakes
in the aftermath of <unk> in the aftermath of <unk> - <unk> i can understand n some people might think that if they plan a coup they have to bring their lawyers he says
but even <unk> <unk> defends congressional oversight
writing in the <unk> <unk> <unk> he says that his committee approves covert operations only when there a consensus
so what does consensus mean
it does n't mean unanimous he insists though he implies n it means a bipartisan majority
the sustainability of <unk> foreign policy is essential he explains
why was containment so successful
because it had bipartisan support
<unk> <unk> is confusing consensus on general principles with agreement on specific actions
<unk> <unk> a veteran of intelligence committee debates doubts that even <unk> or the libyan raid would have taken place if consensus had been required
<unk> and <unk> were wise enough to leave specific operations to presidents modern senators <unk> <unk> notwithstanding are less modest
the result is that the <unk> committee has what amounts to veto power over every covert action
i would n't say n it quite a veto <unk> <unk> demurs
but would n't a president who acted despite <unk> objections be taking grave political risks
he would agrees the chairman
but that is something n the president ought to know before he goes ahead
<unk> <unk> even spies a silver lining
he figures n the episode will help clarify any ambiguities between the committee and administration
he points to a letter on his desk his second in a week from <unk> <unk> saying that they do n't disagree
more broadly <unk> <unk> hopes that <unk> will shock <unk> out of its fear of using military power
maybe this will jolt us out of the post - <unk> syndrome that we never are prepared to use force he says
maybe if every senator shared the principles of <unk> <unk>
but it just as plausible to argue that if even <unk> <unk> can get mired in this sort of mess the problem goes beyond legal interpretation
maybe the problem is a political system that wo n't act without an exchange of letters that insists on running foreign policy by committee that treats a president as just another guy at the table
the reply of the metzenbaums and cohens is that we ca n't abolish these oversight committees because we seen too many abuses of executive power
but <unk> illustrates that their substitute is a system that produces an absurd gridlock
the lawyers are now in charge of our national security
in <unk> the <unk> interests at stake were happily minor the only people killed were foreigners hapless enough to trust american will
americans may not be so lucky the next time
i was impressed by the perceptiveness of your <unk> n story <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> n to hoe
we lived in rural areas many years but now live in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
this morning as i drove the n miles to my law office and endured the routine heavy traffic during that twice - daily journey i thought of how fortunate it was that we made the decision to be residents of an expanding community with so many opportunities and where so much is happening
the presence of so many people cars and competing businesses is evidence of a healthy economy in a place where people want to live
i thought back to our time in small sparsely populated communities
i remembered how hard it was for an outsider to become accepted by long - established stake - holding residents and what pitfalls awaited an original thinker in societies that were long accustomed to unchanging safe ways of thought and action
i remembered being fired at age n with five children at home when my views and actions were deemed unsettling by a timid small - town employer
how difficult it is for a thinking person to live among societies rooted in the past
now i revel in the freedom culture activity and diversity of this great metropolitan area with its traffic jams and perpetual road - building projects
yet when my youngest child died two years ago i buried him in the church cemetery of a small <unk> town
so after all even the bitterest critic of rural exclusivity harbors a continuing yearning for those scarce rural virtues thought to exist amid fields forests and country lanes

finnish government officials are negotiating with creditors of <unk> <unk> <unk> a major shipyard that filed for bankruptcy protection this week amid confusion and mounting doubts that collapse of the nation entire shipbuilding industry can be averted
at stake are almost n jobs in an industry that has been the mainstay of <unk> post - war economic revival
shipbuilding became a point of pride as finnish shipyards remained profitable long after rivals collapsed all over <unk>
but if as many now fear <unk> <unk> joins the ranks of failed shipyards it might turn out to be remembered most as a blemish on <unk> international reputation
the shipyard n billion finnish markka n billion backlog includes about n ships ordered by big international shippers including three for <unk> <unk> lines <unk>
<unk> - based <unk> said n the first of the three ships is scheduled to be delivered next month just in time for the winter tourist season in the <unk>
the second ship is scheduled to be delivered in fall n and the third in fall n
one analyst said <unk> the first ship probably will be delivered close to schedule but that <unk> may have to pay up to n more to get the second and third ships
all the ships are covered by loan guarantees from a state export financing agency even though it not clear whether they will actually be built
bankers worry that if the government makes good a threat to withdraw its guarantee commitments shippers will counter with a hail of lawsuits
state loan guarantees are rarely a source of controversy
however some bankers cited possible parallels between the <unk> <unk> case and the collapse of <unk> state - owned <unk> <unk> <unk> two years ago
in that case international banks and investors incurred big losses because they incorrectly believed n the company debt carried implicit state guarantees
doubts about the quality of state credit guarantees could reduce the competitive strength of finnish companies in world markets where financing often is the key to winning orders analysts warn <unk>
moreover state - owned finnish companies lacking formal state guarantees could face greater difficulty raising funds in international financial markets bankers say n
the decision by a majority of state - appointed <unk> <unk> directors <unk> to file for bankruptcy was an abrupt about - face from previous government policy
in <unk> the government played a major part in a sweeping restructuring of the troubled shipyard
at the time <unk> by <unk> <unk> a conglomerate the shipbuilding unit faced potential losses estimated at one billion markka and was on the brink of liquidation
under the rescue plan <unk> sold <unk> of its stake to a group of banks and pension funds
the government in turn guaranteed financing to complete the order backlog and took control of the board
government officials were expected to combine <unk> <unk> with two other struggling firms and thus ensure <unk> survival as a shipbuilding nation
the government spent most of last year attempting to carry out such a plan but was thwarted when the parent <unk> concern pulled out at the last minute
after the restructuring of <unk> <unk> and bolstered by state loan guarantees two big bank creditors <unk> <unk> of <unk> and state - controlled <unk> resumed lending the shipyard working capital
but the bankers got cold feet recently as government officials complained <unk> they had been misled about the shipyard actual financial condition and hinted n the credit guarantees might be withdrawn
people familiar with <unk> board meeting said <unk> it was the state refusal to explicitly reaffirm the credit guarantees that led <unk> <unk> and <unk> to halt lending to <unk> <unk>
then in a boardroom showdown state - appointed directors voted to file for bankruptcy apparently under instructions from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
analysts say <unk> <unk> <unk> had grown increasingly worried about the state potential financial exposure as <unk> <unk> losses ballooned to more than double the figure estimated in <unk>
noting that <unk> wound up wasting state subsidies of about n billion swedish kronor n billion during the n in a vain attempt to salvage its shipbuilding industry one analyst suggested that <unk> <unk> may have decided to cut <unk> losses once and for all
senior ministry officials huddled with creditors during the week in an attempt to agree on some form of restructuring that would keep <unk> <unk> operating
the talks may drag on for weeks before any concrete result is announced people familiar with them said n
one solution would be to sell the shipyard to an outsider
but there appear to be few if any suitors
indeed the potential losses make any rescue scheme unlikely unless the politicians once again change tack and agree to pick up the bill analysts said n
meantime shippers with vessels on order from <unk> <unk> will remain in limbo
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said n it expects to report an extraordinary loss of about n million in the fourth quarter due to early retirement of debt
the cable programmer said <unk> the loss will consist primarily of prepayment penalties and unamortized issue discount and costs related to its just - completed n billion refinancing of its long - term debt and some preferred stock in one of its subsidiaries
a <unk> spokesman would n't speculate on the extent of the charge effect on the quarter earnings but said n the company continues to expect to report a net loss for <unk>
the company said <unk> the repayment or redemption of the long - term debt and the outstanding <unk> <unk> cumulative exchangeable preferred stock of <unk> <unk> <unk> was made possible by an offering of about n million of debentures and notes and n million in bank borrowings
the offering included <unk> million of <unk> senior subordinated debentures due n and n million of zero coupon liquid yield option notes due n
the notes were priced to yield n and are convertible into the company <unk> <unk> common stock at a price which represents a <unk> premium over the market price on <unk> n <unk>
in addition the company called its <unk> <unk> senior subordinated notes due n with an aggregate principal amount of n million for redemption on <unk> n
as a result of the refinancing the company said <unk> the interest on the debt will fall to slightly more than <unk> from slightly more than <unk>
in <unk> <unk> <unk> composite trading <unk> <unk> <unk> stock closed at <unk> down n cents
<unk> motors <unk> said n it will temporarily idle its <unk> <unk> assembly plant for one week beginning <unk> because of slow sales
the closing will affect about <unk> workers and eliminate production of n cars
the assembly plant builds the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
in addition <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said n slow sales are forcing it to close its <unk> assembly plant the week beginning <unk>
the plant builds chassis for recreational vehicles and about <unk> workers will be affected by the closing

the government is sharpening its newest weapon against white - collar defendants the power n to prevent them from paying their legal bills
and defense lawyers are warning that they wo n't stick around if they do n't get paid
the issue has come to a boil in <unk> <unk> where federal prosecutors have warned lawyers for <unk> <unk> that if the founder and former chairman of <unk> <unk> <unk> is indicted the government may move to seize the money that <unk> <unk> is using to pay legal fees
the warning by the <unk> attorney office follows two decisions by the <unk> <unk> <unk> last <unk>
in those cases the high court ruled that federal law gives prosecutors broad authority n to seize assets of people accused of racketeering and drug - related crimes including fees paid to lawyers before an indictment
if the government succeeds in seizing <unk> <unk> assets he could be left without top - flight legal representation because his attorneys are likely to quit according to individuals familiar with the case
a seizure also would make the case the largest and one of the first in which lawyers fees have been confiscated in a prosecution unrelated to drugs
the people who suffer in the short run are defendants but the people who suffer in the long run are all of the people because there wo n't be a vigorous private bar n to defend the <unk> of rights says <unk> <unk> a criminal defense attorney who says n he has turned down a number of cases to avoid possible fee seizures
<unk> <unk> is being investigated by a federal grand jury in <unk> where prosecutors have told him that they may soon seek an indictment on racketeering and securities fraud charges
under the <unk> <unk> and <unk> organizations law or <unk> the government has the authority n to seek to freeze or seize a defendant assets before trial
according to individuals familiar with <unk> <unk> case prosecutors issued their warning this week after one of <unk> <unk> attorneys asked whether legal fees might be subject to seizure
in a letter prosecutors told <unk> <unk> lawyers that because of the recent <unk> <unk> rulings they could expect that any fees collected from <unk> <unk> may be seized
prosecutors have told <unk> <unk> attorneys that they believe <unk> <unk> <unk> allegedly ill - gotten gains are so great that any money n he has used to pay attorneys derives from illegal activities
therefore they said n the money can be taken from the lawyers even after they are paid
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> attorneys for <unk> <unk> both declined to comment on the matter
in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said i do n't think n there any legal reason n to limit forfeiture of attorney fees to drug cases
<unk> <unk> said <unk> his office just responded to an attorney question about whether we would go after attorney fees and that is different from actually doing it although we reserve that right
<unk> <unk> was charged last month in a civil suit filed in federal court in <unk> by the securities and <unk> <unk>
in that suit the <unk> accused <unk> <unk> of engaging in a massive financial fraud to overstate the earnings of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> over a three - year period
through his lawyers <unk> <unk> has denied allegations in the <unk> suit and in civil suits previously filed by shareholders against <unk> <unk> and others
the <unk> has alleged that <unk> <unk> aimed to pump up the company stock price through false financial statements in order to sell his stake and reap huge profits
<unk> <unk> the <unk> said n made more than n million from the sale of his shares between <unk> and <unk>
the <unk> <unk> has emphasized that the government fee - forfeiture power is to be used sparingly
according to department policy prosecutors must make a strong showing that lawyers fees came from assets tainted by illegal profits before any attempts at seizure are made
still criminal defense lawyers worry that defendants are being deprived of their <unk> <unk> right to counsel and a fair trial if the government can seize lawyers fees
they also worry that if the government applies asset - forfeiture laws broadly the best defense lawyers will be unwilling to take criminal cases unless they are assured of being paid
the stock market correction of <unk> <unk> <unk> was a grim reminder of the <unk> n n market collapse
since like earthquakes stock market disturbances will always be with us it is prudent to take all possible precautions against another such market collapse
in general markets function well and adjust smoothly to changing economic and financial circumstances
but there are times when they seize up and panicky sellers can not find buyers
that just what happened in the <unk> <unk> crash
as the market tumbled disorderly market conditions prevailed the margins between buying bids and selling bids widened trading in many stocks was suspended orders took unduly long to be executed and many specialists stopped trading altogether
these failures in turn contributed to the fall in the market averages <unk> extracted an extra risk premium and margin - calls triggered additional selling pressures
the situation was like that of a skier who is thrown slightly off balance by an unexpected bump on the slope
his skis spread farther and farther apart just as buy - sell spreads widen during a financial panic and soon he is out of control
unable to stop his accelerating descent he crashes
after the <unk> crash and as a result of the recommendations of many studies circuit breakers were devised to allow market participants to regroup and restore orderly market conditions
it doubtful though whether circuit breakers do any real good
in the additional time n they provide even more order imbalances might pile up as would - be sellers finally get their broker on the phone
instead an appropriate institution should be charged with the job of preventing chaos in the market the <unk> <unk>
the availability of timely assistance of a backstop can help markets retain their resilience
the <unk> already buys and sells foreign exchange to prevent disorderly conditions in foreign - exchange markets
the <unk> has assumed a similar responsibility in the market for government securities
the stock market is the only major market without a market - maker of unchallenged liquidity or a buyer of last resort
this does not mean that the <unk> <unk> does not already play an important indirect role in the stock market
in n it pumped billions into the markets through open market operations and the discount window
it lent money to banks and encouraged them to make funds available to brokerage houses
they in turn lent money to their customers who were supposed to recognize the opportunity <unk> to make a profit in the turmoil and buy shares
the <unk> also has the power n to set margin requirements
but would n't it be more efficient and effective to supply such support to the stock market directly
instead of flooding the entire economy with liquidity and thereby increasing the danger of inflation the <unk> could support the stock market directly by buying market averages in the futures market thus stabilizing the market as a whole
the stock market is certainly not too big for the <unk> to handle
the foreign - exchange and government securities markets are vastly larger
daily trading volume in the <unk> <unk> foreign exchange market is <unk> billion
the daily volume for <unk> <unk> is about n billion
the combined value of daily equity trading on the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> over - the-counter market ranges between <unk> billion and n billion
the <unk> billion n the <unk> injected into the money markets after the <unk> crash is more than enough to buy all the stocks traded on a typical day
more carefully targeted intervention might actually reduce the need for government action
and taking more direct action has the advantage of avoiding sharp increases in the money supply such as happened in <unk> n
the <unk> stock market role ought not to be very ambitious
it should seek only to maintain the functioning of markets not to prop up the <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> averages at a particular level
the <unk> should guard against systemic risk but not against the risks inherent in individual stocks
it would be inappropriate for the government or the central bank to buy or sell <unk> or <unk> motors shares
instead the <unk> could buy the broad market composites in the futures market
the increased demand would normalize trading and stabilize prices
stabilizing the derivative markets would tend to stabilize the primary market
the <unk> would eliminate the cause of the potential panic rather than attempting to treat the symptom the liquidity of the banks
disorderly market conditions could be observed quite frequently in foreign exchange markets in the <unk> and <unk>
but since the member countries of the <unk> <unk> <unk> agreed to the guidelines to floating in <unk> such difficulties have been avoided
i can not recall any disorder in currency markets since the <unk> guidelines were adopted
thus the mere existence of a market - stabilizing agency helps to avoid panic in emergencies
the old saying advises if it ai n't broke do n't fix it
but this could be a case where we all might go broke if it is n't fixed
<unk> <unk> now at <unk> <unk> was a governor of the <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> until earlier this year
this is adapted from a speech to the <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
<unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> - <unk> urged banks to be cautious in financing leveraged buy - outs
caution should be the rule of the day said <unk> <unk> - <unk> in a speech to the <unk> of <unk> treasurers annual dinner
it would be damaging to industry and to the financial sector in general to say nothing of banks if prudence does not guide the financing of leveraged transactions
his remarks were distributed to the press before <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> announced his resignation last evening
<unk> of <unk> officials said n the central bank had no comment on <unk> <unk> resignation
<unk> <unk> - <unk> reiterated that the exposure of <unk> <unk> banks to leveraged deals have n't yet reached worrying levels
however in light of the risks involved in such transactions banks should satisfy themselves that they have the skills <unk> to participate in this market and clear policy guidelines on acceptable levels of exposure to such transactions he said n
in other comments he said n takeovers may not always be the most efficient way of securing a change of corporate direction or strategy
a similar result could sometimes be achieved at less cost by changing managements he said
<unk> <unk> most powerful computer chip has flaws that could delay several computer makers marketing efforts but the bugs are n't expected to hurt <unk> and most computer makers
computer experts familiar with the flaws found in <unk> <unk> chip say <unk> the defects do n't affect the average user and are likely to be cleared up before most computers using the chip as their brains appear on the market sometime next year
<unk> said that last week a customer discovered two flaws in its n microprocessor chip floating - point unit a set of circuits that do certain calculations
on <unk> <unk> began notifying customers about the bugs which cause the chip to give wrong answers for some mathematical calculations
but while <unk> <unk> machines <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> say <unk> the bugs will delay products most big computer makers said n the flaws do n't affect them
bugs like this are just a normal part of product development said <unk> <unk> director of <unk> - <unk> <unk> advanced systems development
<unk> announced last week that it planned to ship a computer based on the <unk> chip early next year
these bugs do n't affect our schedule at all he said
likewise <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> microsystems <unk> said <unk> the bugs wo n't delay their development of <unk> machines
we have n't modified our schedules in any way said a <unk> spokesman
to switch to another vendor chips would definitely not be an option he said n
nonetheless concern about the chip may have been responsible for a decline of <unk> cents in <unk> stock to <unk> a share yesterday in over - the-counter trading on volume of n shares and partly responsible for a drop in <unk> stock in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> composite trading on <unk>
yesterday <unk> plunged further closing at <unk> a share off <unk> a share on volume of n shares
most of <unk> decline is being attributed to a third - quarter earnings report that came in at the low end of analysts expectations
<unk> said n it had corrected the problems and would start producing bugless chips next week
we should not be seeing any more said <unk> <unk> <unk> director for the <unk> chip
what more the bugs only emerge on esoteric applications such as computer - aided design and scientific calculations he said <unk> and then very seldom
these errata do not affect business programs he said
the bugs will cause problems in specific and rare circumstances that will not occur in typical applications such as word - processing and spreadsheets said <unk> <unk> <unk> editor of the <unk> <unk> an industry newsletter
<unk> <unk> - <unk> and others say n <unk> is n't wholly to blame for the snafu
the real culprits they said n are computer makers such as <unk> that have jumped the gun to unveil n products
the reason n this is getting so much visibility is that some started shipping and announced early availability said <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk>
you can do that but you taking a risk
those companies are paying the price for taking the risk
in late <unk> <unk> began shipping a plug - in card that converts its <unk> model n from a <unk> machine to an n machine
an <unk> spokeswoman said n the company told customers <unk> about the bugs and temporarily stopped shipping the product
<unk> has no plans to recall its add - on cards the spokeswoman said n and could probably circumvent the bugs without long product delays
we do n't look at this as a major problem for us she said
<unk> which said n it discovered the bugs still plans to announce new n products on <unk> n
because of the glitch however the company said <unk> it does n't know when its machine will be commercially available
that a break from <unk> tradition because the company does n't announce products until they actually at the dealers
the problem is being ballyhooed experts say n because the n is <unk> future flagship
<unk> microprocessors are the chips of choice in many of today personal computers and the n microprocessor is the spearhead of the company bid to guard that spot in the next generation of machines
although these sorts of bugs are not at all uncommon the n is an extremely high - profile product said <unk> <unk> the newsletter editor
<unk> <unk> chip is the corvette of <unk> microprocessors a super - fast super - expensive chip that only the most power - hungry computer users are likely to buy for at least several years
unveiled last <unk> the chip crams n million transistors on a sliver of silicon more than four times as many as on <unk> earlier model n
<unk> clocks the chip speed at n million instructions per second or mips
that four times as fast as the n
machines using the <unk> are expected to challenge higher - priced work stations and minicomputers in applications such as so - called servers which connect groups of computers together and in computer - aided design
but while the chip speed in processing power is dazzling it real strength lies in its software inheritance
the n is the descendant of a long series of <unk> chips that began dominating the market ever since <unk> picked the <unk> <unk> chip for its first personal computer
a n microprocessor processes <unk> pieces of data at a time and is slower than newer n chips
since then <unk> has cornered a large part of the market with successive generations of <unk> and <unk> chips all of which can run software written for previous models
that what will keep computer makers coming in spite of the irritation of bugs
big personal computer makers and many makers of engineering workstations are developing <unk> machines which are expected to reach the market early next year
of the big computer makers only <unk> <unk> <unk> bases its machines on <unk> chips instead
the n is going to have a big impact on the industry said <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk>
it going to be the leading edge technology in personal computers for the next few years
this bug is not going to have any affect on that at all
<unk> <unk> in <unk> contributed to this article
<unk> <unk> <unk> has agreed in principle to form a joint venture with the world second - largest steelmaker <unk> - <unk> of <unk> to modernize a portion of <unk> ailing <unk> division
the venture which involves adding sophisticated equipment n to make cast - iron mill rolls is part of a two - pronged effort n to shore up a division that has posted continuing operating losses for several years
the other element includes consolidating <unk> press - forge operations
the entire division employs about n workers
while the joint venture affects only a small part of <unk> operations it is significant because it marks the first time n the nation no . n steelmaker has joined forces with a foreign partner
<unk> <unk> analysts have criticized <unk> for not following its major competitors in linking with a foreign company to share costs and provide technology n to modernize old facilities or build new ones
we think n it a step in the right direction for <unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> international steel analyst
it important to share the risk and even more so when the market has already peaked
he said n the move could be the beginning of a broader relationship between the two companies one that could open up new markets for <unk>
<unk> had little choice but to go with a european steelmaker because its competitors already have tapped the japanese and south korean industry leaders analysts noted n
under terms of the agreement <unk> <unk> - <unk> unit and <unk> would establish a modernized facility n to make cast - iron mill rolls at the company cast - iron shop here
terms for the venture which would be jointly owned by both companies were n't disclosed
the <unk> unit has agreed to provide technology and expertise to install a so - called spin caster by early next fall
the caster improves the metallurgical quality of the iron mill rolls which are basically huge rolling pins used to flatten or shape steel products
<unk> is also working with the <unk> steelworkers union to consolidate <unk> two machine shops and four heat - treatment facilities of the press - forge operations
once the consolidation is complete <unk> plans to concentrate its forgings business on nuclear fabrication hardened steel and large - diameter steel rolls for rolling mills and selected custom - die applications
<unk> said earlier this year that it planned to restructure the <unk> division to improve its cost structure
in the second quarter <unk> posted a n million charge related to its plans to realign the division
if you still wondering about the causes of the slump in the junk - bond market consider the case of <unk> <unk> <unk>
the <unk> thrift has just announced a n million third - quarter loss
how did this happen
well when <unk> in its recent s&l bailout mandated that the thrifts sell off all their junk - bond holdings by n it not only artificially increased the supply of these bonds in the market but also eliminated one of the few profitable investments n thrifts have made
but there is a grimly ironic twist to the <unk> loss
as followers of the debate over a capital - gains tax cut know there is much talk in <unk> and indeed all over <unk> about the need to encourage long - term investment and discourage the financial sector presumed obsession with the short term
now we regard this as a largely phony issue but the long term is nonetheless a big salon topic all around the <unk>
it turns out that <unk> had this huge loss in large part because the new congressionally mandated rules forced it to adjust the book value of its soon - to-be-sold junk bonds to the lower of either their cost or market value
they could no longer be classified as what <unk> regarded them namely long - term investments
<unk> ham - handed treatment of the existing structure of junk - bond holdings reminds us of a story in the <unk> earlier this year about the <unk> <unk> companies desire to have the court - ordered bans lifted on offering information services
the issue of seeking relief from <unk> was raised to <unk> <unk> the chairman of <unk>
<unk> <unk> replied <unk> tends to be compromised
i believe n we have to take a shot at getting as much done as we can through the court through justice and through state and federal regulatory agencies
i see <unk> as a last resort
healthy thrifts such as <unk> or the junk - bond market itself should have been so lucky
the reality of life in modern <unk> is that if you want to wreck something that works let it fall into the hands of <unk>
<unk> <unk> said n it will move its headquarters from <unk> to <unk>
most of the <unk> employees at the oil company midtown headquarters building including much of senior management were unaware of the plan until informed at a morning meeting by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the shift wo n't affect operations
as part of its restructuring several years ago <unk> moved most of those out of the city and sold its <unk> <unk> <unk> skyscraper to a japanese company
but the pullout is an embarrassment to <unk> <unk> <unk> officials coming at a time of high office building vacancy rates and departures by other major companies
<unk> <unk> is in the process of vacating its headquarters here and huge operations like <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> airlines have recently left
<unk> <unk> authorities informed yesterday about the move reacted with concern and even some anger to the idea of the nation third - largest corporation leaving without giving them an opportunity to accommodate it
we are dismayed but there nothing n we can do about it now said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> deputy mayor for finance and economic development
meanwhile <unk> welcomed the move
city officials there had been were aware that a large company was moving in but negotiations had all been conducted through a law firm and under the code name everglades
when we were told n it was <unk> it was beyond all expectations what a coup said <unk> <unk> senior vice president of <unk> <unk> the economic development affiliate of the city <unk> of <unk>
<unk> its economy based on oil and real estate has been in a slump
<unk> said <unk> it will build a new headquarters on a n tract in the <unk> <unk> <unk> complex in the suburb of <unk>
until the building is completed <unk> will rent part of an existing office tower
<unk> <unk> once a huge <unk> ranch is a sprawling complex of office buildings homes and recreational facilities that its developers have been struggling to populate in recent years
<unk> officials said n it will cost less to run its headquarters at <unk> <unk> than in <unk> <unk>
the company wo n't say how much it will save but during at its interim location sources say n it will likely pay rent of <unk> to n per square foot
owners of the building in <unk> <unk> say n they will be asking n per square foot for rent to fill the space that <unk> is vacating
in <unk> taxes and development costs are also lower they said n
plus one <unk> official said n by eliminating the typically long <unk> <unk> commutes between office and home management will expect employees to work n hours a week in <unk> rather than a n work week in <unk> <unk>
canadian production of market pulp rose n in <unk> from a year earlier as the industry operated at <unk> of capacity
the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> an industry group said <unk> <unk> mills produced <unk> metric tons of market pulp in <unk> compared with <unk> metric tons a year earlier
market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to producers of paper and other products
the statistics exclude pulp consumed at the producing mill or shipped to another mill that is affiliated with the producing mill
<unk> is the world largest producer of market pulp
the <unk> n operating rate compared with a rate of n in <unk> but was unchanged from a year earlier
in the first nine months of this year output was <unk> metric tons down from <unk> metric tons a year earlier
<unk> holdings <unk> completed its n billion acquisition of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> purchasing n million shares or n of the <unk> <unk> - based health - care services concern for <unk> a share
the price also includes assumption of about <unk> billion in debt
<unk> is a group that includes <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> family of <unk> through the leveraged buy - out fund <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> partners
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> along with five other <unk> designees were named to join <unk> <unk> <unk> board
the completion of the merger agreement follows months of twists and turns
in <unk> <unk> <unk> brought in a new chief executive officer <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who will remain as chairman president and chief executive
a few days later <unk> <unk> announced sharply lower earnings taking charges of n million for insurance reserves and canceled real estate leases
in <unk> <unk> <unk> received a n offer to take the company private from an investor group including large holder <unk> <unk> <unk>
it also was considering a restructuring n to help boost the stock price
a group including several members of the the <unk> family of <unk> urged the company to take some steps n to maximize shareholder value
the following month the company put itself up for sale
it received more offers but the auction was surprisingly won by <unk> which bid n a share and asked <unk> <unk> to stay on as an equity participant
he indicated that some assets might be sold off to service the debt
then after extending its offer four times waiting for a congressional tax ruling <unk> early this month lowered its offer to <unk> a share amid turbulence in the junk bond market
<unk> <unk> accepted the offer meanwhile indicating <unk> it had heard from two other suitors
but they never materialized and <unk> completed the purchase yesterday
other new board members include <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said that <unk> should grant the securities and <unk> <unk> the power to close the stock markets in periods of crisis
in testimony to the <unk> securities subcommittee <unk> <unk> disputed the view of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who told a <unk> panel <unk> that he does n't want the ability to halt the markets
<unk> <unk> contended that discretionary power could have an impact on the markets if rumors were to circulate about when the exchanges might be closed
he added that the president already has the power to close the markets in an emergency
but <unk> <unk> argued that the <unk> is closer to the markets and in a better position n to understand when the exchanges are under such stress that they should be closed
separately <unk> <unk> said <unk> he asked the <unk> <unk> on <unk> markets to determine whether futures margins are too low
he noted that some minimum margin requirements have been reduced to levels below those before the <unk> crash
this raises questions whether futures and equity margin requirements are consistent at these levels and whether futures margins are adequate <unk> <unk> said
margins are the amount of money n an investor needs to put up to buy or sell a futures contract
margins on the futures exchanges typically are raised and lowered according to market volatility
the <unk> <unk> <unk> margins for the <unk> <unk> <unk> stock - index futures stood at <unk> a contract for speculators and n for hedgers before <unk> n <unk> that day the hedging margin was raised to <unk>
margins were raised or lowered about a dozen times since the crash <unk> <unk> <unk>
currently they stand at <unk> for speculators who are typically individuals and non - member traders and n for hedgers which are usually institutions and have offsetting positions in the underlying stocks
<unk> <unk> also said n he expects the leveraged buy - out phenomenon to end under its own weight
asked whether there is anything <unk> <unk> should do to curb the lbo boom <unk> <unk> responded i think n the <unk> phenomenon while it wo n't stop completely will be a thing of the past
before taking any action he advised the panel to see what the market has produced as a cure
<unk> <unk> also agreed with senators concerns about recent stock - market volatility and said <unk> he realizes that the gyrations are scaring investors from investing in stocks
but he added that individuals still are participating in the equity market indirectly through mutual funds and pension funds
the former <unk> <unk> executive refused to offer an opinion on the controversy surrounding program trading which has recently become a larger part of the trading in the market and has been blamed for accelerating the drop two weeks ago
i do not have a view of whether we should do anything about program trading at this time he said
but <unk> <unk> endorsed the market - revision bill that both houses of <unk> will try to push through this session
that bill proposed by the <unk> last year would require brokerage firms to disclose the financial positions of their holding companies mandate large traders reporting of program or block trades and improve clearing and settlement of trades between the futures and stock markets
the bill also would give the <unk> the power to close the markets a discretion that former <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> wanted but <unk> <unk> does n't
<unk> <unk> and senators agreed to have their staffs meet within the next week to start fine - tuning the bill
the <unk> <unk> <unk> is responding to trading abuses in the futures markets with a far - reaching bill that would become the futures <unk> practices <unk> of <unk>
the proposed legislation has a laudable goal to assure the integrity of the <unk> futures markets
however as is common with sweeping legislation the proposal contains many provisions that could destroy important parts of the system n it sets out to preserve
the complex bill introduced by <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> covers a wide range of provisions that would affect the funding and authority of the <unk> futures <unk> <unk> and would profoundly change the way n the industry is regulated
these include provisions relating to the technology and systems that must be employed by exchanges oversight and disciplinary procedures for exchange trading practices the relationship between commodity brokerage firms and floor traders and exchange governance
the bill also elevates even minor rule infractions to felonies and provides for recovery of punitive damages in civil lawsuits and arbitration cases without any showing of willful misconduct
many aspects of the bill are salutary providing appropriate public safeguards that can and should be instituted throughout the industry
indeed some of the bill requirements including broad representation on the exchanges boards of directors and strong measures to prevent conflicts of interest already have been put in place by the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other futures exchanges
other aspects of the bill however are either structured in ways that create unnecessary burdens for the industry or actually are harmful to the exchanges the industry and ultimately the general public
one of the most prominent features is the requirement that in three years all exchanges have in place a system that records all trades by a source independent of the executing broker
the <unk> <unk> futures exchanges have been working together to develop a trade recording system much like the one called for in the bill
we would be delighted to have such a system in place today
but is it realistic for <unk> to mandate by a rigid deadline a system that has not yet been subjected to feasibility studies
what if the system does n't work
what if the only system that does work is so expensive that at best only the largest exchanges can afford it
cost is a key consideration because of the global sweep of the financial markets
the <unk> futures exchanges compete world - wide as never before
today trading in almost any commodity can be diverted from <unk> markets with just a few strokes of a keyboard
all foreign markets are aggressively courting <unk> business
in fact several <unk> markets already offer lower costs for trading in the same or very similar contracts
the <unk> exchanges need both market integrity and cost - efficiency long - term growth depends on it
the <unk> bill contains many provisions that will increase the costs of trading
the most arbitrary of these is the imposition of service fees which will directly widen the cost spread between <unk> and foreign markets
other provisions have a more subtle but nonetheless real and detrimental effect on the international position of <unk> exchanges
these include the extension of liability into areas beyond those established by judicial precedent and the expansion of liability n to include punitive damages
in addition to increasing costs as a result of greater financial exposure for members these measures could have other far - reaching repercussions
one section of the bill would make all commodity brokerage firms and floor brokers liable for damages without willful misconduct
nowhere in the federal securities law is simple negligence or inadvertent action a source of liability under similar circumstances
it is only logical to assume that the enactment of this provision will lead to increased litigation
in an already low - profitmargin business commodity brokerage firms may well decide to eliminate the risk and expense of dealing with the retail public depriving the private individual of access to the markets
another measure makes commodity brokerage firms liable for violations committed by independent floor brokers who execute trades for them
this untried concept would expose these firms to potentially astronomical punitive damages
faced with the virtually impossible task of supervising the execution of each trade many commodity brokerage firms are likely to stop doing business with independents and instead hire their own salaried floor brokers
this would force out of business many of the individuals and small firms that function as floor brokers
a consequence of their departure could be a serious diminution of market liquidity
finally under the bill a number of legitimate longstanding business practices would be arbitrarily banned unless the <unk> were to take specific and timely action to permit them to continue
in other words regulation will occur through inaction and happenstance rather than through a normal deliberative procedure
the affected practices include the placing of oral orders which is the way n most public customer orders are placed and trading between affiliated brokers even though in some cases trading with affiliates may be the only way n to obtain the best execution for a client
also precluded would be dual trading whereby a broker trades for customers as well as his own account a practice that provides needed liquidity to the markets
all <unk> futures exchanges agree that these and other trading practices require proper regulation and supervision
nonetheless each has too much potential value to the system to be banned by legislative fiat before the <unk> carefully considers all the consequences of a ban and what the regulatory alternatives are
the markets are complex as is the environment in which they function
when problems surface the temptation becomes strong to summarily overhaul a market system that has served for more than n years
that temptation must be put aside to permit careful consideration of all the implications positive and negative of the proposed resolutions to those problems and to avoid creating a marketplace where no one trades

three novels the beginning and the end n pages n the thief and the dogs n pages <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> pages n recently published by <unk> offer an uneven sample of the <unk> <unk> <unk> talent
but they do show the range of a restless intellect whose n novels span five decades and include work of social realism protest and allegory
they also chart the evolution of a city that has grown tenfold in the author lifetime from a colonial outpost of fez - wearing pashas to a <unk> <unk> slum choking on its own refuse
soon it be so crowded a narrator complains that people will start eating each other
the beginning and the end easily the best of the three belongs to <unk> <unk> realistic period and it is the one for which he is most renowned
published in n it follows the decline of a <unk> family with the saga - like sweep and rich detail that critics often compare to <unk> <unk> and <unk>
a minor bureaucrat dies suddenly dooming his family to poverty and eventual disgrace
his daughter turns to dressmaking then to peddling herself for a few piasters
one son sacrifices his own career so that his avaricious brother can succeed while another helps support the family with money siphoned from crime
the real tragedy though lies not in the family circumstances but in its concern for appearances
mourning for the father is overshadowed by the shame of burying him in a pauper grave
the family moves to another house at night to conceal shabby belongings from neighbors
and the successful son wishes his embarrassing siblings dead
as a critique of middle - class mores the story is heavy - handed
but its unsentimental sketches of <unk> life are vintage <unk>
we see smell and hear slums filled with the echoes of hawkers advertising their wares interspersed with abusive language rattling coughs and the sound of people gathering spittle in their throats and spewing into the street
and we meet engaging crooks such as <unk> the <unk> famed for his head - butting fights his whoring and his hashish
<unk> has not yet ordained that i should have earnings he tells his worried mother
<unk> comes to a bad end but so does almost everyone else in the book
if the setting is exotic the prose is closer to <unk> <unk> <unk> than it is to <unk> nights
<unk> <unk> began writing when there was no novelistic tradition in <unk> and he modeled his work on western classics
in one sense this limits him unlike a writer such as <unk> <unk> <unk> who has a distinctive latin voice <unk> <unk> style offers little that can be labeled egyptian
but the familiarity of his style also makes his work accessible as the streets of <unk> come alive for the western reader as vividly as <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk>
the thief and the dogs written in <unk> is a taut psychological drama reminiscent of <unk> and <unk>
its antihero <unk> <unk> is an egyptian <unk> who seeks nobility in robbing and killing
i am the hope and the dream the redemption of cowards he says in one of many interior monologues
later he recalls the words of his marxist mentor the people theft the holy fire
said story reflects the souring of socialism under <unk> whose dictatorial rule replaced the monarchy overthrown in <unk>
by <unk> <unk> <unk> idealism had vanished or become twisted as it has in <unk>
his giddy dream of redeeming a life of badly aimed bullets by punishing the real robbers the rich dogs who prey on the poor leads only to the death of innocents and eventually to his own
<unk> spirited squalor also has gone gray
here the city is dark and laden with symbolism <unk> has left his jail cell only to enter the larger prison of <unk> society
while the theme is compelling the plot and characters are not
we never care about <unk> or the hypocrites n he hunts
the thief and the <unk> is a pioneering work the first stream - of-consciousness novel in <unk> but it is likely to disappoint western readers
the n novel wedding song also is experimental and another badly aimed bullet
the story of a playwright stage debut unfolds in first - person monologues in the manner of <unk> the <unk> and the <unk>
but the device obscures more than it illuminates
buried in the work is a meditation on the morality of art and on the struggle for integrity in an unfair world
but again the themes get tangled in <unk> <unk> elliptical storytelling
the indirectness of his later work reflects both an appetite for new genres and the hazards of art in the arab world
<unk> <unk> has been pilloried and censored for questioning <unk> and advocating peace with <unk>
veiling his message has helped him endure
<unk> says <unk> the playwright in <unk> <unk> is the surrogate for the action that an idealist like me is unable to take
wedding song gives glimpses of a <unk> that has become so much harsher since his youth when as he once said the poorest person was able to find his daily bread and without great difficulty
the clutter of the n remains but its color has drained away and the will to overcome has been defeated
cars ca n't move because of overflowing sewers
characters complain ceaselessly about food queues prices and corruption
and the ubiquitous opium addict is now a cynical and selfish man who gripes only government ministers can afford it these days

the tentative agreement provides for wage increases of <unk> cents an hour retroactive to <unk> <unk> <unk> and for increases of <unk> cents n cents and n cents an hour effective <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> respectively
it also provides for benefit adjustments including a partial restoration of vacations and holidays as well as work - rule changes to increase productivity
ground zero of the <unk> scandal is the <unk> discretionary fund a honey pot used to fund projects that were n't approved through normal <unk> channels
<unk> <unk> wants to abolish it
instead <unk> idea of reform is to increase this slush fund by n million
and transfer control of much of it to <unk> <unk>
the <unk> scandals will simply continue but under new mismanagement
after one of the most amazing debates n we ever seen on the cable channel <unk> - <unk> the <unk> voted <unk> to n on <unk> to order n million in spending for a <unk> <unk> arts center a <unk> library and <unk> other pet projects out of the same discretionary fund that was supposed to have been so abused during <unk> <unk> tenure
<unk> has no paper work whatsoever on <unk> of the projects none of the others has been approved and not a single congressional hearing has been held on any of them
however four are in the <unk> district of <unk> <unk> <unk> the chairman of the <unk> subcommittee that writes the <unk> spending bill
of course this kind of blatant congressional pork - barreling is called constituent service by members while the same kind of noncompetitive favoritism at <unk> is labeled influence peddling
unlike those awful republican consultants members do n't profit directly from <unk> projects
they merely collect campaign contributions from developers that help keep them in office
the n pet projects were discovered buried in the appropriations bill for <unk> and some other agencies after it returned from a conference committee that was called to resolve differences between the <unk> and <unk> versions
<unk> committees are breeding grounds for mischief
they are often closed to the public and no minutes are taken
members find it easy to doctor legislation by slipping in special provisions that could never survive in the cold light of day
in this case the members outdid themselves
they transferred some n million from the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> program designated largely for low and moderate - income projects and funneled it into such items as n million for a performing - arts center in <unk> n million for job retention in hawaiian sugar mills <unk> for a collapsing utility tunnel in <unk> <unk> for equipment and landscaping n to deter crime and aid police surveillance at a <unk> park <unk> for integrated urban data based in seven cities no other details n for a library and recreation center at <unk> <unk> <unk>

this is slightly adapted from remarks <unk> n by former <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to an alumni gathering at the <unk> <unk> <unk> where he has returned to the faculty
i was struck a couple of years ago by the drug - interdiction effort in the bahamas
we had intercepted during the year an estimated n billion street value of cocaine
i do n't know how much got through
nobody has any credible estimate
the gnp of the bahamas is probably somewhere between one and two billion dollars
so you get an idea of the leverage there and elsewhere that our market for drugs has brought about
i welcome the emphasis that is now being put on the drug problem
the efforts to get to the people who are addicted try to rehabilitate them if they can not be rehabilitated at least to contain them to educate people to strongly discourage use of drugs by people who are casual users and first users to stop this process among the young all of these things i think n are extremely important
but i have to tell you that it seems to me that the conceptual base of the current program is flawed and the program is not likely to work
the conceptual base a criminal - justice approach is the same that i have worked through before in the <unk> administration when i was budget director and secretary of the treasury with jurisdiction over the <unk>
we designed a comprehensive program and we worked hard on it
in the <unk> administration we designed a comprehensive program we worked very hard on it
our international efforts were far greater than ever before
you looking at a guy whose motorcade was attacked in <unk> by the drug terrorists so i personally a veteran of this war
what we have before us now is essentially the same program but with more resources plowed into all of the efforts to enforce and control
these efforts wind up creating a market where the price vastly exceeds the cost
with these incentives demand creates its own supply and a criminal network along with it
it seems to me n we not really going to get anywhere until we can take the criminality out of the drug business and the incentives for criminality out of it
frankly the only way n i can think of n to accomplish this is to make it possible for addicts to buy drugs at some regulated place at a price that approximates their cost
when you do that you wipe out the criminal incentives including i might say the incentive that the drug pushers have to go around and get kids addicted so that they create a market for themselves
they wo n't have that incentive because they wo n't have that market
so i think n the conceptual base needs to be thought out in a different way
if i am catching your attention then read a bold and informative article in this <unk> issue of <unk> by <unk> <unk> on this subject
we need at least to consider and examine forms of controlled legalization of drugs
i find it very difficult to say that
sometimes at a reception or cocktail party i advance these views and people head for somebody else
they do n't even want to talk to you
i know that i shouting into the breeze here as far as what we doing now
but i feel that if somebody does n't get up and start talking about this now the next time around when we have the next iteration of these programs it will still be true that everyone is scared to talk about it
no politician wants to say what i just said not for a minute
the <unk> economy grew at a moderate n annual rate in the third quarter the same pace as the second quarter despite the worst trade performance in six years the <unk> <unk> reported <unk>
personal spending buoyed by a burst of automobile buying was the main catalyst to the economy expansion
but trade one of the economy main forces in the past few years showed a sharp deterioration
imports of goods and services soared while exports were flat
some economists found the mixture ominous
for the past two years the foreign trade sector has been a major contributor to economic growth
you ca n't rely now solely on consumer spending to sustain the economy on a solid growth path said <unk> <unk> chief economist at <unk> <unk> in <unk>
although the economy showed no change of pace from the second quarter many analysts expect it to slow considerably in the fourth quarter as demand for autos falls partly because of higher prices on models introduced last month
many economists think n the rise in the value of the <unk> dollar this year will further crimp progress in trade because it makes exports more expensive and imports cheaper
and business investment which slowed in the third quarter according to yesterday report is expected to continue to be sluggish
a sharp reduction in inflation was by far the brightest spot in the report on the real gross national product the inflation - adjusted market value of all the goods and services n the economy produced
an inflation gauge that measures the quarterly change in prices of an array of goods and services slowed its growth to a n annual rate in the third quarter from <unk> in the second
much of the moderation came from declining energy prices which have since turned up a bit analysts said n
consequently <unk> <unk> undersecretary for economic affairs at the <unk> <unk> said <unk> inflation probably will edge up from the third - quarter rate in the final three months of <unk>
but he said <unk> he believes n the second quarter n rate will prove to have been this year peak quarterly inflation rate
generally the <unk> administration expressed satisfaction with the economy progress as it heads into its eighth year of sustained growth next month
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> called the <unk> pace good solid growth although he said n he expects the expansion to slow in the fourth quarter
he added inflation is lower than i think n people expected it to be and i think n that good news
but administration officials were concerned over the bleak trade report which showed the deficit in the country trade of goods and services swelling to a n billion annual rate in the third quarter from a n billion rate in the second quarter
<unk> <unk> called it a disappointment but predicted n exports will pick up again
we were unprepared for the deterioration in net exports said <unk> <unk> <unk> vice president of <unk> forecasting at <unk> of <unk> in <unk> <unk>
i ca n't believe <unk> it will continue he added noting that the economies of the country major trading partners are strong and prices of <unk> products are still competitive
some analysts also were disturbed by a pickup in the growth of business inventories
while a buildup of these stocks adds to <unk> it can hurt the economy because a pileup of unsold goods can lead to production cuts and layoffs
according to the report inventories outside the farm sector grew at an annual rate of n billion in the third quarter up from a n billion pace in the second quarter
manufacturers stocks fattened at an n billion annual rate up from <unk> billion
that suggests n there is a little more inventory overhang than some people expected said <unk> <unk> senior financial economist at <unk> <unk> in <unk>
i do n't think n it anything that going to cause a downturn in economic activity
but it will slow production
devastation from <unk> <unk> which slammed into the <unk> coast in late <unk> diminished personal income by about <unk> billion the department said n but it called the effect on the roughly n trillion economy negligible
except for the loss from the hurricane all the figures were adjusted for seasonal factors and inflation
here are some of the major components of the gross national product expressed in seasonally adjusted annual rates in billions of constant n dollars
in the third quarter the implicit price deflator fell to n of the <unk> average from <unk> in the previous quarter
<unk> <unk> received a n million contract by the <unk> <unk> <unk> for production tooling and test equipment for the <unk> <unk> defense - suppression missile

the troubles continued in this year first half when profit plunged <unk> to n
<unk> <unk> is one of many small defense contractors besieged by the slowdown in defense spending
unlike larger contractors with a broad enough base n to weather the downturn easily these companies are suffering big drops in business as once - lucrative specialty niches in the massive military market erode or even disappear
companies that only recently were thriving find themselves scrambling to survive
as their varied strategies suggest there is more than one way n to respond to a disaster though it too soon to tell whether the changes will pay off
for many companies the instinctive first response is to cut costs
others are trying to find specialty defense work spared by the slowdown or new niches created by budget - cutting
more venturesome businesses are applying their skills in commercial fields
<unk> <unk> <unk> which provides professional and technical services to the military is refining its defense niche not retreating from it
after quadrupling annual earnings over four years to n million in <unk> the <unk> <unk> company posted a n drop in earnings for this year first half
in the belief that development of advanced military technology will remain a top <unk> <unk> priority <unk> last year acquired <unk> <unk> associates a technical and scientific analysis company with contracts under the <unk> <unk> <unk>
while the <unk> anti - missile program recently awarded <unk> <unk> two contracts totaling n million <unk> chairman and founder <unk> <unk> says n he bought the company more for its technology than its customer
<unk> <unk> an <unk> <unk> contractor that earned n million on revenue of n million in <unk> has gone even further in realigning its military business
as orders for its aircraft and submarine parts dwindled three years of steady growth ended with a n drop in income in this year first half
the company hit on a new strategy if the <unk> <unk> is so intent on saving money why not make money off that trend
among the company current efforts repairing old parts at n of the cost of replacing them
<unk> also is selling new parts if needed directly to the military instead of through a prime contractor
at as little as one - third of the government cost the company is running a program n to train <unk> helicopter pilots
it is also taking over the maintenance of certain <unk> aircraft with <unk> fewer people than the military used
in another approach tiny <unk> <unk> is trying to resume its growth by braving the new world of commercial products
<unk> <unk> chairman says <unk> he hopes n the company can eventually get up to half of its revenue from commercial markets
for now he says n we looking at buying some small companies with niche markets in the personal - computer business

it is an effort to branch out from the government which is very difficult for a defense contractor
<unk> <unk> should know

some companies are cutting costs and hoping for the best
<unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> provider of software - development and hardware - maintenance services to the military enjoyed steady growth until this year
following a tripling of earnings to n million on a doubling of revenue to n million over four years earnings in the company fiscal first quarter which ended <unk> <unk> plunged n to n
a one - time write - off for booking nonexistent revenue was partly to blame but so were lower profits from a stingier contract with the <unk> and delays in getting paid
<unk> responded by combining three of its five divisions to reduce expenses and bring more focus to potentially fewer bidding opportunities says <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman and controlling shareholder
it evident n we entering a more competitive era he says
<unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> defense contractor that earned n million on revenue of n million in <unk> provides a more dramatic example of cost - cutting

in yesterday report <unk> <unk> said <unk> its bank in <unk> also reported a loss of n million for the quarter
but it said that its consumer banks in <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> performed well during the quarter and that nonperforming assets at these banks declined by <unk> over the year - ago period
private - sector union contracts signed in the third quarter granted slightly lower wage increases than those signed in the second quarter but wage increases still are running above last year levels
the <unk> <unk> said <unk> wage settlements in the third quarter called for average annual wage increases of <unk> in the first year and n over the life of the contracts
the last time n parties to these settlements negotiated wage increases mostly in <unk> or <unk> wages increased an average of <unk> a year over the life of the contracts
if this pattern continues the <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> will be the first year that the measure has shown an increase since <unk> when the department started comparing expiring contracts with those that replaced them
this reflects the restoration of wage cuts in the steel and other industries as well as higher wages granted nurses who work in health - care facilities
settlements reached in the first nine months of <unk> called for wage increases averaging n in the first contract year and <unk> annually over the life of the contracts the department said n
for all of <unk> union contracts provided for n wage increases in the first year and n over the life of the contracts
in the second quarter contracts called for increases of <unk> in the first year and n over the life of the contracts
the figures exclude lump - sum payments and cost - of-living adjustments so the actual wage increases may have been bigger
about <unk> of the workers covered by contracts signed in the first nine months of year get lump - sum payments about n are covered by cost - of-living clauses
unions covered by one or other provisions generally settled for lower percentage wage increases
the <unk> <unk> said <unk> wage increases in manufacturing industries continue to be smaller than those in other industries

<unk> which started in <unk> as a hybrid of the <unk> program <unk> <unk> has developed into a distinctly philippine effort
radio programs and books have followed the daily television show
in the process <unk> an archaic filipino word meaning strong or enduring has become a powerful advocate of the use of the <unk> language
it impresses on ordinary young filipinos that there nothing n to feel inferior about in using their own language says <unk> <unk> a sociologist and host of a popular television talk show
when we started the program six years ago the use of <unk> was deemed unwise by the predominantly middle class says <unk> <unk> the program creator
now she says n it no longer an issue
the success of <unk> stands in marked contrast to many academic and government attempts to promote <unk> as a national language
<unk> once known as <unk> is predominantly <unk> the <unk> - based language spoken in a part of the country principal island of <unk>
resistance to a national language comes primarily from members of the country elite who generally prefer <unk>
but while better - off filipinos are quick to cite the logic in using a language as widespread as <unk> they are often slow to reveal that they are prejudiced against <unk> say <unk> advocates of the native language
for the middle and upper - middle class <unk> is declasse says <unk> <unk> a philippine - studies professor at <unk> <unk> <unk> of the philippines
there also resentment
other opponents of <unk> come from non - <unk> regions
they argue that their own languages should have equal weight although recent surveys indicate that the majority of the country population understands <unk> more than any other language
there are seven major languages and more than <unk> dialects in the country
what tongue to speak is an emotional mine field in the philippines
it is entrenched in the country colonial bonds to the <unk> in <unk> class structure in the regional loyalties of its people and in its island geography
as they did when the <unk> was a colony of the <unk> teachers for the most part teach in <unk> even though it is a foreign language for most philippine children
as a result they often speak one language at home another at school
<unk> <unk> calls the modern - day cultural ambivalence to <unk> a language schizophrenia
the issue has been simmering for years
it does n't take much to provoke an intense debate
when <unk> <unk> <unk> whose command of <unk> is spotty announced last year that the language would be used in official communications there was an uproar from many legislators who continue to conduct debates mostly in <unk>
but many proponents of <unk> see resistance to the language finally crumbling
they believe the media including <unk> have played a crucial role
according to chief scriptwriter <unk> <unk> <unk> does n't set out to advance the cause of <unk>
it not as if we teaching language per se he says we just using it

but advertising revenue is inadequate
periodically there are threats that the program will fold
<unk> lacks the polish of <unk> <unk>

acting sometimes falls flat
there are only two large puppets in the program <unk> <unk> and a monkey named <unk> <unk>
but the production is the equal of any local program

the program is n't afraid to tackle controversial topics such as nuclear weapons and the environment

<unk> <unk> said n it plans to put other <unk> units on the block in the future with the goal of raising <unk> billion in net proceeds
<unk> <unk> rescued <unk> from the takeover bid of <unk> <unk> <unk> last <unk> by agreeing to acquire the maker of door locks and gardening tools for about n billion
the move significantly expanded <unk> <unk> product line but also significantly increased its debt load
the acquisition boosted <unk> <unk> ratio of debt to total capital to more than <unk>
company officials have said n they plan to reduce that ratio to less than <unk> over the next <unk> <unk> years
earlier this year <unk> <unk> put three <unk> businesses on the auction block the information and electronics segment the <unk> electrical assembly business and <unk> <unk>
the three units had combined n sales of about n million
the three units contributed about a third of <unk> total sales
in addition <unk> <unk> had said <unk> it would sell two other undisclosed <unk> operations if it received the right price
<unk> is one of the previously unnamed units and the first of the five n to be sold
the company is still negotiating the sales of the other four units and expects to announce agreements by the end of the year
the five units generated sales of about <unk> billion in <unk> almost half of <unk> <unk> billion revenue
<unk> posted n sales of n million
our divestiture program is on schedule and we remain confident that we will achieve our stated goal of over <unk> billion in net proceeds said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> president and chief executive officer in a statement

embedded in the budget being concocted by the <unk> - <unk> conference committee is something that looks smells and waddles like a duck
it a nuisance tax on mergers
<unk> has decided to raise n million by charging companies <unk> for the honor of filing the required papers under the <unk> - scott-rodino law
ever since the bad days of big is bad antitrust enforcement this law has required that anyone proposing a merger must make a filing describing the effects on all relevant markets
the <unk> - <unk> filing is then reviewed and any antitrust concerns usually met
typically <unk> - <unk> is used now to give managers of target firms early news of a bid and a chance to use regulatory review as a delaying tactic
the n tax would be a small cost in a multibillion - dollar deal but a serious drag on thousands of small friendly deals
one especially dangerous aspect to the new tax would be that the proceeds will be used to increase the budgets of the antitrust division at <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
this amounts to a bounty for regulators the more regulating the more they get to keep
also as former <unk> antitrust chief <unk> <unk> has noted n this would establish the precedent that the government may charge parties for the privilege of being sued regardless of whether the government prevails
yet another opportunity for <unk> <unk> to respond read my lips
line - item veto
<unk> <unk> <unk> years old was named vice chairman for planning marketing and industry services a new post
<unk> <unk> had been a vice chairman of <unk> <unk> an accounting firm that merged with rival <unk> <unk> in <unk> to form <unk> <unk> a major accounting tax and management consulting firm
<unk> <unk> appointment formalizes a role n he has been performing since the merger a spokeswoman said n
<unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> his board unanimously rejected as too low the n billion bid by <unk> . <unk> de <unk> to bring its stake in <unk> <unk> to <unk>
at a news conference <unk> <unk> accused <unk> of planning to pay for the takeover by selling parts of the company whose interests include insurance banking tuna canning sugar and orange juice
the chairman said <unk> his board members including representatives of west german insurance giant <unk> <unk> and french banks <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> hold nearly n of <unk> <unk> capital
<unk> <unk> said that as <unk> <unk> chairman he is prohibited by takeover regulations from organizing his own defense or doing anything besides managing current company business
but sources said <unk> he will be urging his allies to boost their stakes in <unk> <unk> which is being traded in <unk> and is to resume trading in <unk> <unk>
at the same time he is expected to seek legal and regulatory means of blocking or delaying <unk> bid
for the moment the sources said <unk> he has decided against seeking a white knight or organizing a counterbid for <unk>
<unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> unconsolidated or parent - company profit is likely to be n billion francs n million up from n million francs last year
that is due mostly to payments from <unk> for most of the <unk> stake <unk> it has agreed to acquire in <unk> <unk> insurance business
<unk> <unk> said <unk> the exceptional gain would mean nearly twice as high a dividend this year as last
if holders avoid tendering to <unk> he added n they can expect strong dividends again next year
analysts noted that over the past <unk> years <unk> <unk> has built his company through astute stock - market activity and has warded off at least three takeover attempts
this time however some analysts think n he could face a real battle
without some unexpected coup de theatre i do n't see what will block the <unk> bid said <unk> <unk> <unk> analyst at the brokerage <unk> - <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> biggest hope was to somehow persuade regulatory authorities to block the bid
<unk> still needs the go - ahead from the <unk> <unk> <unk> de <unk> a government regulatory agency but analysts said <unk> that is considered likely
<unk> <unk> also noted that <unk> <unk> joined <unk> core of shareholders when <unk> was denationalized in <unk> and said n it now holds just under <unk> of <unk> shares
once he realized that <unk> intentions were n't friendly he said n but before the bid was launched he sought approval to boost his <unk> stake above n
the petition is still pending but <unk> <unk> downplayed the likelihood of his organizing a takeover bid of his own for the much - larger <unk>
one big question now is the likely role of <unk> <unk> allies
<unk> <unk> said <unk> the large institutions that hold nearly n of <unk> <unk> capital all strongly support him but some analysts said <unk> they are n't so sure
<unk> for example has said in official comments so far that it will remain neutral
<unk> is <unk> lead french bank
<unk> said <unk> that it intends to bid to boost its stake in <unk> <unk> to <unk> from the <unk> <unk> it already owns
the purchase of the additional <unk> stake is expected to cost more than n billion francs n billion
<unk> says n it will offer <unk> francs n each for <unk> <unk> shares that enjoy full dividend rights and n francs each for a block of shares issued <unk> <unk> which will receive only partial dividends this year
alternatively it is to offer three <unk> shares for one <unk> <unk> share
the <unk> offer values <unk> <unk> at about n billion francs depending on how many of <unk> <unk> warrants are converted into shares during the takeover battle
<unk> <unk> <unk> said n it raised n million from an offering of liquid yield option notes
the gross proceeds from the sale of the notes which will be due on <unk> n <unk> will be used to reduce existing debt and for general corporate purposes the company said n
the debt reduction is expected to save the <unk> <unk> <unk> home video concern about n million a year in interest expense
the zero - coupon subordinated notes have no periodic interest payments
each note is being offered at n per n principal amount at maturity representing an n yield to maturity
in addition each note can be converted into <unk> <unk> common stock at a rate of n shares per note
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is the sole underwriter for the offering
the notes will have a principal amount of n million at maturity

the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has nearly eliminated the number of large profitable corporations that do n't pay federal income tax according to <unk> for <unk> <unk> a nonprofit labor - funded research and lobbying group
in a study of <unk> of the nation richest companies the group found that only seven managed to avoid paying federal income taxes last year compared with n in <unk> the last year n the old tax rules were in effect and n in n when some of the new tax provisions went into effect
moreover n companies that paid no federal income tax from <unk> through n despite billions of dollars of profits ended up paying an average of <unk> of their income in federal taxes in <unk>
the report released yesterday comes as <unk> is considering a number of special tax breaks only three years after the sweeping tax - revision legislation abolished or curtailed many loopholes
in the corporate realm the n law abolished the investment - tax credit scaled back use of an accounting method that allowed large contractors to defer taxes until a project was completed and strengthened the so - called alternative minimum tax a levy n to ensure n all money - making businesses pay some federal tax
the combination of lower rates and fewer loopholes has meant that the so - called average effective tax rate the rate actually paid of the n corporations surveyed reached n in <unk> compared with n in the years from <unk> through <unk> according to the study
in addition corporations are now shouldering a bigger share of the tax burden as the authors of the <unk> law hoped
corporate taxes paid for almost n of federal spending in <unk> excluding <unk> <unk> compared with less than n in the first half of the <unk> the study found
tax reform is working the study said
under the new tax - reform law the days of widespread wholesale corporate tax avoidance have come to an end
still <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> did n't pay any federal income tax last year although they garnered a total of n billion in profits the group said
in fact six of those companies received refunds which totaled n million
the lobbying group used publicly available information to calculate each company domestic profits and its federal income tax payments
this is the fifth year n citizens for <unk> <unk> has released a study on corporate tax bills
earlier reports which revealed that as many as n companies were avoiding income tax legally have been credited with helping galvanize efforts to overhaul the tax code
but even though companies are paying more taxes many are still paying less than the statutory rate the report said <unk>
and n companies paid effective tax rates of below <unk> of their income
while the overall picture is very encouraging significant corporate tax avoidance continues the study said

still the combined profit of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> motors <unk> fell <unk> to n billion from n billion a year earlier excluding a one - time gain of n million at <unk> from the sale of <unk> motors <unk> stock
the last time n all three companies reported north american automotive losses was in the recession year of <unk>

the market pessimism reflects the gloomy outlook in <unk>
as japanese auto makers gained market share the <unk> <unk> with <unk> in the lead slashed north american production and launched a retail discounting blitz
the price war peaked in the third quarter as big three factory discounts climbed to more than <unk> a vehicle according to industry officials
<unk> probably had the heaviest incentives said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> chief financial officer
we all did what we had to do to stay within sight of them
but the costly efforts did little to slow japanese market gains and domestic car sales have plunged <unk> since the <unk> <unk> ended many of their programs <unk> n
<unk> <unk> and <unk> have already cut fourth - quarter <unk> output plans an estimated n from <unk> levels
if sales do n't pick up the cuts will go deeper and incentives will sprout again
<unk> which has long boasted of its ability to weather a downturn saw earnings take a beating
the no . n auto maker blamed incentive costs and reduced production both the result of a substantially weaker <unk> market for a <unk> drop in net to n million or <unk> a share on revenue of <unk> billion
nearly all the decline came in <unk> <unk> automotive operations
the <unk> <unk> auto maker ran a loss of n million on assembling and marketing cars in the <unk> a deterioration of n million in that line from the <unk> quarter
<unk> managed to show a profit for the quarter primarily because of earnings from overseas auto operations and financial services
a year earlier <unk> reported record net of n million or <unk> a share on revenue of <unk> billion
in the latest nine months <unk> earned <unk> billion or <unk> a share compared with n billion or <unk> a share
the <unk> automotive loss was a sharp reversal for a company that had reeled off n consecutive quarters of improved earnings until the n second quarter
but <unk> <unk> <unk> vice president finance insisted that cost - cutting and tight production capacity will make results better in this downturn than in prior downturns when <unk> had net losses
still <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> expects the <unk> economy to weaken through the end of <unk> causing weaker sales and production
as a result fourth - quarter profit will come in below <unk> results although the drop wo n't be as sharp as the <unk> third - quarter decline he said n
part of the drop will come from an anticipated charge of as much as n million from the proposed sale of its <unk> <unk> unit
in the <unk> fourth quarter <unk> had net of <unk> billion or <unk> a share
<unk> operating profit fell to a scant n million or n cents a share its lowest quarterly total in seven years
its n million or <unk> a share gain from the sale of <unk> million <unk> shares made net n million or <unk> a share
sales were flat at <unk> billion
the results include record quarterly earnings of n million from <unk> <unk> <unk>
a year earlier <unk> net was n million or n cents a share
<unk> <unk> said <unk> costs of incentives caused a moderate loss in the <unk> <unk> <unk> company <unk> american car and truck business
he said <unk> the loss was n't that much different from <unk> <unk> million loss on <unk> automotive operations but he declined to be specific
<unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> spent an average of <unk> a vehicle on its incentive programs in the third quarter compared with about <unk> a vehicle a year earlier a high - water mark at the time
he said <unk> <unk> is no longer sure of its forecast for industry car and truck sales of n million in the n model year
consumers he said n are balking at higher prices on n cars especially after seeing the incentive - reduced prices on n models
in the nine months net was <unk> billion or <unk> a share including the gain from the <unk> stock sale compared with n million or <unk> a share after a charge of n million or n cents a share for plant closings in the n period
sales rose <unk> to n billion from n billion
heavy losses in <unk> american auto operations sent <unk> net tumbling to n million from a record n million
<unk> - based <unk> does n't issue separate quarterly earnings for the north american automotive business
but analysts estimated that <unk> had a loss of as much as n million on domestic vehicle operations
an n drop in <unk> american factory sales of cars and trucks cut into revenue and rebates to dealers and customers more than offset gains from price increases on <unk> model vehicles delivered during the period a <unk> spokesman said n
but <unk> results also illustrate the increasing diversity of its operations
in one breakdown <unk> attributed half of its net to its two big technology units <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> electronics <unk>
meanwhile <unk> said <unk> overseas auto operations are on track n to exceed last year record full - year net of <unk> billion
the diversified operations helped <unk> build its cash reserves exclusive of its financial subsidiary to <unk> billion as of <unk> n a n increase from a year earlier
this cushion could come in handy if <unk> has to trim fourth - quarter <unk> american production schedules more than the already scheduled <unk>
under the circumstances it wo n't be easy for <unk> to exceed its record <unk> fourth - quarter net of <unk> billion the spokesman acknowledged n
that means n it unlikely n the company will surpass last year n billion full - year profit even though net for the first nine months was up <unk> to n billion on revenue of <unk> billion
it earned n billion on revenue of <unk> billion in the n nine months
there are two versions of measure for measure on stage at the <unk> <unk> here
one is a strong vigorous portrayal of <unk> play the other is director <unk> <unk> overlay of present - day punk rock decadence on old <unk>
measure for measure is one of <unk> problem plays so named because it does not fit neatly into a category such as tragedy comedy or history
its ambiguity and uneasy mixture of the serious and the comic is no doubt one reason why it is very much in vogue with directors just now
last season <unk> <unk> director <unk> <unk> mounted a production at <unk> <unk> and currently two other productions one just closed at the <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> and another now at the <unk> <unk> overlap with <unk> <unk>
in the play the <unk> of <unk> despairs over the licentiousness of his subjects and turns over the rule of the city to the puritanical <unk> hoping n he can set things right
when <unk> hears that the young man <unk> has made his fiancee pregnant before he could marry her <unk> summarily condemns <unk> to death
when however <unk> sister <unk> a novitiate in a convent goes to <unk> to plead her brother case the obdurate ruler immediately falls in love with her and in a supreme act of hypocrisy demands that <unk> yield up her virtue to him in exchange for her brother life
meanwhile the <unk> who set the original scheme in motion appears on the scene disguised as a friar and becomes involved in a series of intrigues that has everyone fearing the worst possible outcome until the <unk> arranges a last minute reprieve for all concerned
for the <unk> production scene designer <unk> <unk> <unk> has arranged a stark but extremely effective set featuring a rectangular platform of white - washed boards that extends into the audience
when the action requires a prison cell consisting of an enlarged wire cage rolls forward on iron wheels on the platform
in the play major scenes <unk> <unk> demonstrates that he has a firm grasp of the shakespearean dynamic
when <unk> <unk> <unk> confronts her brother <unk> <unk> <unk> in his cell explaining the price n she has been asked to secure his freedom when <unk> and the disguised <unk> <unk> <unk> conspire to trick <unk> and when <unk> <unk> <unk> a woman wronged by <unk> confronts him with his past misdeeds the performers bring the dramatic high points to life with intense energy and intelligence
at such moments <unk> <unk> makes it clear that he has the capacity n to be a superior interpreter of <unk>
when however he decides to be modern or more accurately when he decides to be trendy the results are far less satisfactory
<unk> <unk> is of the directorial school that believes n one must find modern parallels or metaphors to make shakespeare accessible to today audiences
it a valid approach but it puts a heavy burden on the director to show an uncommon degree of imagination and taste
in his <unk> <unk> <unk> has modernized the pimps and prostitutes of <unk> whom <unk> is supposed to bring under control by converting them into transvestites punk rockers and heavy metal types with a strong emphasis on leather chains and porno - inspired costumes
loud rock music accompanies all the scene changes even those in the convent
when <unk> is arrested he is brought on stage nude except for the manacles on his wrists and ankles
when the opportunist <unk> <unk> <unk> visits the convent to inform <unk> of her brother fate <unk> not only slaps the mother superior on her rear but brings along a voluptuous companion <unk> <unk> not in <unk> script n to undulate lasciviously
meanwhile the pimp <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> dressed in black leather and a prominent codpiece indulges in enough obscene gestures and pelvic thrusts <unk> to launch a space probe
the problem here is not in the concept but in its lack of discrimination
the inclusion at one point for example of a list of glitzy modern - day malefactors ranging from <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> is a bid for a cheap laugh unworthy of <unk> <unk> ability
despite the excesses however the scorecard for the production has many more pluses than minuses
what more it represents an important step for the <unk> <unk>
measure for measure is <unk> <unk> first directorial assignment as the theater new artistic director
he succeeded <unk> <unk> who was fired by the <unk> board n months ago
her dismissal angered many in the regional theater establishment and led <unk> <unk> head of <unk> <unk> <unk> to write an editorial in <unk> <unk> magazine condemning the board
none of this backlash could change the fact that <unk> <unk> regime was remarkably undistinguished and unimaginative
now the <unk> has moved ahead on both artistic and financial fronts
not only is <unk> <unk> giving the theater a new sense of adventure and excitement on stage the balance sheet is the best n the theater has had in n years
as opposed to the n million deficit of the <unk> season the <unk> year concluded with a n surplus and a <unk> cash reserve
admittedly last season runaway hit <unk> <unk> helped a lot but so did cost cutting and other measures insisted on by the board
only time will tell if <unk> <unk> can restore to the <unk> the acclaim n it received when its founder <unk> <unk> was at the height of her powers
but it is clear n he is going to give it a shot
democratic leaders have bottled up <unk> <unk> capital - gains tax cut in the <unk> and may be able to prevent a vote on the issue indefinitely
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said n he intends to use <unk> procedures to force advocates of the tax cut to come up with at least n votes before they can address the issue
and neither democrats nor republicans are predicting that the capital - gains forces can produce enough votes
the n requirement will be there and they do n't have the n votes <unk> <unk> said
they do n't have the votes n to get it passed
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the leading republican proponent of the tax cut did n't disagree
i not sure what going to happen he said
previously he had said <unk> he would be able to find the requisite <unk> votes eventually
<unk> <unk> has offered his capital - gains-cut package as an amendment to a bill now pending in the <unk> that would authorize aid to <unk> and <unk>
democrats are holding up a vote on the amendment by threatening a filibuster or extended debate
for a cloture vote to stop the filibuster republicans must muster at least n votes
yesterday <unk> <unk> acknowledged we do n't have the votes for cloture today
the republicans show no sign of relenting
<unk> leaders continued to press for a vote on the amendment to the <unk> <unk> aid measure
and they threatened to try to amend any other revenue bill in the <unk> with the capital - gains provision
this is serious business we serious about a capital - gains reduction said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> leader
the strategy is let vote
the republicans contend that they can garner a majority in the n <unk> for a capital - gains tax cut
they accuse the democrats of unfairly using <unk> rules to erect a n hurdle
democrats counter that the republicans have often used the same rules to suit their own ends
the two sides also traded accusations about the cost of the <unk> plan
democrats asserted that the proposal which also would create a new type of individual retirement account was fraught with budget gimmickry that would lose billions of dollars in the long run
republicans countered that long - range revenue estimates were unreliable
the <unk> proposal would reduce the tax depending on how long an asset was held
it also would create a new <unk> that would shield from taxation the appreciation on investments made for a wide variety of purposes including retirement medical expenses first - home purchases and tuition
a <unk> <unk> spokesman said n <unk> <unk> is generally supportive of the <unk> plan
<unk> <unk> <unk> . said <unk> it agreed to acquire the rest of <unk> <unk> a leading west german insurance brokerage firm in which it has held a <unk> stake for n years
the transaction for cash and stock would represent the biggest european takeover since <unk> for <unk> <unk> - based <unk> <unk> the world largest insurance broker
it also the first major sign of the long - awaited consolidation in the european insurance industry as the <unk> <unk> <unk> moves toward a single market by <unk>
protective barriers will start coming down within the insurance industry next summer when big industrial companies will be able to buy insurance from carriers in any other <unk> country for the first time
that why we have been working hard to develop a single more unified presence in <unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> president at a <unk> news conference yesterday
analysts speculated that <unk> <unk> would spend between n million marks n million and n million marks for the rest of <unk> <unk> or roughly <unk> to n times the private firm estimated earnings
this is paying a big price to maintain their virility as the world leading insurance broker said <unk> <unk> an analyst at <unk> <unk> a <unk> brokerage firm
earlier this year <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> agreed to acquire <unk> <unk> <unk> a first step toward establishing a presence in the european market ahead of n
but most <unk> insurers have n't rushed to change the way n they do business in <unk> because they believe n the european market will still be dominated by a handful of domestic companies
under the proposed combination <unk> <unk> would gain a majority stake in <unk> <unk> that would increase over time to the rest of the remaining n
the three managing general partners would receive a significant number of <unk> <unk> shares said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a partner who would also join <unk> <unk> board
<unk> <unk> said n he sought the combination because all our large clients in <unk> are becoming european companies or multinational companies and they expect an insurance broker to serve them as well in <unk> as in <unk>

the expected canadian move has been welcomed by the <unk> administration even though <unk> has opposed such <unk> actions as the trade embargo against <unk> the invasion of <unk> and the military support for <unk> <unk> guerrillas
latin american countries have long urged <unk> to join the <unk> in the hopes that it would be a counterweight to the <unk> which for many years tended to dominate the n organization
even though the <unk> also has supported canadian membership it has n't been a <unk> priority
the fact that we might not side with the americans may be a reason why <unk> membership in the <unk> has n't been over the years an item high on the <unk> agenda said <unk> <unk> former canadian ambassador to the <unk>
the canadian application is expected to be announced in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by canadian <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who is attending a centenary celebration of costa rican democracy
<unk> has a larger and more beneficial role n to play in the hemisphere <unk> <unk> said recently
some canadian political commentators have opposed <unk> joining what they see as a u.s.-dominated organization
<unk> could do plenty of things to get serious about <unk> <unk> without running the risk of getting caught in the cross fire between the <unk> and latin american members of the <unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> a columnist in <unk> <unk> <unk> newspaper

<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> n editorial - page article bemoaning violence in comedy movies <unk> you slay me is interesting but somewhat off - base
as a fan of older movies from the n on i do not find <unk> modern comedies contain violence sex and foul language to any greater degree than other recent movies
older movies have plenty of violence though it is portrayed in keeping with the more restrictive social conventions of the time
for example one of my favorite movies is the n british comedy <unk> hearts and coronets in which the entire comedy is based on actor <unk> <unk> murdering eight titled relatives all played by <unk> <unk> because they snubbed his mother and stand in the way of his acquiring the family title
similarly one of the most popular comedy genres of the <unk> and <unk> was the murder mystery\/comedy
the <unk> <unk> series of movies as well as many others based their entire comedic appeal on the star detectives witty quips and puns as other characters in the movies were murdered
further i think <unk> <unk> <unk> made a poor choice in picking a fish called <unk> as an example of the deplorable state of modern comedy movies
the specific scene n he mentions in which pet dogs are crushed is somewhat reminiscent of the continual plights that befall the coyote in the old <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> cartoons
there is no slow - motion close - up blood - and-guts portrayal of the animal demise
keep in mind that this is the same movie in which a character is flattened by a steamroller only to pop right back up and peer in the window of a <unk> <unk> from the outside as it takes off
i will be the first n to agree that there is much n to be found wrong with modern movie making
many modern scriptwriters seem to be incapable of writing drama or anything else without foul - mouthed cursing
sex and violence are routinely included even when they are irrelevant to the script and high - tech special effects are continually substituted for good plot and character development
in short we have a movie and television industry that is either incapable or petrified of making a movie unless it carries a n or r rating
hence copious amounts of gratuitous sex violence and gutter language are included as a crutch
however these faults are not the exclusive property of modern comedies and i believe <unk> <unk> <unk> errs when he attempts to link this modern phenomenon too closely to a single category of movie making

western european leaders who favor speedy economic and monetary union are adding a new argument to their arsenal the dizzying political changes under way in <unk> <unk>
french <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> spanish <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and others have begun linking the rapid changes in the <unk> to the need to speed up changes in the <unk>
they are stressing that the best way n for the <unk> to help the <unk> is to move faster towards western european economic and monetary unity
this would make the market - oriented system more attractive to eastern countries they argue <unk> and allow greater economic aid and technological know - how to flow from <unk> to <unk>
the only response to the challenge being presented to us by the <unk> <unk> <unk> told the <unk> <unk> in <unk> yesterday is to reinforce and accelerate the union and cohesion of the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> proposed that a conference be convened next fall to write a new treaty for the <unk> allowing a european central bank and that the treaty be ratified by <unk>
<unk> <unk> also proposed a separate <unk> for <unk> that would channel development money to the <unk>
one basis for linking change in the <unk> and change in the <unk> is the notion that integrating n million eastern europeans with n million western europeans is primarily the task of europeans despite the <unk> obvious strategic and economic interest
says a european strategist the <unk> tends to look at <unk> <unk> not including the <unk> <unk> as <unk> looks at <unk> <unk> important but far away
but for us in <unk> <unk> these are europeans next door
a reintegrated <unk> implies big changes in n military and economic policies
there is likely to be a natural division of labor says <unk> <unk> <unk> director of the <unk> <unk> for <unk> studies in <unk> with the <unk> more engaged in strategic issues with the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> more involved with specific aid measures for the <unk>
the designation at <unk> economic summit of major industrialized nations of the <unk> <unk> as coordinator of western aid to <unk> and <unk> was a first step
in part this division is dictated by economics <unk> <unk> is a net exporter of capital while the <unk> is n't
while american aid efforts have been limited by budget problems yesterday <unk> announced a three - year four billion french franc n million aid plan for <unk>
despite sudden changes in the strategic equation some western european leaders especially british <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> remain skeptical about european political and economic unity and are unlikely to let <unk> - <unk> concerns change their minds
but british analysts are beginning to link the issues
we need a western <unk> says <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> affairs in <unk> referring to <unk> <unk> longstanding policy of a diplomatic opening to the <unk>
for <unk> and <unk> we need to think about a stick - and-carrot economic approach that would force them to price things realistically in return for removing all our tariff barriers
he notes that the <unk> <unk> of <unk> aid to <unk> did n't just throw money at post - war <unk> it also liberalized and opened up those markets
the french analysis goes further
most of the <unk> leaders have finally concluded that we all want perestroika soviet leader <unk> <unk> policy of economic restructuring to succeed says <unk> <unk> security adviser to <unk> <unk>
but they have n't yet drawn the operational policy conclusions
he adds that with communism collapsing and <unk> <unk> scrambling to rejuvenate the soviet economy our interest lies in a controlled transformation a contained nuclear reaction so we need to help him and not just with words
managing change he adds <unk> will require a lot more aid and a prominent role for the <unk> especially in dealing with the question of german reunification
<unk> <unk> <unk> director of the french <unk> for <unk> relations in <unk> says n it is n't clear what exactly <unk> <unk> wants
any push for a <unk> vision of a common european home implying the eventual dissolution of the <unk> a soviet - german partnership and the withdrawal of <unk> forces would be a very very serious problem he says n
he doubts n a bismarckian super state will emerge that would dominate <unk> but warns of a risk of profound change in the heart of the <unk> <unk> from a <unk> that is too strong even if democratic
he adds we and the rest of the <unk> have to talk to the germans now frankly and raise these future risks with them
while many commentators particularly french ones worry that hasty and emotional reaction to the changes in the <unk> might lead to dangerous pressures for a denuclearized <unk> or the speeded - up withdrawal of american troops <unk> <unk> in <unk> sees a more positive scenario
there seems to be a message from <unk> n there a deal on offer he says
they want reassurance n we wo n't try to undermine or destroy the <unk> <unk>
in return the <unk> and <unk> could keep their nuclear weapons
he adds once both sides feel comfortable it should be that much easier to make more progress toward the economic and social reforms that are now starting in the <unk>

one of those new computers called <unk> <unk> accounted for nearly half of the <unk> systems <unk> <unk> shipped in the quarter he said n
more than two - thirds of the systems shipped meanwhile were products introduced in <unk>
but problems in manufacturing forecasting demand and getting the bugs out of a new management information system made it extremely difficult for <unk> to meet demand for its newest computers well into the summer

two old friends <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> are trying to limit further damage to u.s.-china ties
but as <unk> prepares a fresh package of sanctions against <unk> the already - tense relationship could get worse
the problem for <unk> will be to weigh what <unk> is saying to its people against the more conciliatory message n it is delivering to the <unk> administration
in a move apparently aimed at heading off new punitive legislation <unk> <unk> sent an indirect signal to <unk> via <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> physicist who met <unk> <unk> and other chinese leaders in <unk> last month
when he met with <unk> <unk> on his return <unk> <unk> says <unk> he told the president that the chinese made statements to me that i regard as a first step toward reconciliation
the communication <unk> <unk> <unk> brought represents the softer line <unk> the <unk> has been hoping to hear from chinese officials since the <unk> <unk> massacre of pro - democracy demonstrators in <unk>
the chinese leader <unk> <unk> informed <unk> <unk> <unk> expressed some regret for what had happened in <unk> and conceded that <unk> officials bore some responsibility
<unk> <unk> says <unk> <unk> <unk> told him we should not mind those who participated in demonstrations signed anti - government materials and went on hunger strikes
<unk> <unk> added says <unk> <unk> <unk> that we really made mistakes
we must not shirk our responsibility and we can not just blame the demonstrators
<unk> <unk> also reported to the president that in a separate meeting <unk> <unk> chief <unk> <unk> said <unk> the chinese leadership looked kindly on the students who took part in the demonstrations
<unk> <unk> also pledged that the <unk> <unk> <unk> would publish very soon a list of those killed
and he told the physicist that <unk> leaders were very much concerned about the deaths and had arranged aid for the victims families
i transmitted my conversations to the <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> says
but he adds i was not acting as a messenger
he says that the chinese never asked him to convey their statements to <unk> <unk> but that the <unk> <unk> spontaneously invited him to do so
<unk> <unk> concedes n the statements made to him are far different from others being issued in <unk> but attributes that to the fact that the situation in <unk> is very complex
according to <unk> sources in <unk> the administration hopes <unk> <unk> <unk> fairly conciliatory comments will prod <unk> to be cautious about further sanctions against <unk>
the president does n't want to have legislative sanctions says a <unk> official
but he may not have a choice
given <unk> far - from-conciliatory statements to its own people <unk> <unk> may be unable to prevent new sanctions
<unk> officials have said n they will step up the campaign of arrests and intimidation against those who participated in the demonstrations
sentences have been stiff
a university student got eight years for participating in the rallies sources in <unk> said n while an n worker got n years
nor has <unk> hinted to its citizens that it will publish the identities of those killed
so far the victims are officially considered evil - doers and their families receive no compensation
a man gunned down by a stray bullet while cycling to work carries after his death the official stigma of counterrevolutionary his wife says <unk>
what more much of <unk> official rhetoric is hostile to the <unk>
<unk> frequently lambastes the <unk> <unk> for harboring astrophysicist <unk> <unk> a political dissident who took refuge there after the massacre
in the <unk> there are still people who want to crush <unk> and interfere in our internal affairs <unk> <unk> <unk> new ambassador to the <unk> said as he left for <unk> last week
the <unk> and <unk> are to begin soon hashing out an agreement for sanctions legislation
it will probably be attached to a <unk> <unk> authorization bill which <unk> <unk> is n't expected to veto
a congressional staffer involved in drafting the sanctions says <unk> they are likely to mirror those <unk> <unk> <unk> enacted shortly after the massacre
but as legislative action they would carry greater weight and would be more difficult n to rescind
measures already in effect that are expected to be made law include a ban on military sales and exchanges a suspension of most high - level government contacts and a halt to <unk> trade enhancement programs such as the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
codifying those sanctions could prompt chinese retaliation
if the two sides are n't careful u.s.-china ties could spin downward out of control says a <unk> official in <unk>
<unk> and <unk> are hoping that cooler heads prevail
the amount of blood n surgical patients can donate and store before surgery can be increased by the new genetically engineered drug <unk>
<unk> or erythropoietin is a protein n the human body makes to stimulate the growth of red blood cells
a genetically engineered version of the human protein developed by <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> recently has been marketed by the <unk> <unk> division of <unk> <unk>
a competing version of <unk> is being developed by <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
the drug is being used primarily to treat anemias
a new experiment reported in this week <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> involved giving injections of <unk> <unk> to n patients who wanted to store units of their own blood
the patients began receiving <unk> injections about a month before their scheduled surgery
they then began donating blood twice a week receiving an <unk> injection each time
if tests indicated a low number of red cells blood was n't taken
the <unk> - treated patients donated an average of n units of blood each compared with only n units donated by a similar group of surgical patients who received a placebo injection
the volume of red cells donated by the <unk> - treated patients was <unk> higher per donor the research team representing a number of hospitals and blood banks reported n
during its centennial year the <unk> <unk> <unk> will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of american business history
tax shelters called <unk> <unk> accounts or iras were created without fanfare on <unk> n <unk> but grew beyond expectations as an inducement to personal saving
that <unk> <unk> in his first major act after succeeding the resigned <unk> <unk> as president <unk> <unk> <unk> signed the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
pension reform was its main thrust
labor and business leaders quoted at the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> rites hailed its provisions for insuring corporate pension benefits
iras were like stepchildren there
the <unk> conception is murky
in <unk> then <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with the key support of <unk> <unk> <unk> sought some form of pensions for the uncovered
that year a four - man group headed by <unk> <unk> in the <unk> and regulations division of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> for the <unk> <unk> <unk> was assigned the task of designing a plan
they used the <unk> <unk> <unk> a pension plan created by a <unk> <unk> congressman for the self - employed as a partial model
this team initially called its new model <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk>
but it did n't sing
so they opted for <unk> naming it after <unk> <unk> a brilliant <unk> actuary who helped them
<unk> himself confirms this account
<unk> rules have been changed over the years
one in <unk> raised to <unk> a year from <unk> the amount <unk> a person could put tax - deductible into the tax - deferred accounts and widened coverage to people under employer retirement plans
this caused an explosion of <unk> promotions by brokers banks mutual funds and others
but in <unk> <unk> sharply reduced the number of people who could qualify for its benefits and <unk> tax - deductions slowed their roaring growth
<unk> account assets have grown to about <unk> billion from <unk> billion last year and just n billion in <unk>
the <unk> <unk> <unk> announced a n devaluation of the ruble against the dollar for private transactions in an apparent attempt to curb the nation rapidly growing black market for hard currency
the measure which will take effect next <unk> will create a two - tier exchange rate
commercial transactions will continue to be based on the official rate of about <unk> rubles to the dollar
but for soviet citizens who travel abroad for business or tourism the rate will jump to <unk> rubles to the dollar
<unk> news agency said <unk> the devaluation also will apply to foreigners transactions
but it did n't elaborate and it remains unclear how far western tourists and foreigners living in <unk> will be allowed to benefit from the sweeping rate cut
the current ruble rate has long been out of line with the black market
as soviet leader <unk> <unk> has opened up the country to foreign trade the discrepancy has become ever greater
western tourists in the <unk> <unk> who could exchange a dollar albeit illegally for about four rubles a year ago are now being offered n rubles or more
even at such rates black marketeers have been able to make big profits because of the dire shortage of consumer goods here
they use dollars to buy western items such as video recorders and personal computers and then sell them at a huge mark - up
the going rate for a small personal computer that costs about n in the <unk> is anywhere from <unk> to <unk> rubles
even a pack of <unk> <unk> cigarettes can fetch <unk> rubles or more
with more than n billion rubles in savings accounts and little n to spend them on soviet consumers grumble at the exorbitant black - market prices for such goods but they buy them anyway
<unk> has already tacitly admitted that the ruble is n't worth much announcing in <unk> that it will pay soviet farmers in hard currency for grain and other produce that they grow in excess of state - plan quotas
the absurdity of the official rate should seem obvious to everyone the afternoon newspaper <unk> wrote in a brief commentary on the devaluation
the <unk> <unk> move is part of a drive to iron out exchange - rate discrepancies as <unk> moves toward making the ruble convertible a goal that soviet bankers and economists say <unk> is still far away
rumors of an impending devaluation have been circulating in <unk> for weeks but the size of the cut took many western bankers by surprise
it much bigger than we expected said one german banker who asked not to be named
the next step which could have a larger effect on businesses will come early next month when the <unk> for <unk> <unk> affairs is to hold its first auction of foreign currency
soviet companies needing western currencies to buy equipment and supplies abroad will be able to submit bids
plans for the auction which was supposed to take place last spring and become a regular event have been thwarted by a lack of hard currency
soviet firms that hold some are unwilling to part with it and joint ventures are n't yet allowed to participate
the <unk> also has been unwilling to provide hard currency for the auction using a lot of it instead to finance emergency imports of consumer goods
if foreign tourists and businesses could sell their currencies freely at the new better exchange rate that would enable the <unk> <unk> to increase its dollar reserves and would mop up some of the excess rubles in the economy at the same time
but the amounts n they exchange may be limited most soviet hotels for example demand payment in hard currency from western visitors
unless other rules are changed the devaluation could cause difficulties for the people n it is primarily meant to help soviets who travel abroad
over the past three years thousands of people here have made use of looser travel restrictions to get their first taste of life abroad
but under current rules they are allowed to change just n rubles into dollars and other currencies for each trip
at the new rate that would give them about <unk> <unk> to travel on
it is n't yet clear whether the <unk> limit will be lifted
if it is n't the black market for dollars probably will continue to thrive
<unk> <unk> machines <unk> made news this summer when it landed an unusual contract to manage all of <unk> <unk> <unk> data - processing needs
but the computer giant appears to have lost a second key contract with <unk> to archrival <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> yesterday confirmed that it has entered negotiations with <unk> <unk> <unk> to manage all of its voice and data communications needs
<unk> based in <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> also had bid for the business
<unk> is based in <unk> <unk>
the loss is a setback to <unk> which pointed to the <unk> contract as an example of its success in systems integration
that an emerging business in which computer makers or consultants provide turnkey communications and computing services to major corporations
a <unk> spokesman declined to disclose the potential value of the contract which is still in negotiation
he said that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> communications <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> itself would likely be digital subcontractors on the project
when we decided to look outside the company for critical data - processing and communications services we wanted to get the best vendor for that service said <unk> <unk> the spokesman
that why we went with <unk> for data center management and now <unk> for voice and data telecommunications
this year is the <unk> anniversary of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and some members of <unk> think n it time n to take a fresh look at the nation central bank
after n years there may be a few things that are worth reexamining
the regional <unk> <unk> <unk> setup for instance may be out of date
in earlier years it may have seemed reasonable to give <unk> <unk> a bank and allow <unk> <unk> only a branch of the <unk> <unk> bank but times have changed
maybe the whole regional system is an anachronism the <unk> after all is a national central bank
some of the would - be reformers however want to restore an arrangement n we once had or at least part of it
in the beginning the treasury secretary and the comptroller of the currency were both ex officio members of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
but in <unk> when <unk> was trying to find someone or something n to blame for the <unk> <unk> it decided to drop both the secretary and the comptroller from the board
<unk> <unk> a former treasury secretary who was then back in <unk> probably influenced the decision
he said that when he was on the board he felt that he had a great deal of power and somehow he did n't think <unk> that was a good thing
times have changed
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has introduced a bill in <unk> <unk> - sponsored by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that would put the treasury secretary back on the board
there is doubt that the change would accomplish much but at least <unk> as in <unk> would be doing something
so far no one has suggested putting the comptroller back on the board
<unk> <unk> the incumbent treasury secretary is of course aware of the proposal and he does n't like it much
<unk> <unk> has changed tactics dropping the seat - for-the-secretary idea
that may have pleased the secretary but <unk> <unk> <unk> chief economist of the investment firm of <unk> <unk> <unk> suggests that <unk> <unk> may figure n he already has all the power n he needs
like most treasury secretaries <unk> <unk> takes a keen interest in monetary matters of course
he was in fact taking an especially keen interest in board matters even before he went to the treasury
after the <unk> n market crash <unk> <unk> as a private citizen headed a presidential commission that tried to decide what went wrong and what should be done about it
one of the commission recommendations was that a single agency probably the <unk> <unk> should coordinate regulation of all financial markets
this recommendation might have encouraged a turf - hungry bureaucrat to try to expand his power but so far <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has n't made a pitch for the job
the <unk> has plenty of responsibilities in times of market turmoil and in <unk> and again in <unk> it appears to have handled them well
<unk> <unk> has said <unk> he thought n government agencies in the latest market drop were better prepared to coordinate their actions but he has left no doubt that he still likes the ideas <unk> the commission advanced nearly two years ago
in recent weeks moreover <unk> <unk> has joined other administration officials in trying to urge the <unk> toward lower interest rates
the urging admittedly has been gentle
in an interview with the <unk> <unk> in early <unk> the secretary said <unk> the <unk> may be slightly more interested in curbing inflation than the administration is while the administration may put slightly more emphasis on spurring economic growth
at least some economists of course would argue that inflation deserves a lot of emphasis
earlier this month the <unk> <unk> <unk> held a conference to assess the system first n years
<unk> <unk> a <unk> - <unk> <unk> economist noted that the <unk> record included the longest most sustained peacetime inflation in our history dating from either <unk> or <unk> to n
the inflation - growth argument is an old one but <unk> <unk> on the board or off is surely trying to influence <unk> policy
equally importantly the treasury secretary has spearheaded the administration effort to bring the <unk> dollar down by shopping avidly for west german marks and japanese yen
the treasury can do something on its own but to have any hope of success it needs help from the <unk>
the central bank has been helping but apparently not especially eagerly
the <unk> has been intervening in foreign currency markets all right but through <unk> at least it appeared to be sterilizing the intervention
in other words it was offsetting purchases of marks and yen by buying dollars in the domestic money market
now sterilized intervention may have some effect
when traders see <unk> the <unk> is in the exchange market it may make them tread a little carefully for fear of what the central bank may do
but it generally accepted that sterilized intervention has little or no lasting impact on currency values
after <unk> the <unk> may have stopped sterilizing but it hard to see much impact on the dollar
the dollar is still highly volatile
the <unk> has let interest rates slip slightly but whether the main reason was dollar intervention the gloomy reports on manufacturing employment or the <unk> <unk> market drop only <unk> <unk> and his associates know
earlier this year <unk> <unk> president of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> argued forcefully that a government that wants steady stable exchange rates might try some steady stable economic policies
trying to manage exchange rates to some desired level he said <unk> would mean diverting monetary and fiscal policies from their customary roles and thereby risking excessive inflation and unemployment and inadequate capital formation
the more we think about it the more we suspect <unk> <unk> <unk> does indeed have enough power where he already is
this has been a week of stunning events behind what was once called the <unk> <unk> and interesting shifts in official american policy toward <unk>
it has also been a week when inside - the-beltway <unk> has had a high old time gnawing over <unk> - <unk> <unk> multimillion - dollar junket in <unk>
the latter may seem oddly irrelevant if not downright trivial given the big picture and the way n we have handled it in the nation capital has done nothing to dispel that impression
in fact however <unk> <unk> casual debasement of the office n he so recently held raises issues about which americans can actually do something
our ability to influence the outcome of events in <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> is far more marginal
those events continue to move at a rate and in a direction which leave informed commentary let alone policy far in their wake
earlier this week soviet <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> confessed that the <unk> ignored universal human values by invading <unk> and to put it bluntly engaged in a violation of the <unk> <unk> by building its radar station at <unk>
<unk> is no longer a <unk> peoples republic the <unk> <unk> no longer has automatic delegates in the <unk> <unk> of peoples deputies and <unk> <unk> was not backed unanimously by his fellow party functionaries when he took over as <unk> <unk> new maximum leader
all of that is just for starters or so the hundreds of thousands of <unk> europeans in the streets seem to hope and are certainly demanding
of like though lesser note <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> put the administration four - square behind perestroika and glasnost and therefore behind <unk> <unk> in a pair of carefully reasoned speeches over the past week or so
and last but not least <unk> <unk> <unk> now views the changes in <unk> <unk> as absolutely extraordinary and believes that <unk> <unk> ca n't turn the clock back in <unk> <unk> because the change is too inexorable as he told the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
in other words after some highly visible dithering and public airing of differences the administration has come down on the side of those who believe that what we are witnessing from <unk> to <unk> is a good thing n to be welcomed rather than a new thing <unk> to be feared or viewed with suspicion
all of this is what history will note assuming that events do n't make it seem a bad joke when the record of this time is put down
for journalists however who write what they fondly view as history first draft this has also been a week n to give a lot of space and time to <unk> and <unk> sales appearance in <unk> on behalf of a communications giant and its controversial founder
it has been a well - paid transaction this bartering away of the prestige of the republic highest office
the japanese industrialist has coughed up at least n million the japanese government has put up just about as much or so it is reported and at least one estimate puts the total tab at n million
all of which has enabled those of us in <unk> who enjoy wallowing in such things to go into high public dudgeon as <unk> <unk> and i did the other night on <unk> <unk>
punching away we raised what i still think n were all the right issues and landed more than one hard blow but at the end of the affair there was just the tiniest nagging worry that we had been aiming at the wrong target
as one of his defenders so aptly put it <unk> <unk> was simply doing what he had always done before his election and some would say thereafter as well
he was performing for pay and why should anyone expect anything more
primarily because there more to the matter than <unk> <unk> personal values or lack of them
selling the presidency for a mess of pottage is not so much a devaluation from the norm of public life today as it is a reflection of the disintegration of public standards
the theme song for the <unk> has been anything goes and it has been whistled with gusto from <unk> <unk> to some of the highest peaks of televangelism
there are those who say that this is nothing new that <unk> has always suffered from a bad case of schizophrenia when it comes to the dichotomy between what is professed and what is practiced
there is evidence n to support that view
eighty - three years ago <unk> <unk> wrote to <unk> <unk> the moral flabbiness born of the exclusive worship of the bitch goddess success that with the squalid cash interpretation put on the word success is our national disease
but if it was the national disease in <unk> it is today the national commonplace
if there is no law against it do it
if the law leaves loopholes use them
if there is no moral prohibition that expressly forbids it full speed ahead
and if you are caught or if people complain simply argue that everyone does it or no one said n i should n't and brazen it out
as a last recourse when all else has failed and you are pinned apologize for having disappointed those who trusted you but deny having actually done anything wrong
see for instance <unk> <unk> remarks upon being sentenced to prison this <unk> for defrauding the faithful
consider the troubling dissonance between <unk> <unk> speech of confession this week and the hang - tough defense of everyone concerned with the <unk> - <unk> affair
the soviet foreign minister publicly concedes that his government violated norms of behavior in <unk> and just plain lied about the radar station
we have people in high place still lying through their teeth about <unk> - <unk> and that apparently is n't going to change
for that matter those long ago identified as liars are still given respectful hearings in the press
that is the key to the current national disease
no one seems willing to hold anyone in public life to a standard higher than the narrowest construction of the law
the occasional media witch hunt about some politician private peccadilloes notwithstanding the general inclination is to offer a version of the old refrain who am i to judge
thus no standards no judgment and no values
you are mad because he making so much money say <unk> <unk> defenders
no we ought to be mad because he has demeaned the office n we gave him enlisting it in the service of private gain just as we ought to be mad that public officials lie through their teeth play disingenuous games about their activities or to steal a phrase make public service a private trough
i not going to be stampeded into overreacting to any of this <unk> <unk> told <unk> <unk> in this week interview
he was referring to the absolutely extraordinary events in <unk> <unk> and it is a defensible position
but there is no defense at all for the ethos of the <unk>
we did n't stampede into it we slithered and slipped down the long slope and now we have as its quintessential symbol a former president huckstering for a foreign poohbah
or perhaps that is a fitting symbol for the <unk> <unk> of <unk> everything for sale nothing of real value
<unk> <unk> is a political commentator who heads a television production firm
<unk> <unk> <unk> directors said n the company chairman and chief executive <unk> <unk> is considering bidding n million canadian dollars <unk> n million to acquire the company
the board said <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are negotiating financing before offering c$ n a share to acquire all of <unk> shares outstanding
the directors added that the two executives have n't reached a final decision to proceed with a bid and that until an offer is made the board will continue seeking higher offers from other bidders
the directors said <unk> if <unk> <unk> and <unk> mail an offer to shareholders by <unk> n it will reimburse them a maximum of c$ n million for expenses related to a bid
we consider that his bid is an acceptable bid said <unk> <unk> spokeswoman for the independent directors committee appointed last <unk> to solicit and review bids for the company in the wake of a dispute between <unk> <unk> and <unk> major shareholder <unk> <unk>
<unk> and <unk> other major shareholder <unk> - based financier <unk> <unk> and his associates have agreed to tender their holdings to an offer by <unk> <unk> unless a higher offer is made by another bidder
<unk> holds half of <unk> equity and n of its voting rights through restricted voting shares while <unk> interests hold about n of the company equity
<unk> <unk> said <unk> the committee had received other bids
she declined to identify other bidders but said <unk> <unk> <unk> offer is all cash and it for all of the company
several <unk> analysts have speculated that outside bids received by the committee were either disappointingly low or for only part of the company
all n this has really established is that <unk> and the bronfmans have agreed on a price at which they can be bought out said <unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
if a bid materializes at that price shareholders will have every reason n to be glad but the question of financing still remains
last <unk> <unk> <unk> and a group of financial backers planned to acquire up to <unk> of <unk> for <unk> n a share from <unk> associates
<unk> <unk> who would have had the right to vote those shares for two years said n the purchase subsequently rejected by regulators was aimed at consolidating his control of the company
<unk> strongly opposed the <unk> group move
the directors did n't indicate the source of financing for <unk> <unk> new proposal but said <unk> <unk> and the <unk> associates agreed in principle to buy for n million and then lease back to <unk> its <unk> theater complex in <unk> <unk> <unk> if <unk> <unk> succeeds in an offer
this is being done at the suggestion of <unk> <unk> and to accommodate him to facilitate his financing arrangements <unk> <unk> said
in addition the directors said <unk> if a bid by <unk> <unk> is successful <unk> expects <unk> <unk> <unk> to acquire the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> unit <unk> it does n't own and provide <unk> <unk> with additional loan financing
<unk> <unk> <unk> chief executive said n the british theater chain total involvement would n't exceed n million but declined to give a breakdown between the loan financing and the proposed <unk> <unk> purchase
<unk> shareholders responded coolly to yesterday announcement
in trading on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> closed at <unk> down n cents with more than a million shares changing hands
on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> closed at c$ n off <unk> canadian cents well below the <unk> <unk> level
where the bid asked <unk> <unk> - <unk> an analyst and broker with <unk> securities dealer <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> - <unk> said <unk> he does n't think <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> are anywhere close to arranging financing and that investors will need a solid offer before the stock begins to rise again
<unk> <unk> could n't be reached for comment
two west german chemical companies announced steps that apparently are designed to boost the chemical industry standing among environmental groups and the general public
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> the company wants to have a substitute product n to completely replace ozone - damaging chlorofluorocarbons by <unk>
in <unk> <unk> the largest producer of <unk> in <unk> <unk> said n it wanted to reduce production of the product by <unk> by n
<unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> will invest n million marks n million in a plant to make a substitute product n it has developed that it says <unk> is unchlorinated
the company hopes <unk> the new plant likely to be built in <unk> will be able to produce n tons a year
this year <unk> will produce about <unk> tons of cfcs in factories in <unk> <unk> and <unk>
of <unk> n billion marks in group sales in <unk> n million marks came from sales of cfcs
also <unk> <unk> another large chemicals company said n it formed a separate division that will study the environmental impact of plastics and will investigate all possibilities of recycling plastics

<unk> <unk> who succeeds retiring <unk> <unk> <unk> will be responsible for gas supply regulatory affairs and marketing and transportation and exchange for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
all of the companies are units of <unk> <unk> <unk> which acquired <unk> <unk> <unk> earlier this year
<unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> its <unk> <unk> <unk> unit will test market a new line of bottled water in the <unk> beginning early next year
the move which was expected marks the first time since <unk> that <unk> has sold a non - alcoholic beverage and marks the company entry into a crowded but fast - growing market that generated about <unk> billion in sales last year
<unk> is hoping to become one of the first companies to distribute bottled water nationwide
<unk> sold by <unk> <unk> of <unk> a unit of <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> sold by a <unk> unit <unk> of <unk> are distributed to urban areas nationally but are less available in rural communities
<unk> with its large beer - distribution network could penetrate more markets
the company said n the water will be called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and will come from the same mountain spring as water used in <unk> beer
the company said n it will sell the water plain and with lemon - lime and cherry flavors and will package it in <unk> bottles and n ounce bottles as part of six - packs
the test markets though not specified will be in northern <unk> <unk> and <unk> some of the hottest bottled - water markets
some of <unk> biggest trading partners gave a quick thumbs - down to a <unk> proposal to liberalize world trade and reduce farm - product subsidies
in <unk> where world trade talks are being held under the <unk> <unk> on tariffs and <unk> or <unk> the <unk> <unk> called the <unk> proposal a step backward
and <unk> minister of agriculture forestry and fisheries told a committee of <unk> parliament that <unk> proposal was impractical and that <unk> would continue to heavily subsidize its rice farmers
the <unk> in a far - reaching plan submitted to the <unk> meeting <unk> proposed curbing price support subsidies within n years and eliminating export subsidies within five years
<unk> officials said n the plan was flexible and was intended as a pragmatic approach for gradually removing trade - distorting subsidies
but the <unk> reacted defiantly arguing that the proposal main aim is to destroy the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> billion - a-year price support program
the american proposal is not an adequate basis for negotiation the <unk> said in a statement
<unk> officials say n they are irked that the <unk> has set a specific timetable and is insisting on the elimination of export subsides not just reduction
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> the <unk> plan calls into question the agreement reached by world negotiators last <unk> in <unk> seeking substantial progressive reductions in agricultural support and protection
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> replied that the proposal was entirely consistent with the <unk> accord
he said <unk> he was surprised by the <unk> reaction calling it vehement even frenetic
the <unk> proposal also was criticized by food - importing developing countries who said that the <unk> made no special allowances for poor nations
while many experts argue that food - importing nations would eventually become self - sufficient in a free - market system the poorest nations are likely to need help in the meantime
<unk> <unk> said <unk> the <unk> was open to discussing particular problems of developing countries
the <unk> administration said <unk> its plan would allow considerable flexibility in determining how and when the free - trade goals would be achieved
the <unk> argues that its plan would ease the transition to freer agriculture trade by converting certain non - tariff barriers into tariffs that together with existing tariffs then would be phased out over n years
but the <unk> is strongly opposed to converting agricultural supports into tariffs
the new <unk> package also says n countries could temporarily raise tariffs on certain products if they experience an unusually heavy volume of imports
it would establish procedures <unk> to prevent countries from using health and sanitation rules to impede trade arbitrarily
seeking to allay european concerns <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said in <unk> that the new <unk> plan would n't put farmers out of business but would encourage them to grow what the markets desire instead of what the government wants
the <unk> with a population of n million has n million farmers while the <unk> with a population of about n million has only two million farmers
<unk> objections to the <unk> plan center around its desire to stay self - sufficient in rice a staple food even though foreign producers are far more efficient
<unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> it agreed definitively to acquire one of <unk> <unk> <unk> computer - maintenance businesses
terms of the accord were n't disclosed
<unk> <unk> third - party maintenance unit services products primarily made by <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> machines <unk>
the unit has n customers and according to one analyst had <unk> revenue of about n million
under the agreement which had been widely expected <unk> <unk> would be buying <unk> <unk> customer base and its approximately n <unk> maintenance facilities in about <unk> cities
however <unk> <unk> would continue to provide maintenance services for customers of its <unk> product line
the unit represents a small portion of <unk> - based <unk> <unk> overall computer - servicing business which last year posted sales of about n million
earlier this year the company sold a similar unit in <unk> for about n million
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> president and chief operating officer said <unk> the maintenance business no longer fits into the company strategy to be a data solutions company
<unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> customer services division said <unk> the acquisition would give the company <unk> computer - maintenance unit added expertise in the increasingly sophisticated workstation and high - end mainframe technologies
two recent decisions by federal courts cast judges in the odd role of telling authors how they should write history and biography
these decisions deserve more attention than they have received from scholars and from journalists as well
<unk> <unk> <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> is a biography of the founder of the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> <unk> who died in <unk> bequeathed the copyrights on his writings to his church which licensed them to <unk> <unk> <unk> a danish corporation
in <unk> <unk> <unk> sought a permanent injunction to restrain <unk> <unk> <unk> from publishing <unk> - <unk> <unk> on the ground that <unk> <unk> quotations from <unk> <unk> infringed the copyrights
the publisher argued in response that the fair use statute permits quotation for purposes such as criticism comment news reporting teaching scholarship or research
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> denied the injunction on the ground that <unk> <unk> had failed to make its claim within a reasonable time the doctrine n lawyers call laches
as for the merits <unk> <unk> said that <unk> <unk> had written a serious book of responsible historical criticism
<unk> quotation the judge believed n was justified in order to prove points n the author had asserted about <unk> <unk> mendacity bigotry paranoia and other unlovely traits that could not be persuasively demonstrated without use of <unk> <unk> own words
the biographer\/critic <unk> <unk> wrote should not be required simply to express conclusions without defending them by example
in such circumstances free - speech interests outweighed the interests of the copyright owner
but <unk> <unk> felt constrained by an earlier decision of the <unk> <unk> <unk> forbidding a biographer of <unk> <unk> to quote from <unk> <unk> personal letters
he distinguished the two cases in <unk> <unk> <unk> noted <unk> the quotations were for the purpose of enlivening the biography rather than of proving points about the subject
still the <unk> decision created a strong presumption against fair use of unpublished materials
<unk> <unk> reluctantly concluded that a few of <unk> <unk> quotations from <unk> <unk> unpublished writings because they were not necessary to prove historical points failed the fair - use test and therefore infringed copyright
but the proper remedy <unk> <unk> said n lay in a suit for damages not in an injunction
the case went on appeal to the <unk> <unk>
in a decision in <unk> of this year <unk> <unk> <unk> joined by <unk> <unk> <unk> agreed on denying the injunction and did not doubt that <unk> - <unk> <unk> was a serious work but rejected <unk> <unk> argument that the public interest in scholarship could outweigh the sanctity of copyright
we conclude the two judges wrote that laches is the sole bar to the issuance of an injunction
had the suit been filed in time they said <unk> <unk> - <unk> <unk> would have been suppressed
this was too much for <unk> <unk> the court chief judge
in a powerful separate opinion <unk> <unk> further distinguished the <unk> case by pointing out that a living person like <unk> <unk> had privacy rights that did not apply to a dead man like <unk> <unk>
i thought that <unk> might by being taken in another factual context come back to haunt us
this case realizes that concern
decisions by the <unk> <unk> itself <unk> <unk> continued <unk> had recognized that public interest in the subject matter and the indispensability in particular cases of verbatim quotations are vital components of fair use
and the injunction n judges <unk> and <unk> would so readily have granted had <unk> <unk> sued in time
suppression of the book <unk> <unk> observed <unk> would operate as a prior restraint and thus involve the <unk> <unk>
moreover and here <unk> <unk> went to the heart of the question responsible biographers and historians constantly use primary sources letters diaries and memoranda
indeed it would be irresponsible to ignore such sources of information
now scholars in fulfilling their responsibility do not claim the right to invade every collection of papers that bears upon their topics of investigation
and of course they agree that people can impose restrictions on the use of their papers whether in their own possession or as donated or sold to libraries
but in the <unk> - <unk> <unk> case the author found most of his material in court records or via the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
and when responsible scholars gain legitimate access to unpublished materials copyright should not be permitted to deny them use of quotations that help to establish historical points
judges <unk> and <unk> understand the requirements of historical scholarship
judges <unk> and <unk> do not appear to have a clue
yet at the moment they are the judges who are making the law
as matters stand the <unk> ruling torn from context and broadly construed is controlling
if an author quotes more than minimal amounts of unpublished copyrighted materials as the <unk> decision had it he deserves to be enjoined
the courts have not defined minimal amounts but publishers i understand <unk> take it to mean about <unk> words
the <unk> - <unk> <unk> decision strikes a blow against the whole historical enterprise
a second decision handed down in <unk> by the <unk> of appeals for the <unk> <unk> is another blow against scholarship
<unk> <unk> a professional writer on psychiatric matters wrote a series of articles for the <unk> <unk> later published in book form by <unk> under the title in the <unk> archives
the articles were largely based on interviews n <unk> <unk> had taped with <unk> <unk> a psychoanalyst who had served as projects director of the <unk> archives
<unk> <unk> then brought a libel suit against <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk>
as a public figure <unk> <unk> had to prove malice and as proof of malice <unk> <unk> contended that defamatory quotations ascribed to him by <unk> <unk> were in fact fabricated
the quotes could not be found on the tapes and the two judges who decided the case for <unk> <unk> and her publishers conceded that for the purpose of their decision we assume <unk> the quotations were deliberately altered
for all historians and most journalists this admission would have been sufficient to condemn the <unk> articles
but <unk> <unk> <unk> joined by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> took the astonishing position that it is perfectly ok to fabricate quotations so long as a judge finds that the fabrications do not alter substantive content or are rational interpretations of ambiguous remarks
in his eloquent dissent <unk> <unk> <unk> observed that when a writer uses quotation marks in reporting what someone has said the reader assumes that these are the speaker precise words or at least his words purged of uh and you know and grammatical error
while judges have an obligation under the <unk> <unk> to safeguard freedom of the press the right to deliberately alter quotations is not in my view a concomitant of a free press
<unk> <unk> for example wrote that <unk> <unk> described himself as the greatest analyst who ever lived
no such statement appears on the tapes
the majority cited <unk> <unk> remark it me alone against the rest of the analytic world as warrant for the <unk> fabrication
but as <unk> <unk> noted the context shows that <unk> <unk> me alone remark referred not to his alleged pre - eminence in his profession but to the fact that his position on a particular issue was not shared by anyone else
<unk> <unk> had <unk> <unk> describing himself as an intellectual gigolo
again no such statement appears on the tapes
the majority decision contended that the phrase was a rational interpretation of <unk> <unk> description of himself as a private asset but a public liability to <unk> <unk> and that in any case it was not defamatory
<unk> <unk> found the derivation entirely strained and writes that for an academic to refer to himself as an intellectual gigolo is a devastating admission of professional dishonesty
these were only two of a series of fabrications that had in <unk> <unk> words the cumulative effect of making <unk> <unk> appear more arrogant less sensitive shallower more self - aggrandizing and less in touch with reality than he appears from his own statements
as <unk> <unk> wrote in a review of <unk> <unk> book <unk> <unk> emerges as a grandiose egotist and in the end a self - destructive fool
but it is not <unk> <unk> who calls him such his own words reveal this psychological profile
we now know that the words were not always his own
there is one sacred rule of journalism <unk> <unk> has said
the writer must not invent
should the green light n judges <unk> and <unk> have given to the fabrication of quotations become standard practice it will notably reduce the value of journalism for historians and for citizens
as <unk> <unk> put it to invoke the right to deliberately distort what someone else has said is to assert the right to lie in print
<unk> has lost his case but the defendants and the profession to which they belong have lost far more
the historical profession will survive these decisions
perhaps in time the <unk> <unk> will correct them
but writing history is tough enough without judges gratuitously throwing obstacles in the scholar path
<unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> professor of the humanities at the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and a winner of <unk> prizes in history and biography
<unk> <unk> <unk> years old senior vice president marketing at <unk> <unk> <unk> was named president of <unk> records <unk> a unit of this entertainment concern
<unk> <unk> succeeds <unk> <unk> who resigned last month
legal controversies in <unk> have a way of assuming a symbolic significance far exceeding what is involved in the particular case
they speak volumes about the state of our society at a given moment
it has always been so
in the <unk> a young schoolteacher <unk> <unk> <unk> volunteered to be a guinea pig in a test case sponsored by the <unk> <unk> liberties <unk> to challenge a ban on the teaching of evolution imposed by the <unk> <unk>
the result was a world - famous trial exposing profound cultural conflicts in american life between the smart set whose spokesman was <unk> <unk> and the religious fundamentalists whom <unk> derided as benighted primitives
few now recall the actual outcome <unk> was convicted and fined <unk> and his conviction was reversed on appeal because the fine was excessive under <unk> law
so it was with the <unk> case a generation later when <unk> <unk> became a lightning rod for the anxieties of the <unk> <unk> and conflicting attitudes toward the <unk> <unk> <unk> he had served
his trials aroused public passions out of all proportion to the rather banal secrets n he allegedly had passed to soviet intelligence
and so it seems to be with the case of <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> plastic surgeon jailed in a child custody case for refusing to reveal the whereabouts of her daughter
<unk> <unk> has just emerged from the <unk> jail after more than two years confinement for contempt of court a heroine to her many supporters
to the rest of us the case is a puzzle
it is what lawyers call fact intensive
it presents no great issue of legal principle no overriding question of family law or the law of contempt
instead it turns on the disputed and elusive facts of who did what to whom
it is difficult if not impossible for anyone who has not pored over the thousands of pages of court pleadings and transcripts to have a worthwhile opinion on the underlying merits of the controversy
certainly i do not
so we must look elsewhere for an explanation of the unusual power n this case has exerted over the minds of many not just in <unk> but elsewhere in the country and even the world
i suggest that three themes have come together in the strange case of <unk> <unk>
the first is that it represents an intense battle in what <unk> <unk> used to caricature as the war between the sexes
but although <unk> did so gently and lightheartedly many of <unk> <unk> supporters have taken <unk> memorable title the <unk> <unk> quite literally
the vehemence of the emotions aroused by the case testifies to its symbolic importance in the war that <unk> accepted as an eternal part of the human condition
a second theme is the undercurrent of social class and race in the public reaction to the <unk> case
<unk> <unk> is a highly educated white professional who attended some of the best schools
as members of the <unk> <unk> in <unk> asked during the debate on the legislation that freed <unk> <unk> does anyone seriously believe that if she were an uneducated black working - class woman <unk> would have rushed to pass a private relief bill freeing her
or that the president would have hurried to sign the bill out of compassion for her plight
to ask those questions is to answer them
finally the case of <unk> <unk> gave <unk> an opportunity to act with unaccustomed decisiveness and to engage in one of its favorite pastimes bashing the <unk> of <unk> government
the local government is discredited in the eyes of many residents for a variety of reasons and congressmen read the same newspapers and watch the same tv newscasts as other people in the area do
bashing the <unk> government is risk - free for members of <unk> who do not have to answer to their own constituents for it
<unk> is paralyzed from acting on such great issues of the day as the federal budget deficit
yet a bill tailored to the interests of a single individual passed <unk> with almost unimaginable speed before the judicial process had run its course and indeed while the <unk> case was awaiting a ruling by the appellate court
the <unk> case thus tells us much more about the current state of sex class race and politics in our society than it does about the facts of <unk> <unk> particular situation
it may stand as a metaphor for how wide and deep the divisions in that society continue to be however we try to deny their existence
<unk> <unk> is a lawyer in <unk> <unk>

since then a second group of franchisees has banded together to try to wrestle control of the unit from <unk> <unk>

the earnings drop at <unk> <unk> electronics is a sign of tough times at both the defense operations of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> american automotive operations which are a primary customer for the <unk> electronics <unk> side of the <unk> <unk> unit
profit at the unit fell to n million or n cents a share from n million or n cents a share largely because of a n million one - time charge associated with <unk> previously announced plan to reduce employment by at least n people by year end
even excluding the charge however net fell n
in addition <unk> <unk> american vehicle production fell n from a year ago which hurt <unk> <unk> earnings a company spokesman said n
that decline was reflected in revenue for the <unk> <unk> unit which edged down to n billion from n billion
in the nine months <unk> <unk> net fell <unk> to n million or <unk> a share from n million or <unk> a share
revenue rose <unk> to n billion from n billion
at <unk> net dropped <unk> to n million from n million
the finance unit attributed the decline to higher borrowing costs compared with a year earlier

in the bidding war for <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> raised its proposed offer to one n it valued at n billion from n billion apparently topping all other bidders
the bids remain subject to evaluation by the federal bankruptcy court supervising <unk> of <unk> <unk> reorganization
they are also indirectly subject to approval by the state of <unk> <unk> where residents fear soaring rates <unk> to pay for the cost of reorganization
each of the four parties bidding for <unk> of <unk> <unk> proposes a complex financial package n to satisfy creditors and shareholders and also proposes a formula n to limit rate increases to satisfy the state
the new round of bidding would seem to complicate the decision making for <unk> <unk> <unk> the bankruptcy judge overseeing the case because the company stockholders unsecured creditors and regulators each are currently backing different plans
in addition some of the proposals are so close that non - financial issues such as timing may play a more important role
the unsecured creditors agreed in principle to support <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> new bid
they previously had backed an internal reorganization plan proposed by <unk> of <unk> <unk>
all of the bidders contemplate full payment including interest to secured creditors
<unk> <unk> plan however offers more for unsecured creditors
<unk> <unk> counsel to the official creditors committee said that under the <unk> <unk> plan unsecured creditors would be paid in full credits and interest of about n million accrued before <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> n filing for bankruptcy court protection
in addition they would receive some n million in payments for interest since then
<unk> <unk> said that by next <unk> they would have accrued unpaid interest equal to n million
other plans generally would n't pay unsecured creditors interest accrued since the filing
under <unk> <unk> plan a new holding company would be formed <unk> to own the two companies
it would be n by <unk> <unk> holders and n by current holders of <unk> of <unk> <unk> preferred and common stock
<unk> of <unk> <unk> preferred holders also would get certain debentures and preferred stock

common shareholders would end up owning about <unk> of the combined company
as previously reported <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> filed a bid n it valued at n billion
that offer was endorsed by the shareholders committee
the other bidders <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> of <unk> <unk> did n't change the value of their bids although <unk> of <unk> <unk> changed its rate proposal
<unk> <unk> <unk> values its offer at n billion and <unk> of <unk> <unk> values its reorganization plan at n billion
the bankruptcy judge has ruled that federal bankruptcy laws could be used to circumvent state regulation
however creditors and bidders alike concede that the state plays a major role because it could significantly delay final settlement of a plan n it did n't like
the state has endorsed the <unk> <unk> <unk> plan which promises to limit rate increases to <unk> annually for seven years
<unk> <unk> plan proposes n annual increases
<unk> of <unk> <unk> amended its plan to call for two years of n rate increases followed by five years of <unk> increases
fuel cost adjustments could change the effective rate increases however
previously it had proposed seven years of <unk> increases
<unk> <unk> also amended its rate plan
the new offer assumes just five years of n rate increases n to be followed by state - approved increases under the usual hearing procedure
previously <unk> <unk> had also called for seven years of <unk> increases
the bids and rate proposals generally assume n the <unk> nuclear power plant which is completed will go into operation

<unk> <unk> <unk> years old is currently vice president and chief operating officer of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> unit
<unk> <unk> will succeed <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who will hold the newly created position of chairman of the international unit until his retirement <unk> n
<unk> <unk> had n't noticed that his new desk had just four telephone lines and one phone
it was after all only his second full day as chairman of the securities and <unk> <unk>
but the lack of lines became painfully apparent
as the stock market lurched into a n free fall on <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> found himself scurrying around the sixth floor of the <unk> from his desk where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was on an open line to his assistant office where the <unk> futures <unk> <unk> was connected to a third room where a computer monitored market moves
with other anxious calls pouring in he recalls i either have to disconnect the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or go out to the secretary desk
it wo n't happen again
now there are more lines connected to the chairman office and the market - monitoring computer has been moved next to his desk
it all part of a new command center
the changes in the office layout illustrate <unk> <unk> stance as the nation top securities regulator
like his predecessor <unk> <unk> he was faced with a crisis in the stock markets soon after coming into office
but unlike <unk> <unk> who during the <unk> crash damaged himself by saying rather offhandedly that the markets might be closed <unk> <unk> is turning the market drop to his own advantage using it to further his agenda for the <unk>
in an interview and in congressional testimony he repeatedly points to the recent <unk> plunge in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the second - largest ever as evidence of the need for <unk> to give the <unk> the ability to better monitor leveraged buy - out loan activity by brokerage firms and to track big trades in the market
a veteran of another financial crisis the savings - and-loan bailout <unk> <unk> wants to have the <unk> regulate securities issued by banks and s&ls
more broadly he wants to modernize regulation by eliminating barriers between commercial and investment banking and by helping <unk> financial firms compete in the global market
he believes n the tax code encourages the use of debt instead of stock and may fuel leveraged buy - outs an area n the <unk> does n't regulate directly but one where it wields influence both on <unk> <unk> and in <unk>
also unlike <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> appears to be in a position n to get somewhere with his agenda
as a former <unk> <unk> aide who worked closely with <unk> he is savvy in the ways of <unk>
what more the coming months likely will offer him the opportunity to obtain his own majority on the five - member commission enabling him to avoid the dissension that frustrated his predecessor
but <unk> <unk> a <unk> securities lawyer has skirted some of the heftier issues facing the financial markets
for instance he has n't stated a clear position on high - risk high - yield junk bonds an area of growing concern as turmoil in the junk market spills over into stocks
he may be waiting to see the results of several pending <unk> studies of junk market liquidity and disclosure rules
he also has kept a close wrap on the names of people under consideration for the crucial post of enforcement director at the commission a job vacant since the summer
<unk> <unk> selection will be scrutinized as an important signal about the strength of his commitment to continuing the <unk> high - profile pursuit of insider trading and market manipulation on <unk> <unk>
<unk> seems likely to let the new chairman have his way for a while
members of the <unk> <unk> <unk> know <unk> <unk> from working on the thrift - bailout bill and the relationship generally remains warm
indeed during <unk> <unk> confirmation hearing last month senators asked him to introduce his children three separate times more often than they asked about his qualifications for the job
these days <unk> <unk> is winning praise in <unk> and on <unk> <unk> for his behind - the-scenes role in monitoring the n market plunge and the following <unk> harrowing morning session
as a regulator charged with restoring investor confidence <unk> <unk> avoided making market - jarring comments and worked to gather information critical to <unk> <unk> and to other government agencies
not everyone has jumped on the <unk> bandwagon however
some in <unk> contend that it too soon to tell whether <unk> <unk> will help or hinder the <unk>
i do n't think <unk> this was a real test says one congressional aide
it was a fairly stressful weekend but my sense is <unk> if you had n't had <unk> <unk> there it would n't have made much of a difference
for some at the <unk> an agency that covets its independence <unk> <unk> may be too much of a <unk> insider
they note that he has adorned his office with five photos of <unk> <unk> one of them featuring the <unk> <unk> <unk>
they worry that <unk> <unk> also will roll over when told to do so by the <unk> <unk>
but <unk> <unk> already has shown an eagerness to run the <unk> his way
during the <unk> market rebound a <unk> <unk> exchange spokesman told <unk> <unk> <unk> viewers that the industrial average had turned down n points
stunned <unk> <unk> turned to his market - monitoring computer which by then was next to his desk
it showed the <unk> up <unk> points
<unk> staffers soon determined that a widely watched stock - market service <unk> had miscalculated the industrial average
<unk> <unk> instructed <unk> staffers to inform the network that it was airing the wrong number
it was the plunge that did n't happen he says
<unk> <unk> also is trying to use a far more catastrophic event the <unk> earthquake to move another rule change past <unk>
that disaster closed the <unk> <unk> <unk> stock options - trading operation forcing those options to be switched to other exchanges temporarily
though obscure to most investors the question of whether to list options on more than one exchange has aroused much interest in <unk> mainly because regional exchanges fear <unk> the change could bankrupt them
congressmen raised the issue yesterday at a hearing
<unk> <unk> not missing a chance to press his agenda cited the earthquake
that event he contended n simply shows the vulnerability of having listings on only one exchange
in a corner of the cavernous new <unk> <unk> <unk> sits <unk> <unk> <unk> advanced - technology display
the highlight a fragrance control system
with the touch of a button drivers can choose from lavender jasmine mint or perfume scents all blown in through the car air - conditioning system
the soft wafting aromas will improve ride comfort the display attests <unk> and a proud employee says <unk> <unk> hopes to move the system out of the lab and into its cars in a year or two
welcome to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
here you can find <unk> motors <unk> displaying a live fish transporter a truck akin to an aquarium on wheels and <unk> <unk> <unk> with its keyless <unk> whose doors unlock upon recognizing the owner fingerprints
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> sport vehicle features a pop - out rear tent and invites drivers to go back to the nature
but this biennial event the world largest display of cars and trucks has its serious side including the first major exhibitions of future engines and vehicle - suspension systems
it also the prime showcase for a country whose world dominance in the industry is increasingly acknowledged and therein lies the draw
even the biggest auto shows in the <unk> are largely regional affairs but the <unk> show is international
virtually every automotive analyst in <unk> <unk> showed up
<unk> - to-tokyo flights were booked solid this week as <unk> <unk> executives including <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> flocked to see the future
even the <unk> <unk> came for the first time in n years to show off its <unk> <unk> sedan and its futuristic dark - blue <unk> model
here a firsthand look at what the japanese hosts sported and what the foreign visitors saw
new
the hottest displays were items that insulate passengers from bumps potholes and other rigors of the road
these active suspension systems electronically sense road conditions and adjust a car ride
existing suspension systems try to absorb bounces but active suspension provides power to counter the jolts
<unk> in a n tract modestly compares its hydraulic active suspension to a cheetah and equates the various parts to the animal heart brain nerves and blood vessels
<unk> <unk> <unk> grandly touted its system in a car that splits in half to reveal the suspension inner workings
<unk> says n it will introduce its first system next month on the <unk> <unk> luxury sedan and <unk> <unk> coupe will go on sale with the suspension device next spring
but drivers in the <unk> must wait the japanese for now are keeping active suspension for domestic use only
and <unk> <unk> <unk> auto makers say n their systems are still under development
in the engine department several companies displayed experimental models that within a decade could provide power equal to today engines and yet take up only half the space allowing for shorter hoods
in the so - called two - stroke engines which are expected to get sharply higher gas mileage each piston goes up and down only once to provide power
by contrast the pistons in conventional four - stroke engines must move up and down twice in each power cycle
the two - stroke engine displays by <unk> and <unk> <unk> industries the maker of <unk> cars drew plenty of interest from <unk> auto executives who are rushing to develop two - stroke engines
<unk> <unk> <unk> shows a more conventional five - cylinder engine in the new <unk> <unk> model which made its debut just this month in <unk> only
<unk> says n the five - cylinder engine provides a compromise between the fuel - economy of a four - cylinder and the power of a n
it is rumored to be bound for a new model in the luxury <unk> line in the <unk> but <unk> officials would n't comment
<unk> cars <unk>
there plenty of whimsy here but it is n't always clear whether it intentional
the show symbol is a woman riding on a snail not your usual metaphor for speed and agility
but the sponsors have an explanation through the character associated with a snail they say important values such as harmony with nature and aspirations for the future are sought
japanese auto makers are known for coming up with funny names but this year the practice seems to have reached a new high or low
<unk> has a tiny motorcycle called the <unk> and a slightly larger cousin the <unk>
<unk> has a futuristic delivery truck called the <unk>
<unk> has the <unk> truck and under its <unk> nameplate a microvan called the <unk>
its buglike <unk> minicar is designed with softness gentleness and warmheartedness
but the court jester appears to be <unk> smallest car maker <unk> <unk> <unk>
one of its futuristic concepts is the bubblelike <unk> which seats just one person in front and could hold a small child and bag of groceries in the rear
<unk> also has the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk>
the jokes are n't just on the japanese though
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the french auto maker has a concept car called the <unk>
the name is supposed to connote feminine grandeur but in japanese it means eyeglasses
foreign
foreign auto makers are taking the <unk> <unk> <unk> more seriously than ever
<unk> <unk> invites passers - by to play the role of the test dummy by hopping in a car that simulates a crash to show just how its seat - belt tightener works
<unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> has its first - ever exhibit in <unk>
<unk> motors <unk> is sponsoring its first independent display in n years and it includes a boxy <unk> station wagon with wood - grain side panels
<unk> and <unk> also have exhibits although theirs are tucked in a separate room with the less - popular automotive parts section
we got to get out of the <unk> mentality and be part of the world mentality declares <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> vice president for design in explaining his pilgrimage to the <unk> <unk>
even so traditional american cockiness is n't terribly endangered
<unk> officials for example crowed about their first - ever <unk> <unk> <unk> racing victory
true <unk> was declared the winner <unk> but only after the <unk> driver who crossed the finish line first was disqualified because it hit another car and skid momentarily out of bounds
<unk> <unk> of <unk> meanwhile still criticizes japanese styling
it hard for the japanese he says to get a feeling in a car to get a passion in a car to get emotion in a car
regarding your <unk> n <unk> <unk> column on the party differences over cutting capital gains or expanding iras why not compromise now and save the public from the coming infantile congressional political rhetoric that seems to go hand in hand with the process
the republicans maintain that a n capital - gains exclusion will raise revenue in the short term and spur economic investment while the democrats maintain that an increase in the top income - tax rate and expanded iras will raise revenue and spur savings
this is a classic example of the old saying the whole is greater than the sum of its parts
it ridiculous for a family with taxable income of <unk> to pay the same n incremental tax rate as a family with taxable income of <unk>
the n bracket should apply to all income over the applicable level not just the <unk> rate adjustment amount
it equally ridiculous not to provide a capital investment or retirement - savings tax incentive
<unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> said n it plans to sell by spring <unk> all <unk> passenger planes n it acquired earlier this year in its n million canadian dollar <unk> n million purchase of <unk> <unk>
<unk> which recently merged <unk> operations with those of <unk> - owned <unk> airlines <unk> <unk> <unk> second - biggest airline said <unk> the proposed sale is part of a revised five - year plan aimed at streamlining its fleet and shedding debt
<unk> would n't estimate the value of <unk> aircraft which include <unk> <unk> <unk> and three <unk> <unk>
but <unk> <unk> a <unk> - based technical analyst with <unk> <unk> an aircraft evaluation firm estimated the total half - life value of the <unk> planes at about n million or more
<unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> aircraft that <unk> also said n it plans to sell beginning in <unk> have a current half - life value of about n million each or a total <unk> million raising aggregate potential proceeds from the aircraft sale to about <unk> billion
<unk> <unk> said <unk> current demand for used aircraft is strong partly because surging orders for new aircraft have lengthened waiting lists
he predicted that <unk> would have little difficulty attracting prospective buyers
under its revised fleet plan <unk> said <unk> it will also increase its existing fleet of eight <unk> <unk> aircraft to <unk> by <unk> and add four more <unk> <unk> by <unk> to the two units that it previously planned to add by next year
<unk> said n two of the <unk> <unk> aircraft scheduled for delivery in <unk> would be leased out for two to five years
<unk> did n't disclose the expected net cost of the fleet overhaul but a <unk> - based analyst estimated it at about n million <unk> excluding replacement costs for the <unk> <unk> aircraft that <unk> plans to sell and purchase costs for as many as <unk> <unk> <unk> aircraft that <unk> previously ordered
i do n't see this as a debt reduction exercise
it focused on streamlining <unk> fleet in a bid to cut training and aircraft servicing costs the analyst said <unk>
<unk> long - term debt and capital lease obligations rose to c$ n billion at the end of the second quarter nearly double the year - earlier figure reflecting debt absorbed under the <unk> purchase
<unk> said n it also expects to announce by <unk> whether it will take delivery of all <unk> <unk> <unk> aircraft n it previously ordered
the first five leased units were to be delivered in <unk>
this british banking and financial - services group investment - banking arm <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> announced the following appointments at its merchant - banking subsidiary <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> years old was named a deputy chairman
<unk> <unk> is currently a director at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> was named to the new post of chief executive officer of the merchant - banking corporate - finance division
<unk> <unk> <unk> was named to the new post of deputy head of the corporate - finance division and a managing director
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> join <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk> where they served as directors
the recent bids for <unk> and <unk> airlines have led <unk> to move with supersonic speed to protect incumbent airline managements
the <unk> is scheduled to vote today on an anti - airline-takeover bill that would block for up to <unk> days any bid for n or more of a <unk> airline even a straight cash purchase
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who earlier fueled the anti - takeover fires with his quasi - xenophobic attacks on foreign investment in <unk> carriers now says n the bill would further disturb the jittery capital markets
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who has n <unk> airlines workers in his district says n the bill is good politics but bad law
it is ironic that at a time when <unk> partial airline deregulation is being emulated by governments from <unk> <unk> to <unk> so many in <unk> favor an incumbent - protection program for airlines that would be more appropriate for the soviet airline <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> told <unk> that the <unk> can wipe out inflation without causing a recession but he said doing so will inflict some short - term pain and will require reducing the federal deficit sharply
<unk> <unk> said n he and other <unk> governors endorse a bill by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that would require the <unk> to pursue policies aimed at eliminating inflation within five years
such a deadline is attainable but it would have costs <unk> <unk> told <unk> <unk> monetary policy subcommittee n
the <unk> chief opposed a bill introduced by reps . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that among other things would require the <unk> to disclose all monetary policy moves immediately and increase outside scrutiny of the <unk>
in responding to questions <unk> <unk> played down reports of tension between the <unk> and the <unk> over exchange - rate policy
what seem to be interpreted as great conflicts are relatively minor issues of tactics he said
he did n't elaborate
but the <unk> is n't enthusiastic about <unk> efforts to bring down the value of the dollar through intervention in foreign - exchange markets and the <unk> is frustrated at the <unk> reluctance to cut interest rates to pull down the dollar value
<unk> <unk> said <unk> the inflation rate currently about n n could be brought down to levels which are close to zero without putting the economy into a recession but i do suspect that there might be some modest loss of economic output
in other words economic growth would be lower and unemployment would be higher for a few years
but <unk> <unk> who has repeatedly said <unk> the <unk> goal is to reduce inflation added that whatever losses are incurred in the pursuing of price stability would surely be more than made up in increased output thereafter
he warned that <unk> efforts to conquer inflation would fail and could produce a major financial crunch unless they are accompanied by a significant reduction in the federal deficit which causes the government to borrow heavily
<unk> <unk> bill originally called on the <unk> to reduce the inflation rate by one percentage point a year for five years and to maintain a zero inflation rate thereafter
he altered the wording to win <unk> <unk> endorsement
even so his bill is given little chance of passage
<unk> . <unk> and <unk> also have altered their bill dropping a proposal to add the <unk> secretary to the <unk> <unk> committee that makes monetary policy
instead the bill simply calls for twice - a-year meetings between the committee and top administration officials
even that met with <unk> <unk> disapproval because it might subject the <unk> to a more intensely political perspective and could risk bending monetary policy away from long - term strategic goals
while each of the <unk> - <unk> proposals represents only a small step together they would erode the <unk> independence <unk> <unk> said <unk>
<unk> <unk> also said that although he favors cutting capital - gains taxes as sound economic policy he would oppose such a move if it would undo the political compromise embodied in the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> and result in higher marginal income tax rates
<unk> <unk> <unk> signed a contract with <unk> <unk> the former host of the popular public television program <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to star in a half - hour home improvement show sponsored by the giant retailer
the do - it-yourself show slated to start airing by <unk> n marks sears entry into the burgeoning market of home repair television programs and could bolster sales of its home improvement products
in recent months sales of home improvement items have sagged along with sales of other big ticket durable goods
the show also signals <unk> <unk> return as a television celebrity
earlier this year public television station <unk> in <unk> fired <unk> <unk> after a sponsor protested some of his numerous commercial endorsements
with <unk> <unk> as host <unk> <unk> <unk> became one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> top n programs airing weekly on about <unk> of the network stations and seen by an average of n million viewers
but <unk> <unk> <unk> an <unk> - based home center chain objected when <unk> <unk> started doing commercial endorsements for <unk> <unk> centers a <unk> <unk> building supply company that competes with <unk> <unk> in some markets
i ecstatic about the change said <unk> <unk> whose new syndicated program is called <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>
in an interview <unk> <unk> criticized his old show which is continuing with a new host
public tv is in fantasy land he said
last season we did a story that involved spending n in converting a two - family house into a bed and breakfast
in the new show he said n we going to spend <unk> building a start - up house for a young couple
while <unk> would n't comment on the brouhaha over <unk> <unk> commercial endorsements it appears to be building a fence around <unk> <unk> affections
his contract makes him exclusive spokesman for <unk> home improvement marketing campaigns
<unk> <unk> in <unk> a unit of <unk> <unk> <unk> will handle the advertising account and syndication
the only other endorsement permitted by the contract involves a series of <unk> - <unk> home improvement and repair books
his other agreements to promote products have expired
little matter for <unk> <unk> who complains that public tv never paid me more than <unk> a year
he said <unk> his compensation under the <unk> contract is a multimillion dollar deal

he is president and chief executive officer of <unk> <unk> in <unk>
the <unk> <unk> has decided to push for changes in pesticide law that are designed to speed the removal of harmful chemicals from the nation food supply
the proposed changes which are scheduled to be announced today would apply to pesticides and other substances found on fresh and processed foods according to federal officials
environmental groups have been calling for faster action on dangerous pesticides and may welcome part of the proposal
but they are already objecting to among other things a plan to give more weight to cost - benefit considerations in evaluating pesticides
it a tremendous disappointment said <unk> <unk> an attorney with the <unk> resources <unk> <unk>
allowing the <unk> to condone continued use of a chemical whenever the benefits outweigh the risks is absolutely anathema to the environmental community
the <unk> administration plans to announce a series of principles and to work with congressional leaders in writing specific legislative proposals that embody them
the principles would give the <unk> <unk> <unk> increased authority and flexibility in regulating pesticides with the aim of enabling the agency to move more quickly
there already are proposals pending in <unk> to overhaul pesticide law
moves to accelerate the removal of dangerous pesticides gained new impetus during this year <unk> scare when the <unk> was harshly criticized for failing to yank the possible carcinogen a growth regulator used to make apples redder and crunchier
the agency has since acted to remove <unk> from the nation grocery shelves by <unk> <unk> <unk> and the apple industry has said that growers already have stopped using the chemical
in addition the principles attempt to eliminate the so - called <unk> <unk>
under the <unk> clause which applies to processed food a chemical is banned if it causes cancer in laboratory animals
under other laws applying to pesticide use however that same chemical could be allowed to be used on fresh food if it fell within the <unk> tolerance level
among other changes the <unk> <unk> wants to
give the <unk> more flexibility n to declare a pesticide an imminent hazard and pull it from the marketplace
speed up the process for removing a pesticide that is n't an imminent hazard
bar states from setting more stringent tolerance levels for a pesticide once the federal government has set a standard
give the <unk> added discretion n to set negligible risk levels for pesticide residues in processed food
chemicals that exceed these risk levels would be barred but those that fall below these levels would be allowed
allow the <unk> to permit the continued use of pesticides that exceed its negligible risk standard if the benefits of doing so outweigh the cost
financial markets took a midweek break from their recent wild gyrations with stock prices falling modestly bond prices posting tiny gains and the dollar almost unchanged
the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> lost n points to <unk> in moderate trading
long - term <unk> bonds rose slightly despite the arrival on the market of <unk> billion in <unk> bonds offered by the <unk> <unk> <unk> as part of the government bailout of the savings and loan industry
the dollar was barely changed against the west german mark and up marginally against the japanese yen
yesterday sluggish action was in marked contrast to the rearing and plunging of stock prices <unk> after the proposed buy - out of <unk> <unk> once again collapsed
traders said <unk> the stock market lurching moves have prompted many investors to head for the sidelines until it regains some semblance of stability
although bond prices were n't as volatile on <unk> trading as stock prices traders nevertheless said n action also was much slower yesterday in the <unk> market
bond investors paid close attention to comments by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who was testifying before a congressional hearing but were n't able to extract many clues about the future course of the <unk> monetary policy
many analysts are expecting the <unk> to lower interest rates at least once more before the end of the year
investors now are awaiting today release of the preliminary estimate of third - quarter gross national product
economists predict n the report will show economic growth of about <unk> in the third quarter which would have little effect on financial markets
but an unexpected deviation either way could roil bond and currency markets
in major market activity
stock prices slipped lower in moderate trading
volume on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> totaled n million shares
but advancing issues on the <unk> <unk> were ahead of decliners <unk> to n
bond prices inched higher
the <unk> benchmark <unk> issue rose less than an eighth of a point or less than n for each n of face amount
the yield on the issue stood at <unk>
the dollar was virtually unchanged
in late <unk> <unk> trading the <unk> currency was quoted at n marks and n yen compared with n marks and n yen <unk>
a few years ago i was on a panel of journalists that discussed the image of intercollegiate athletics for an audience of campus information directors and others
we scribblers quickly concurred that not only was the bad rep of big - time college sports richly earned but also that it could be corrected
competition could be maintained and stadiums probably would remain full if schedules were reduced and the games returned to the students we said <unk>
comments from the audience reflected widespread if wistful agreement with those conclusions
as the session broke up i was approached by a man who identified himself as the alumni director of a <unk> <unk> university
i love to see sports cut back and so would a lot of my counterparts at other schools but everybody afraid to make the first move he confided
it like the <unk> and the russians <unk> wants to disarm first
and so our institutions of higher learning lurch from scandal to scandal on gridiron and basketball court while the casualties mount
three new books make the point that one large price of the glittery college - sports show can be the integrity of the schools that stage it
they are <unk> <unk> <unk> to meet <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> at <unk> <unk> <unk> pages <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> pages n by <unk> <unk> and <unk> too young to die the death of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> pages <unk> by <unk> <unk>
the pick of the group is <unk> it should be required reading for every college president
it chronicles how over a period of a dozen years <unk> <unk> <unk> bought its way to football respectability in the <unk> <unk> only to find itself trapped and strangled by the athlete - payoff system n it created

there a memorable passage in which <unk> <unk> having finally learned of the practice expresses his outrage to <unk> <unk> then a university governor and now the governor of <unk> and oil man <unk> <unk> chairman of the board of trustees
you stay out of it author <unk> quotes <unk> <unk> as saying
go run the university
which was about what <unk> <unk> did and quietly until he resigned a few years later pleading ill health when the stuff hit the fan
<unk> <unk> drew on voluminous news media coverage of the <unk> scandal and on a university internal investigation
<unk> <unk> had to do most of his own digging on <unk> of <unk> football which is to date high and dry as far as the <unk> is concerned
unfortunately he gets low grades as an investigative reporter relying heavily on what <unk> late mayor <unk> <unk> <unk> called insinuendo
discrepancies go unexplained in <unk> one ex - player claims n he received <unk> to n for his season football tickets while others said n theirs brought only a few hundred dollars and when <unk> <unk> ca n't nail down something like who really owned a car driven by <unk> tailback <unk> <unk> he simply reprints his notes
there are gratuitous references to supposed romantic liaisons between <unk> players and a low - level female university employee
a serious charge that star flanker <unk> <unk> threw the <unk> <unk> <unk> game by intentionally dropping a pass in the end zone is included even though the <unk> assistant coach quoted denied making it

it a mystery how this could have escaped the notice of <unk> coaches
probably it did n't
never <unk> <unk> is a different sort of work focusing on the <unk> death from cocaine ingestion of <unk> a <unk> of <unk> basketball star ticketed for sure pro stardom
while the university was no more to blame for that than for the similar fate of any other student it must bear responsibility for its conduct in the aftermath
<unk> coach <unk> <unk> ordered the room in which <unk> died to be cleaned before the police could arrive the order was n't carried out and the school athletics director issued false information about the academic standing of <unk> and other players
those of course were the responses of people with something n to hide

<unk> - <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> a unit of <unk> - <unk> <unk> paid <unk> <unk> million in taxes bringing to an end a n corporate tax chase
officials at the <unk> of <unk> had dogged the foreign car maker for taxes owed on business transactions and were proceeding to settle the dispute in court
but the check arrived in the mail said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>
<unk> - <unk> which had said <unk> it did n't owe taxes to <unk> partly because it sells its cars at a dock in <unk> and not in <unk> did n't explain its change of heart
last month <unk> - <unk> executives approached state revenue officials complaining about bad press the commissioner said <unk>
the dispute was the subject of a <unk> <unk> <unk> article in <unk>
the amount covers taxes interest and penalties owed from <unk> when the state began collecting corporate taxes to <unk>

as part of the plan the <unk> - based company <unk> <unk> <unk> stores will be refocused to target black hispanic upscale or core middle - class customers
stores in upper - income neighborhoods for instance will carry high - priced wines publications such as <unk> <unk> gourmet pasta sauces oat bran cereals and <unk> watchers and <unk> products

stores in the company core middle - class market will get more frozen and quick - to-prepare foods and a greater selection of bottled water
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> president and chief executive officer said n the move reflects the company realization that the industry poor performance stems from its failure to give customers what they want rather than from increasing competition from gasoline stations and n grocery stores
convenience store merchandise has not kept pace with current trends in consumer preferences he said in a speech at the company annual shareholders meeting
analysts and competitors said n the move reflects a growing need by the stores to expand their customer base beyond the traditional blue - collar worker who pops into a convenience store for a sandwich cigarettes soda or beer
there are an increasing number of people out there who are time - poor said <unk> <unk> retail analyst with <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>
those are primarily white - collar workers a customer segment that has historically proved elusive for convenience stores
<unk> <unk> move is likely to be echoed by other chains though analysts note that <unk> <unk> owner of <unk> stores and <unk> <unk> <unk> are too debt - heavy to roll out such an extensive effort
still <unk> said that its franchisees have been targeting their merchandise to their customers for years and that the company has begun to follow suit
for instance <unk> has expanded its bottled water selection in some stores and added fresh sandwiches in some outlets
several months ago it also added black health and beauty aids displays to many stores a spokeswoman said n
we certainly see an increasing trend toward that she added
<unk> <unk> said n it has tested its new merchandise mix in <unk> stores with favorable results
analysts said n the company effort will be helped by its decision last year to put point - of-sale scanners in <unk> stores allowing <unk> <unk> to quickly track items that are selling and those that are n't
to promote its new strategy <unk> <unk> said n it plans to spend about n million on advertising for the year ending <unk> <unk> up from about n million in fiscal <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> named a mediator n to help resolve the lengthy labor dispute between the <unk> <unk> workers and <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> labor secretary during the <unk> administration was named to mediate talks to settle the six - month strike by the <unk>
previous talks between <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the union have been sporadic and unsuccessful
the union called the strike in <unk> after <unk> refused to sign the <unk> national labor pact
<unk> seeks changes in health and pension benefits among other things
no schedule for formal talks was set but meetings are expected to begin soon
one day after <unk> <unk> made top management changes and disclosed the end of an important business tie its stock did n't trade and the company forecast a significant drop next year in sales of its core product
that disclosure came a <unk> spokeswoman said n after the <unk> <unk> <unk> alerted the company that trading would n't resume in its stock until additional information about developments was provided
in addition to the forecast the company also said n it is examining potential cost cuts and reductions in overhead
the spokeswoman said <unk> the exchange would resume trading of <unk> stock today
<unk> which makes and sells peritoneal dialysis products used in treating kidney disease on <unk> announced the resignations of <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman president and chief executive officer and of <unk> <unk> <unk> chief operating officer and chief financial officer
they were succeeded by executives of <unk> <unk> <unk> and its parent <unk> <unk> which owns about n of <unk>
at the same time the <unk> <unk> <unk> company said <unk> negotiations about pricing and volumes of product had collapsed between it and its exclusive distributor in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
following that announcement <unk> however company officials were unavailable to elaborate
yesterday the spokeswoman said n sales of <unk> products through the exclusive arrangement with <unk> <unk> accounted for n of <unk> <unk> sales of n million
the current distribution arrangement ends in <unk> n although <unk> said <unk> it will continue to provide some supplies of the peritoneal dialysis products to <unk> <unk> the spokeswoman said n
nonetheless <unk> currently expects that <unk> sales will be significantly below their n level the company said <unk> in a statement
<unk> said yesterday that <unk> <unk> would begin distributing the product and that the company is investigating other possible distribution channels
in any case supplies to patients wo n't be interrupted the company added n
<unk> a west german pharmaceutical concern has been discussing a transaction in which it would buy <unk> stock for cash to bring its beneficial ownership to between <unk> and <unk>
the transaction also would combine <unk> <unk> and <unk>
but the plan now is being reformulated <unk> said declining to provide most of the new terms of the combination
said the spokeswoman the whole structure has changed
the value of the company has changed
<unk> did say that the proposal still would infuse cash into <unk> but less than the <unk> million originally expected
<unk> also would receive the north american rights to certain <unk> <unk> products
another option for <unk> the company said <unk> is that it could sell its plant in <unk> <unk>
it added that no discussions about such a sale are under way
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> never wanted to get into money laundering
but <unk> <unk> a thunderstorm in <unk> <unk> caused <unk> <unk> to rise n feet pouring n million gallons of water into basement vaults
the water destroyed about n million in currency and caked n million of coins with mud rendering them dangerous to counting machines
the n million in paper money although moldy mildewy and smelly was exchanged through the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> without incident
but <unk> was unable to reach a coin - cleaning agreement with the government
we kind of got caught between bureaucracies says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the <unk> <unk> would n't take the coin because it was n't mutilated and the <unk> <unk> <unk> accepts only clean coins he says n
the <unk> <unk> says n it is merely an agent for coins responsible only for storage and distribution
we issue paper money we destroy paper money says <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> spokeswoman
the coin is their problem
a <unk> official says <unk> the agency offered to clean the coins for its bare - bones cost of <unk> plus certain other expenses
but <unk> declined figuring that transporting the mucked up money to <unk> would cost the company thousands more
so <unk> gave the dirty work to <unk> <unk> <unk> which came up with an unusual solution
for eight hours a day for the past two weeks in aggregates of as much as <unk> pounds equaling n in pennies <unk> <unk> has been pouring money into a cement - mixing truck
a giant heater working like a blowtorch causes the mud to crust and burns off any wrappers
after clanging around for an hour or so the shiny hot money pours out of the cement chute where a giant vacuum sucks away the dried mud and burnt wrappers
after cooling the coins are then rewrapped
<unk> expects to pay <unk> <unk> a total of about <unk> a cost that insurance wo n't cover

not only did his company find <unk> worth of work but when the approach was suggested <unk> <unk> says <unk> <unk> officials did n't laugh at me or anything
parenthood this summer successful and amusing movie about parents and children apparently was only the beginning
it seems that every day a new movie opens featuring a child coping with a mother death or adoption or aging parents or pregnancy
and why not
some of our best and most idiosyncratic film makers from <unk> to <unk> to <unk> <unk> have taken a cue from <unk> when it comes to compelling drama there no place like home
yet too many people working in <unk> today seem to suffer from the delusion that the drama played out in every home will be interesting to people who live somewhere else
this is not the case
some diaries simply are n't worth snooping in
yet there will be people who will sob at <unk> <unk> a limply constructed and offensive movie about adoption
these are the sensitive souls who can empathize with and even enjoy hearing about other people troubles no matter how haltingly or predictably the sad tale is told
written by <unk> <unk> <unk> - author of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> takes the position that only rich people living in nice houses should have children
the film makers have couched this offensive idea in pretty packaging
everyone is very nice and good - looking the adoptive parents <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and the teen - age couple who decide to give up their baby for adoption <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> who seem to be pushing n live in a large and tastefully decorated home in suburban <unk>
all of their friends have children and they ca n't so now they want a child more than anything perhaps even more than <unk> wanted his fancy convertible or his deluxe stereo equipment
the idea of a child - as-required-yuppie-possession must be motivating them since the wealthy offspring of their friends are shown to be rude brats in therapy by age five
having exhausted all modern aids to fertility <unk> and <unk> decide to adopt
the actors wear pained expressions to indicate their genuine longing for a little one or maybe they not - so-subtly commenting on the inadequacy of the script and <unk> <unk> the <unk> dull direction
or maybe they are disgusted by the literal - minded musical score when a character arrives at a major decision her thoughts are revealed by the sound of i can see clearly now
the adoption agency insists on introducing the adopting parents to the birth mother so <unk> and <unk> pay for pregnant <unk> <unk> <unk> bus ticket from <unk>
why in these movies is the unwed pregnant woman always from <unk>
i ask this not necessarily as a native <unk>
<unk> of course is pretty and smart though uneducated
everyone falls in love with everyone else
there is some pain when <unk> has the baby and did n't know <unk> she would feel like this and wants to keep the baby
but in the end everything turns out for the best in the film makers warped view
like lawyers in the hostile takeover field the baby goes where the money is
at the other end of the life cycle is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> adaptation of the <unk> <unk> novel
this picture is about a middle - aged son who makes sure that his delayed bond with his father will last by waiting to cement it until just before the old man dies
the glib emotional style <unk> <unk> <unk> has perfected on television <unk> ties does n't benefit from magnification
his characters practically scamper through a vast range of human emotions like travelers doing n cities in eight days
they pause only to register little whimpers of distress and sighs of satisfaction like tourists cataloging the sights n they seen from the window of a bus
not even <unk> <unk> expert doddering makes this trip worth taking
so it entirely possible that look who <unk> is n't as entertaining as it seems in comparison to the turgid other films opening now
but by comparison this fluffy comedy seems like a gem
it starts with conception taking the sperm point of view then progresses to the baby point of view
<unk> <unk> best attribute as an actor is his coy lazy voice and that all n you get of him here speaking for the baby
finally there is one family movie that quite eloquently explores the depth of human emotion only its stars are bears
for the second time in a movie called the <unk> <unk> director <unk> - <unk> <unk> demonstrates just how powerful pictures can be
<unk> for <unk> was the first time
to be sure one wonders what kind of man is this who feels compelled to try to understand the most primitive longing and instinct in a way that requires the most sophisticated appreciation of visual storytelling
supposedly he proposed the movie to his producer <unk> <unk> in four lines
an orphan bear cub
a big solitary bear
two hunters in the forest
the animals point of view
but then even a great many words could n't summarize the extraordinary pull of this movie about an orphaned bear who adopts a parent
<unk> <unk>
one of the best movies about the child - parent thing in recent years was raising <unk> the <unk> <unk> brothers comedy that definitely was not about the folks next door
<unk> <unk> <unk> capitalizing on a major restructuring program expects operating margins of more than <unk> and double - digit per - share earnings growth next year top officers told securities analysts here n
<unk> <unk> <unk> chairman and chief executive officer also said n the company expects sales from continuing businesses to rise n annually through the next three years
in <unk> the company earned n million or <unk> a share on sales of n billion
since <unk> <unk> has shed n businesses that it did n't expect to produce <unk> operating margins while acquiring n businesses
in the past n months alone <unk> <unk> <unk> president and chief operating officer said <unk> the divestiture of n million of slow - growth low - profit businesses has been more than offset by n million in profitable acquisitions
<unk> expects to meet its corporate goals despite a softening in the economy
even if the gross national product is either flat or in the growth range of <unk> to n we can handle that <unk> <unk> said <unk>
gnp is the total value of the nation output of goods and services
a bright spot is the company power - generation business which is experiencing a surge of growth for the first time in years
<unk> <unk> said n the business will achieve higher sales this year than the company target goal of <unk>
while <unk> has n't had a nuclear power plant order from a <unk> utility in about a decade excess capacity is beginning to shrink
<unk> <unk> said n the company foresees the need for a major boost in new - generation capability throughout the n
<unk> also is well positioned to sell steam turbine and gas turbine plants to independent power producers
the company ability to respond to energy needs world - wide will be enhanced through a recently announced venture with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said n
he said n the independent power segment could grow to provide as much as <unk> of near - term generation capacity adding we expect to supply a significant share of this market
<unk> also expects its international sales to soon grow to <unk> of total corporate sales from <unk> last year
the company is negotiating with the soviets to build a <unk> <unk> truck - refrigeration plant that would produce about n units annually
<unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> would own n of the facility
the deal which will involve an initial n million investment was struck with a handshake he added n
company officials also said that any gain from the sale of <unk> <unk> stake in its transmission and distribution venture with the swiss firm of <unk> <unk> <unk> will be offset by a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter
the executives did n't disclose the size of the expected gain
capital expenditure in <unk> will rise slightly <unk> <unk> said <unk> from an estimated n million this year

because of an error by the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> the listing appeared incorrectly in the main table and several highlight tables in yesterday edition
a proposed conflict - of-interest policy for federally funded biomedical researchers may thwart many high - technology new ventures say n financiers researchers and university administrators
the <unk> institutes of <unk> policy would require researchers to cut financial ties with health - care businesses or lose their government money
among other concerns the agency says <unk> researchers with business ties are more likely to falsify findings in order to tout new drugs
as ties between academia and venture capital have blossomed in recent years governmental fear of abuse has risen
but the guidelines could make it impossible to commercialize research says <unk> <unk> <unk> associate provost and vice president for research at <unk> <unk> of <unk>
the <unk> is asking grant recipients and others for comments on the proposed guidelines until <unk> n
after that it will make a final decision on the policy
the guidelines could foil future arrangements similar to the deal behind <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> start - up says <unk> <unk> <unk> a managing partner of <unk> associates a venture - capital firm
with n million he and other investors launched <unk> last year to market a gallstone cure being developed by researchers of the <unk> of <unk> at <unk> <unk>
the researchers who are being financed by the <unk> funds will receive a royalty or percentage of sales if their research yields a commercial product
but because the <unk> of <unk> like many other universities shares its royalties with researchers it may disqualify itself from federal funds under the proposed guidelines <unk> <unk> says <unk>
the high - tech industry is full of the kind of arrangement that the new guidelines would affect
for instance <unk> <unk> <unk> a venture - capital concern last month invested n to launch <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> concern that will produce pharmaceuticals
scientists <unk> <unk> - <unk> and <unk> <unk> conducted the initial research at the <unk> <unk> of <unk>
while <unk> <unk> - <unk> left <unk> to head <unk> <unk> . <unk> will continue to work at <unk> serve on <unk> board and own a small equity stake in the company
the <unk> transaction is typical of the way n venture - capital firms are approaching the task of commercializing biotechnology research
while universities develop the basic research venture capitalists are the ones best positioned to finance its commercialization says <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>
this is the best way n to transfer technology straight off the campuses of universities
but the new guidelines could prevent scientists like <unk> . <unk> from being involved with start - ups such as <unk> venture capitalists point out n
and if that happens the entire process of transferring technology to the marketplace could be harmed they say n
the stakes in the controversy are large
last year venture capitalists spent an estimated n million to finance start - up companies in medical and biotechnology businesses according to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a trade group
many of the deals involved transactions in which scientific institutions or researchers agreed to commercialize their work in return for an equity stake or royalties
in many of these deals venture capitalists had the inside track says <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
investors were willing to gamble on new technologies because we had exclusive rights to those technologies he adds n
but under the proposed guidelines all federally funded research will have to be reported publicly so that anyone can capitalize on the work
without the exclusivity most venture capitalists wo n't have the incentive to invest in such deals <unk> <unk> says
last year for example <unk> and others invested n million in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to license and develop technology for delivery of drugs to the brain
but before <unk> was able to get an exclusive license to the technology the <unk> <unk> published most of the details giving all of the company potential competitors a chance to exploit it <unk> <unk> says <unk>
<unk> eventually acquired exclusive rights to the technology and currently is developing it
but says <unk> <unk> it was a close call
the proposed guidelines could also delay commercialization and force small companies to waste scarce capital entrepreneurs say n
if start - ups ca n't have early access to research being conducted at institutions we have to replicate it ourselves or do without the research says <unk> <unk> <unk> manager of business development at <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> concern
duplicating research is both costly and time - consuming for a start - up <unk> <unk> says <unk>
for its part <unk> insists that its guidelines should not stifle research creativity or technology transfer from the research laboratory to commercial use
universities such as <unk> and <unk> should be able to develop a way n to act as brokers for the individual scientists says <unk> <unk> <unk> who oversees the huge <unk> grants program as its deputy director for extramural research
<unk> staff members believe n the guidelines are essential to prevent the escalation of problems that have already begun to surface in scientific ventures
not long ago scientists holding stock in <unk> <unk> services <unk> were accused of falsifying research to boost the stock
many officials are also concerned about companies getting a free ride on government - sponsored research
a congressional subcommitee has been investigating the potential abuse from researchers holding stock in companies exploiting their research
among other provisions the <unk> guidelines would prohibit researchers and members of their immediate families from holding stock in any company that is affected by the outcome of their research
<unk> <unk> the <unk> administrator says <unk> the business and scientific community is overreacting to what the agency merely meant to be ideas for discussion
the predictions of doom are premature she says n
but when agencies like the <unk> circulate guidelines they often already formulated policy veteran scientists say n
indeed institutions already are taking note
on <unk> <unk> <unk> began circulating a conflict - of-interest policy statement that in effect would follow the <unk> guidelines faithfully
the <unk> of <unk> at <unk> <unk> is also circulating a memo among its scientific faculty that will restrict contact with the world of business
in many other institutions scientists are shunning contacts with venture investors until the <unk> policy is settled
says <unk> <unk> the venture capitalist it does n't matter whether they call it guidelines or policy
the damage is already done

<unk> jewelers <unk> a fast - growing jewelry store chain filed for chapter n bankruptcy - law protection from creditors apparently to speed a management buy - out of the chain
the filing made yesterday in <unk> <unk> <unk> here follows an agreement by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> owner to sell the chain to management for an undisclosed price
<unk> <unk> <unk> a financial services subsidiary of <unk> <unk> <unk> is providing <unk> management with n million in financing
<unk> <unk> based in <unk> filed for chapter n protection in <unk> and has also announced its intention to sell its <unk> <unk> <unk> department store chain
<unk> <unk> is owned by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which itself is currently being managed by a court - appointed provisional liquidator
<unk> <unk> planned sale of <unk> is subject to approval by <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>
rumors to the effect that the <unk> chain would file for chapter n arose last week in the jewelry industry
at that time <unk> <unk> president of the chain angrily denied that his company was about to file
<unk> <unk> is leading the buy - out
according to executives close to the situation <unk> filed for chapter n to speed the sale of the chain
one executive said n an accord signed by the unsecured creditors of <unk> <unk> <unk> had frozen in place all of <unk> <unk> assets
the <unk> bankruptcy - law filing appears to supersede that agreement
by filing for chapter n the <unk> chain will only need approval from a bankruptcy judge for the sale not the hundreds of unsecured creditors said this executive
the cash from the sale will go to <unk> <unk> but the company itself will belong to <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> chief executive of <unk> <unk> were unavailable for comment
in a statement <unk> <unk> described the filing as a legal technicality but also said that our inability to obtain trade credit combined with a need to ensure that our stores were properly stocked for the <unk> season necessitated our filing chapter n
the jewelry chain which is based in <unk> <unk> had revenue of n million and operating profit of n million for the year ended <unk> <unk>
for all of this year explosive run - up in stock prices <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> computer sat on the sidelines
now it on the fence
<unk> a <unk> - based money manager began buying stocks again this week with half of the <unk> billion that it oversees for clients according to people familiar with the firm revised strategy
it was the first time since <unk> that <unk> has thought <unk> stocks are worth owning
<unk> declined to confirm the move but its stock purchases were thought to have begun <unk> timed to coincide with the maturity this week of <unk> bills owned by the firm
the other half of its portfolio is expected to remain invested in <unk> bills for the time being
<unk> <unk> executives said n they believed that <unk> <unk> million buy program was carried out by <unk> <unk>
as reported <unk> bought shares <unk> as part of a customer strategy shift although the broker client was said then to have been japanese
yesterday <unk> declined comment
when it owns stocks <unk> portfolio typically is composed of about <unk> large - capitalization issues to make buy or sell moves the firm solicits <unk> <unk> brokerage houses a day or so in advance looking for the best package price to carry out the trades
the broker winning the business does n't charge commissions but instead profits by buying or selling for less than the overall package price
that puts the broker at risk if it trying to buy stock in a rising market
in <unk> gyrating session the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> fell by n points early in the day but finished with less than a four - point loss
<unk> last portfolio shift carried out by <unk> <unk> <unk> was a highly publicized decision last <unk> to sell its entire stock portfolio and buy <unk> bills
the sell signal which sent a bearish chill through the stock market came when <unk> computer found that stocks were overpriced compared with bonds and <unk> bills
at the time the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> stood at about <unk>
the <unk> average now stands more than n higher while <unk> portfolio of treasurys produced a return of about <unk> through the first three quarters of the year
the computer miscalculation has been painful for <unk>
almost any money manager holding stocks has turned in better results while <unk> has played it safe with <unk> bills
so why does <unk> computer like stocks with the <unk> at <unk> where it closed yesterday when it did n't with the <unk> at <unk>
with the decline in stock prices and continued low or stable interest rates stocks are representing a better value all the time <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said yesterday
three - month <unk> - bill yields have fallen to <unk> from about <unk> at the start of the year
stock prices meanwhile are about <unk> points lower than the peak of <unk> reached on the <unk> industrial average <unk> n
are those declines enough to signal a partial return to stocks
<unk> <unk> wo n't say specifically explaining that if there was such a move it would take about three days to complete the loose ends of the transaction
during that time a buyer with the clout of a <unk> could end up driving up the price of stocks n it was trying to buy if it tipped its hand
but everything is relative to <unk> <unk> so stocks in his view can become more attractive in comparison with bonds or t - bills even if shares are more expensive than when they were sold in <unk>
our computer model has a certain trigger point he said
when the computer says switch <unk> switches
the firm has made <unk> previous shifts from one type of asset to another in its n history
almost all have involved at least half and often the firm entire portfolio as the computer searches for the most undervalued investment category following a money - management style called tactical asset allocation
competing asset - allocation firms march to their own computer models so some have been partly or fully invested in stocks this year while <unk> has sat on the sidelines
as a result competitors say <unk> <unk> has been looking for any opportunity to return to the stock market rather than risk losing business by continuing to remain fully invested in <unk> bills

the <unk> n <unk> <unk> column advises readers to charge with caution when traveling abroad because credit - card companies charge <unk> to convert foreign - currency expenditures into dollars
in fact this is the best bargain available to someone traveling abroad
in contrast to the <unk> conversion fee charged by <unk> foreign - currency dealers routinely charge n or more to convert <unk> dollars into foreign currency
on top of this the traveler who converts his dollars into foreign currency before the trip starts will lose interest from the day of conversion
at the end of the trip any unspent foreign exchange will have to be converted back into dollars with another commission due
the card holder will pay the modest <unk> fee only on the amounts actually needed

of the total purchase price n million cash and n million in stock nearly n million shares would be paid to buy the existing <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> a <unk> limited partnership
the remaining properties <unk> to be acquired are the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a facility jointly owned by <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the <unk> family and a small parcel owned by <unk> <unk> director <unk> <unk> <unk>
the purchase price was disclosed in a preliminary prospectus issued in connection with <unk> <unk> planned offering of six million common shares
the luxury airline and casino company n by investor <unk> <unk> and his <unk> <unk> earlier this month announced its agreements to acquire the properties but did n't disclose the purchase price
the proposed stock offering and issuance of nearly n million common shares in connection with the land purchase will bring <unk> <unk> total shares outstanding to n million of which <unk> will be owned by <unk> <unk> and <unk> according to the prospectus
in over - the-counter trading <unk> <unk> was bid at <unk> a share
proceeds from the offering are expected to be used for remodeling the company <unk> <unk> resort in <unk> <unk> refurbishing certain aircraft of the <unk> <unk> <unk> unit and to acquire the property for the new resort
the company said n it estimates n the <unk> <unk> remodeling will cost about n million and <unk> the refurbishment of the three n aircraft made by <unk> <unk> <unk> will cost around n million
<unk> <unk> said <unk> the latest stock offering wo n't cover the n million or more cost of building the proposed resort and theme park and added n it will need to seek additional financing either through bank borrowings or debt and equity offerings at a later date
construction is set to begin in early n
the resort will include the <unk> <unk> <unk> a multi - spired castle - like facility that will include <unk> rooms and <unk> square feet of casino space

investors poured <unk> billion more into money - market mutual funds in the latest week despite further declines in yields
assets of the n taxable funds tracked by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> jumped to n billion in the week ended <unk> the <unk> <unk> newsletter said <unk>
assets soared <unk> billion in the previous week
meanwhile the average yield on taxable funds dropped nearly a tenth of a percentage point the largest drop since midsummer
the average seven - day compound yield which assumes that dividends are reinvested and that current rates continue for a year fell to <unk> its lowest since late last year from <unk> the week before according to <unk>
lower yields are just reflecting lower short - term interest rates said <unk> <unk> <unk> editor of <unk> <unk> <unk>
money funds invest in such things as short - term <unk> securities commercial paper and certificates of deposit all of which have been posting lower interest rates since last spring
individual investors can still get better yields on money funds than on many other short - term instruments
the yield on six - month <unk> bills sold at <unk> auction for example was just n
the average yield on six - month cds of <unk> or less at major banks was n in the week ended <unk> according to <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> information service
one way that money fund managers boost yields in a declining rate environment is by extending the maturities of their investments so they can earn the current higher rates for a longer period
the average maturity of the taxable funds that <unk> follows increased by two days in the latest week to n days its longest since <unk>
they anticipating further declines in rates and they going to get them slowly said <unk> <unk> chief economist for the <unk> <unk> publisher of <unk> <unk> <unk>
average maturity was as short as <unk> days at the start of this year when short - term interest rates were moving steadily upward
the average seven - day compound yield of the funds reached n in late <unk>
the highest - yielding funds are still above n
the top - performing fund in the latest week was <unk> <unk> <unk> with a seven - day compound yield of <unk>
the fund invests heavily in dollar - denominated money - market securities overseas
it is currently waiving management fees which contributes to the higher yield
the average seven - day simple yield of the <unk> funds fell to <unk> from <unk> <unk> reported <unk>
the average <unk> simple yield slid to <unk> from <unk> and the average n compound yield fell to <unk> from <unk>
many small investors are facing a double whammy this year they got hurt by investing in the highly risky junk bond market and the pain is worse because they did it with borrowed money
these people invested in leveraged junk bond mutual funds the publicly traded funds that make a habit of taking out loans to buy extra junk
it a good strategy in a rising market where a <unk> leveraged portfolio in effect allows investors to have n of their money working for them
the strategy boosts current yield by putting more bonds into the portfolio
trouble is n junk bond prices have been weak for months
thus the leverage has amplified the funds portfolio losses
and shares of leveraged junk funds this year have been clobbered even harder than the junk bonds n they hold
that really where the leverage hurt says <unk> <unk> a <unk> - based investment manager who specializes in closed - end funds
share prices performed even worse than the funds asset values because fear has taken hold in the junk market he says n
leverage is never a problem for the traditional open end mutual funds which are n't publicly traded and are n't allowed to use leverage at all
leverage is used only by some of the closed - end funds
the usual maneuver is to borrow against the portfolio value or issue preferred stock using the proceeds to buy additional bonds
the fallout for investors lately has been painful
consider the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
with a leveraged position of about <unk> the fund share price has plunged <unk> so far this year
that worse than the price drop sustained by the bonds in its portfolio whose total return bond - price changes plus interest has amounted to a negative n
such problems may not be over
leveraged funds in particular are still extremely vulnerable because we still at the beginning of problems in the junk market says <unk> <unk> <unk> a managing partner at <unk> <unk> associates in <unk> <unk>
many investors are unaware n their funds have borrowed to speculate in such a risky market
if someone actually sat down and thought about what they were being sold says <unk> <unk> editor of the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> they might shy away
in a typical leverage strategy a fund tries to capture the spread between what it costs to borrow and the higher return on the bonds n it buys with the borrowed money
if the market surges holders can make that much more profit the leverage effectively acts as an interest - free margin account for investors
but when the market moves against the fund investors lose more than other junk holders because the market decline is magnified by the amount n the fund is leveraged
fund managers for their part defend their use of leverage
<unk> <unk> who runs the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> says <unk> the fund n leverage has jacked up its interest income
as long as i am borrowing at <unk> and each bond yields over that it enhances the yield he maintains
<unk> <unk> says <unk> he tries to offset the leverage by diversifying the fund portfolio
yet some funds have pulled in their horns
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> recently said that it plans to reduce its leverage position by buying back n million in preferred stock and notes from investors
the fund made a similar move earlier this year
we are trying to increase our flexibility says <unk> <unk> <unk> a vice president at <unk> <unk> <unk> the fund investment adviser
she declined to elaborate and would n't disclose the fund recent purchases sales or cash position
<unk> <unk> did say n the fund recent performance illustrates what happens in a leveraged product when the market does n't cooperate
when the market turns around she says n it will give a nice picture of how leverage can help performance
several leveraged funds do n't want to cut the amount n they borrow because it would slash the income n they pay shareholders fund officials said n
but a few funds have taken other defensive steps
some have raised their cash positions to record levels
high cash positions help buffer a fund when the market falls
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for instance now holds about <unk> in cash and equivalents nearly quintuple the amount n it held earlier this year says <unk> <unk> <unk> portfolio co - manager
he says <unk> the fund which is n leveraged has maintained a substantial cushion between its borrowing costs and the yields of the portfolio bonds
i do n't want to be in a position n to have to sell <unk> <unk> says
other funds have recently sold weak junk bonds to raise cash
at the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> portfolio manager <unk> <unk> recently dumped <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> industries among others to raise his cash position to a record n
that a problem because cash is n't earning us very much money <unk> <unk> says
he concedes this is the most difficult market that i been involved in
because of the recent junk - market turmoil the fund is considering investing in other issues instead including mortgage - backed bonds
we looking at the leverage factor every day says <unk> <unk> president of <unk> - <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> unit and the fund adviser
at some point if we are unable to cover our leveraged cost and at the moment we right on it we going to have to make a move
one of the more bizarre garden stories since <unk> has been unfolding for four years now in the private paper - and-crayon fantasies of artist <unk> <unk>
and if she and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> have their way her horticulturally inept plan will soon go public as a real garden artwork in the downtown complex
<unk> gardens <unk> as the <unk> scheme is called will occupy the last n acres of open space at the southwest tip of <unk>
it could cost taxpayers n million to install and <unk> residents n million a year to maintain
created by an artist who flaunts her ignorance of plants and gardens <unk> gardens as now planned will die from congestive garden design
<unk> <unk> previous work which earned her an international reputation in the non - horticultural art world often took gardens as its nominal subject
<unk> this metaphorical connection made the <unk> <unk> arts <unk> think <unk> she had a literal green thumb
<unk> <unk> would not discuss her garden for this article
last year she boasted to <unk> magazine i never looked at a garden in my life
and she proved no shirking violet in her initial statement to the <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> public benefit corporation the only thing <unk> i was interested in doing was a very complicated garden which would cost an enormous amount of money and be very expensive n to maintain
undeterred the <unk> hired <unk> <unk> and another confessed garden ignoramus the architect <unk> <unk> who claimed n he had never visited much less built a garden and said of the project i do n't view this as a landscape
i view this as a building
the third principal in the <unk> gardens adventure did have garden experience
the firm of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> architects had created <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
the <unk> called its team a stunning collaboration
after four years though the <unk> gardens design is <unk> uncollaborated <unk> <unk>
she has done little more than recycle her standard motifs trees water landscape fragments rudimentary square houses circles triangles rectangles and fit them into a grid as if she were making one of her gridded two - dimensional works for a gallery wall
but for <unk> gardens the grid was to be a <unk> network of masonry or hedge walls with real plants inside them
in a letter to the <unk> <unk> called this arbitrary and amateurish
the landscape architects were expelled from the garden in <unk>
all the while <unk> <unk> had been busy at her assignment serene in her sense of self - tilth
as she put it in a n lecture at the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> i have designed a garden not knowing the difference between a rhododendron and a tulip
moreover she proclaimed that landscape architects have been going wrong for the last n years in the design of open space
and she further stunned her listeners by revealing her secret garden design method commissioning a friend to spend five or six thousand dollars on books that i ultimately cut up
after that the layout had been easy
i always relied heavily on the grid and found it never to fail
<unk> <unk> told her audience that she absolutely did not believe in compromise or in giving in to the client because i do n't think n you can do watered - down versions of things
this was never a problem with <unk> gardens because the client had long since given in to <unk> <unk> every whim
last year the public was afforded a preview of <unk> <unk> creation in a tablemodel version at a <unk> exhibition
the labels were breathy within its sheltering walls is a microcosm of a thousand years in garden design a rose garden herb garden serpentine garden flower fields an apple orchard organized in a patchwork of <unk> squares to form rooms here and there are simple architectural forms a whimsical jet of water a conceit of topiary or tartan plaid and chairs of every sort n to drag around
at the core of it all is a love for plants
plant lovers who studied the maquette were alarmed
they looked at the miniature and saw a giant folly
<unk> <unk> little rooms left little room for plants or people
<unk> had put <unk> gardens carrying capacity at four people per room or about <unk> humans overall
this mincemeat of tiny gridlocked squares was inspired by the artist own digs my loft was <unk> by n feet so n feet by <unk> feet seemed like a good garden room
inside the grid were <unk> of these plant cells jammed full of clutter
one she made into a topiary rec room replete with plants shaped into a <unk> <unk> piano and chairs
in another she requisitioned topiary <unk> missile cones costing n each in heights up to n feet
another she stuffed with eight rectilinear hedges for a topiary geometry lesson in the right - angling of plants
in the herbal lounge she specified a plaid knot garden decor
she ordered the foyer done in a different plaid planting and made the landscape architects study a book on tartans
in one garden roomette she implanted a <unk> square glass cube meant to show off a plaid tile floor conceit a zinc sink a huge fishbowl with carp and a birdcage with cockatoos
next door she put a smaller plaid - floored glass house where she suggested n a flat of strawberries might be displayed in the dead of winter
in another compartment called the <unk> <unk> <unk> linden trees were to be crowded together at killing intervals of <unk> or <unk> feet
lindens need about <unk> feet
one thing about the <unk> plan was never in doubt it would demand the full - time skills of a battalion of topiary barbers rosarians orchardists and arborists
<unk> <unk> blithely suggested calling upon semi - skilled garden club workers for maintenance
furthermore she had insisted on paths so narrow five to eight feet and hedge corners so square that standard maintenance equipment trucks or cherry pickers could n't maneuver
then to make these gardenettes quite literally rooms <unk> <unk> had thrown up windowless walls brick lattice hedge eight to n feet tall casting her interiors into day - long stygian shade
it was hard to see how photosynthesis would ever happen in <unk> gardens without decking the walls in a <unk> - like array of <unk> - lites
finally flouting the <unk> wishes to continue the popular two - mile riverside <unk> prized for its expansive views of <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> threw up yet another wall this time concrete this time <unk> <unk> feet tall
she ran it the length of the <unk> gardens riverfront blotting out the city great natural water features the harbor and the river
within her garden she has decreed a waterfall a rill ponds and other costly trivial waterworks beside the <unk>
while the model was still on view <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> passed a resolution against <unk> gardens
the parks <unk> wrote the <unk> that this too private exclusive complex and expensive enclosed garden belongs in almost any location but the waterfront
<unk> <unk> <unk> the noted public garden designer who restored <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> recalls her reaction to the <unk> gardens model in light of the public garden n she was designing for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as designed in <unk> failed as a public space because it made people feel trapped
by removing the hedges and some walls the <unk> <unk> <unk> is opening it up
it seems to me n the <unk> plan has the potential of making <unk> gardens a horticultural jail for people and plants
the three urban horticulture experts with <unk> <unk> <unk> weighed in with a letter to the <unk> that began we feel that the garden is horticulturally doomed
they then addressed the decidedly questionable safety of a complex garden of endless hiding places
the <unk> ft . hedges which obstruct views in and out of small rooms insure that this garden will be a potential breeding ground for crime
at <unk> <unk> <unk> had declared there are going to be problems with safety
i not going to address questions of safety
despite the dire assessments of knowledgeable garden professionals <unk> <unk> <unk> gardens design somehow continues on seemingly impervious to reason stalled only by bureaucratic lethargy and logistical complications
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> hopes to negotiate a seawall that could be significantly more visually permeable
and by substituting yet another landscape architect <unk> <unk> he insists n he can achieve that and other accommodations to gardening reality while still preserving the artistic vision of a truly great artist
after four years of no progress in this direction it is doubtful n any viable collaboration with <unk> <unk> will suddenly now be possible
<unk> <unk> has said <unk> he plans to go with the grid regardless
there is still time however n for <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> chairman of the <unk> board to prevent this topiary <unk> <unk>
these statesmen might take counsel from <unk> <unk> author of the <unk> <unk> <unk> the gardener bible since <unk> who seems to have had a <unk> <unk> in mind when he wrote <unk> our gardeners for ages have suffered at the hands of the decorative artist when applying his designs to the garden
it is this adapting of absurd knots and patterns from old books to any surface where a flower garden has to be made that leads to bad and frivolous design wrong in plan and hopeless for the life of plants
i read the exerpts of <unk> <unk> exchange with a <unk> representative put the soviet <unk> on <unk> rails editorial page <unk> n with great interest since the gold standard is one of my areas of research
<unk> <unk> is incorrect when he states that the <unk> <unk> large gold reserves would give it great power to establish credibility
during the latter part of the <unk> century <unk> was on a gold standard and had gold reserves representing more than n of its outstanding currency but no one outside <unk> used rubles
the <unk> of <unk> on the other hand had gold reserves that averaged about <unk> of its outstanding currency and <unk> of <unk> notes were accepted throughout the world
the most likely reason for this disparity is that the <unk> of <unk> was a private bank with substantial earning assets and the common - law rights of creditors to collect claims against the bank were well established in <unk>
by contrast in <unk> <unk> an authoritarian government owned the bank and had the power to revoke payment whenever it chose much as it would in today <unk> <unk>
the success of the british gold standard was due to independent private banking and common law rather than the choice of gold for valuing the currency
it is no coincidence that from <unk> to <unk> when the <unk> of <unk> was an independent private bank the pound was never devalued and payment of gold for pound notes was never suspended but with the subsequent nationalization of the <unk> of <unk> the pound was devalued with increasing frequency and its use as an international medium of exchange declined
the <unk> <unk> should keep these lessons in mind as it seeks to establish the ruble as an international currency
one way <unk> to make the ruble into a major international currency would be to leave reserves of gold and earning assets in a swiss bank with distributions based on <unk> laws
unless the laws determining the noteholder rights to payment are independent of the issuer of those notes however a gold - based ruble would be as unsuccessful for the soviets as it was for the czars

after the study the <unk> would be willing to consider adding new circuit breakers or fine - tuning the current ones he added n
circuit breakers designed to give the markets a breather in cases of sharp price movements curb trading of futures or stocks at various trigger points

<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman of the <unk> telecommunications and <unk> <unk> is pushing the idea of a circuit breaker for computer - driven program trading in hopes <unk> that would curb turmoil in the marketplace
he argued that program - trading by roughly <unk> big institutions is pushing around the markets and scaring individual investors
<unk> <unk> did n't reject the proposal
after the <unk> study of the drop is completed he said n i perfectly happy to work with this committee in identifying whether we need other devices such as a program - trading curb
<unk> <unk> backed most of the provisions in a market - reform bill that the <unk> brought to the subcommittee last year under then - chairman <unk> <unk>
the measure is expected to move through this <unk>
but the new chairman vehemently opposed a provision in the bill that would give the agency the right to close the markets at times of stress
<unk> <unk> contended that uncertainty over when the <unk> might act could worsen volatility in the markets
he argued that the current circuit - breaker system allows investors to know precisely when and where any trading interruptions will occur and how long they will last
<unk> <unk> offered strong support for two other provisions in the bill
one would force brokerage houses to provide the <unk> detailed information about loans made by their holding companies
such loans often are used to finance leveraged buy - outs and the agency is worried that a sharp market drop could create capital problems for the firms
he also backed a rule <unk> to require large traders to report transactions on a systematic basis
that information he argued <unk> is critical to reconstructing sharp market moves such as the one nearly two weeks ago
in a rare package sale of its real estate <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has sold <unk> of its strip shopping centers to a limited partnership led by <unk> <unk> developer <unk> <unk> according to sources familiar with the transaction
they estimate the value of the transaction at close to n million
<unk> <unk> officials and <unk> <unk> would n't comment on the sale
<unk> <unk> previously had announced n it would report its third consecutive decline in quarterly earnings for the period ended yesterday the same day n the real estate deal was completed
analysts are estimating <unk> third - quarter earnings will drop between <unk> and <unk> to about <unk> to n cents per share compared with n cents per share in the year - ago quarter
it is unclear what effect the sale of the shopping centers will have on earnings
<unk> <unk> developed the centers which range in size from about <unk> square feet to just over <unk> square feet
most are anchored by a <unk> <unk> store
the retailer reportedly will lease its stores back from the developer who plans to expand the small centers

<unk> is fighting back against junk mail
so much of the stuff poured into its <unk> <unk> offices that its mail rooms there simply stopped delivering it
now thousands of mailers catalogs and sales pitches go straight into the trash
we just do n't have the staff n to deliver it nor do we have the space or the time says a spokesman for the <unk> <unk> electronics company which has n employees in the <unk> area
it the overload problem and the weight problem n we have
<unk> is in good company
businesses across the country are getting fed up with junk mail and some are saying n they just are n't going to take it anymore literally
while no one has tracked how many company mail rooms throw out junk mail direct - mail advertising firms say n the number is growing
<unk> motors earlier this year said n it would n't deliver bulk mail or free magazines in its <unk> <unk> office while <unk> products chemicals <unk> <unk> says <unk> it screens junk mail and often throws out most of a given mass mailing
why the revolt
anybody with a mailbox can answer that sheer overwhelming mind - numbing volume
according to the <unk> <unk> <unk> total direct mail to both businesses and consumers jumped <unk> to n billion pieces in n from five years earlier
though direct mail to businesses is n't broken out separately the association says <unk> it growing even faster
the deluge has spurred cost - conscious companies to action with mail rooms throwing the stuff out rather than taking the time or money to deliver it
the direct - mail industry not surprisingly is fuming at the injustice of it all
after all this is the industry that has a hard enough time getting any respect that is the butt of so many jokes that television <unk> <unk> portrays direct - mail-mogul <unk> as short bald intensely nerdy and unremittingly boring
the practice of businesses throwing out junk mail is a commonly known problem and it increasing as companies attempt to put through budget cuts across the board right down to the mail - room level says <unk> <unk> <unk> a list consultant and chairman of the <unk> <unk> <unk> business - to-business council
but it like biting the hand that feeds them because every one of these companies uses direct marketing
it almost impossible to track the number of companies trashing junk mail since the decision is usually made in the mail room not the board room
and the practice often varies from location to location even within a company
but industry executives say n businesses seem especially inclined to dump mailers sent to titles rather than to individual names
<unk> <unk> operation was one of the first n to lose patience deciding a few years ago to junk any bulk mail that was n't addressed to an individual
magazines are n't delivered at all even if an individual name is listed employees who want their magazines have to pick them up from the mail room or the company library and are told to change the subscriptions to their home addresses
at <unk> products meanwhile the mailroom staff opens junk mail and often throws it away even if addressed to an individual
if they get n packets of something they open one see what it says throw n away and send two to people or departments n they think are appropriate a spokesman says
direct marketers were especially alarmed when <unk> motors one of the country largest companies and a big direct - mail user itself entered the junk - mail battle
as of <unk> <unk> its <unk> office with about n employees stopped delivering bulk mail and non - subscription magazines
employees were told that if they really wanted the publications they would have to have them sent home instead
the reason overload especially of non - subscription magazines
direct - mail executives see <unk> stand as an ominous sign even if the junk - mail kings did bring it on themselves
why anyone would want to close themselves off from direct mail a priori does n't make any sense says <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> associates a <unk> directmail firm
it smacks of big brotherism
they going to decide what their employees can or can not read

<unk> democrats who favor cutting the capital - gains tax are n't ready to line up behind the leading <unk> proposal
their reluctance to support the proposal is another blow to the capital - gains cut which has had a roller - coaster existence since the beginning of the year when it was considered dead and then suddenly revived and was passed by the <unk>
nevertheless <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the ranking <unk> member on the tax - writing <unk> <unk> <unk> last night introduced his plan as an amendment to a pending measure authorizing <unk> aid for <unk> and <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was confident <unk> he had enough votes to block the maneuver on procedural grounds perhaps as soon as today
<unk> <unk> all but conceded defeat telling <unk> <unk> i sense at this stage n you may have the votes
the two lawmakers sparred in a highly personal fashion violating usual <unk> decorum
their tone was good - natured with <unk> <unk> saying n he intended to offer the proposal again and again on future legislation and <unk> <unk> saying <unk> he intended to use procedural means to block it again and again
although the proposal authored by <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> appears to have general backing by republicans their votes are n't sufficient to pass it
and democrats who are under increasing pressure from their leaders to reject the gains - tax cut are finding reasons to say no at least for now
a major reason is that they believe n the <unk> - <unk> plan would lose buckets of revenue over the long run
the <unk> - <unk> proposal would reduce the tax depending on how long an asset was held
it also would create a new individual retirement account that would shield from taxation the appreciation on investments made for a wide variety of purposes including retirement medical expenses first - home purchases and tuition
a number of us are not going to touch capital gains iras or anything else unless it contributes to deficit - reduction said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who is one of the <unk> to <unk> democrats who the <unk> administration believes <unk> might favor giving preferential treatment to capital gains
<unk> <unk> has been hearing this kind of opposition first hand during meetings over the past two days with democratic senators at the <unk> <unk>
and at a luncheon meeting <unk> of democratic senators there was outspoken opposition to cutting the capital - gains tax this year according to participants
the trend is making advocates of the tax cut less optimistic about success
there is a one - out-of-three shot of getting it this year said <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> a leading democratic proponent of cutting the capital - gains tax
he called the battle uphill
other democrats who favor a capital - gains cut are even more pessimistic
there will be no capital - gains bill this year said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
i probably not going to vote for any capital - gains proposal
the <unk> portion of the <unk> - <unk> plan is irresponsible
another significant factor in the capitalgains debate is the extent to which it has become a purely political battle between <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> has made clear to his wavering colleagues that the issue is important to him personally
today <unk> <unk> and other leading democrats plan to turn up the heat again by holding a news conference to bash the proposal
estimates requested by <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> show that the richest n taxpayers got an average benefit from the capital - gains differential of n million each in <unk> the last year for which figures are available
<unk> <unk> officials acknowledged yesterday that democrats still are reluctant to publicly express support for the <unk> - <unk> capital gains proposal because they are loath to buck <unk> <unk>
as a result the officials said n they are open to making a variety of deals with <unk> democrats to win their support for a capital - gains tax cut
democrats asked in this week for discussions with <unk> <unk> have suggested ways of tinkering with the <unk> - <unk> proposal suggesting an interest in looking for a modified version n they can back one official said <unk>
in addition <unk> <unk> aides think that there are numerous other important measures <unk> democrats badly wanted passed such as the scaling back of a controversial catastrophic health - care plan for the elderly that might provide the president leverage in cutting deals with democrats
a capital - gains tax cut might be paired with such measures to help ensure passage
other possibilities include a child - care initiative and an increase in the minimum wage
if they ca n't secure immediate passage of a capital - gains plan administration officials also are n't ruling out making a deal with <unk> to put off a vote until a firm date in the future even next year
but the officials insist that such a deal on a future vote would have to apply to both the <unk> and the <unk>

they contend <unk> it is based on an assumption that has not yet been proven in valid tests the <unk> said
in <unk> some institute patients were reporting breakthrough seizures when they were switched from a specific brand - name medication to a generic one or from one generic manufacturer of a specific product to another
in addition neurologists were beginning to report these observations as well
call it anecdotal if you will
but no ethical physician would switch patients who were doing well on a specific medication from a specific manufacturer to prove a point
we do not depend on pharmaceutical companies for our support
the institute has governmental service contracts for the provision of direct patient services collects patient fees receives money through contributions from individuals foundations and bequests
the funds received from pharmaceutical firms are used to offset physician symposiums and these symposiums do not stress any particular medication or manufacturer
the <unk> <unk> reporting of breakthrough seizures stemmed from concerns about the people n we treat and care about daily
this perhaps was perceived as a bold stance and thus suspicious
but let us not confuse profits of big business masquerading as concerns for people health care or for the cost
for whom is the saving
surely not to people with epilepsy who depend on the same levels of medication in their bloodstream daily to maintain seizure control

the harder question is whether anyone yet understands that <unk> <unk> fight for his constitutional prerogatives is about politics as much as it is about law

the <unk> <unk> warned that this would be an unconstitutional usurpation of its power
when it threatened to use this provision as the test for a line - item veto <unk> caved
the fear <unk> <unk> has of any line - item-veto test led members to add the single most contorted and ridiculous provision this year this section shall be effective only on <unk> n <unk>

several big securities firms backed off from program trading a few months after the <unk> crash
but most of them led by <unk> <unk> <unk> moved back in earlier this year
the most volatile form of program trading is index arbitrage the rapid - fire computer - guided buying and selling of stocks offset with opposite trades in stock - index futures and options
the object is to capture profits from fleeting price discrepancies between the futures and options and the stocks themselves
index arbitrage recently has accounted for about half of all program trading on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>

index arbitrage does n't work and it scares natural buyers of stock
while <unk> <unk> explained <unk> he not totally convinced <unk> index arbitrage changes the overall level of the stock market he said that on an intraday basis it has major effects

he said n the market volatility disturbs him but that all <unk> the exchange can do is slow down the process by using its circuit breakers and shock absorbers

this is no longer true because of <unk> massive debt load
it all <unk> anybody wants to talk about says <unk> <unk> executive vice president for <unk> <unk> <unk> a leading credit service
people wonder what going to happen next
many manufacturers are worried about being paid for merchandise already shipped to <unk> stores
but those dollars at risk pale in comparison to the investment required to make and ship spring goods to <unk> stores

i buying fabric right now for clothes which i may not be paid for until <unk> or <unk>
what happens to me if <unk> collapses between now and then
some credit concerns such as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> have told clients not to ship anything to <unk> or <unk> stores on credit
this is especially true for spring merchandise says <unk> <unk> credit manager at <unk> <unk>
<unk> has too much debt
other credit houses such as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are suggesting that their clients study each order before shipping
payments are good right now but we are n't recommending any long - term lines of credit says <unk> <unk> a retail credit analyst referring to credit lines which make inventory purchases automatic
the <unk> situation is a little uncertain and very difficult n to analyze
because of those concerns some manufacturers say n they will ask for letters of credit before shipping spring merchandise

we expect <unk> they will be current with their debts by the end of the week but we are considering asking them for letters of credit before we take more orders

business has never been this tough before
not only does your product have to be excellent but you also have to be able to collect

<unk> <unk> <unk> hammered by higher costs and lower shipments to key automotive and service - center customers posted a n drop in third - quarter profit
separately two more of the nation top steelmakers <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> reported lower operating earnings in their steel businesses marking what is generally believed to be the end of a two - year boom in the industry
<unk> <unk> analysts expect the disappointing trend to continue into the fourth quarter and through at least the first two quarters of <unk> when the industry will increasingly see the effect of price erosion in major product lines such as rolled sheet used for cars appliances and construction
it does n't bode well for coming quarters said <unk> <unk> who follows the steel industry for <unk> <unk>
in fact he thinks n several steelmakers will report actual losses through the third quarter of <unk>
bethlehem the nation second largest steelmaker earned n million or n cents a share
the figures include n million in costs related to a blast furnace outage and n million in losses from unauthorized work outages at the company coal operations
in the year - ago period <unk> earned n million or <unk> a share including a n million gain from early retirement of debt
third - quarter sales dropped <unk> to n billion from n billion a year ago
in composite trading on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> shares rose n cents to <unk>
of all the major steelmakers <unk> would seem to be the most vulnerable to a slowdown
it has n't diversified beyond steel nor has it linked up with a joint venture partner to share costs and risks
however in spite of the difficult industrywide environment of high cost and low volume <unk> had pretty good earnings numbers said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> had estimated third - quarter earnings of n cents a share but said <unk> the losses for the unusual items were larger than expected
still <unk> core basic steel operations experienced a steep drop in operating profit to n million from n million a year ago when the industry enjoyed strong demand and pricing
the company said <unk> its shipments declined as a result of a reduction in inventories by service centers a lackluster automotive market and increasing competitive pressures in the construction market
at the same time production costs compared with a year ago were boosted by higher raw material and employment costs which resulted from the company new labor pact effective <unk> n
we anticipate that steel market conditions will exhibit a further moderate decline in the fourth quarter as the automotive sector remains weak and customers continue to adjust inventories said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
he noted however that the company order entry has increased from the low levels of the early summer following the end of labor negotiations
<unk> hampered by lower volume in its specialty steel business said <unk> third - quarter net income dropped <unk> to n million or n cents a share from n million or n cents a share in the year - ago quarter
sales dropped to n million from n million because the company no longer consolidates its <unk> <unk> division which is now a joint venture with <unk> <unk> <unk>
along with reduced volume analysts said n the nation fifth largest steelmaker was hurt by holding higher - cost inventory when raw material costs of such key products as nickel dropped
operating profit dropped <unk> in its specialty flat - rolled steel segment
moreover the company said <unk> higher sales and shipments to service centers from its <unk> <unk> <unk> joint venture failed to offset weakness in the automotive market higher production costs and a poorer product mix
<unk> shares closed unchanged at <unk> in composite trading on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> which owns n of the nation sixth largest steelmaker <unk> <unk> <unk> posted net income for the fiscal second - quarter of n million or n cents a share compared with a net loss of n million
sales increased in the quarter ended <unk> <unk> to n million from n million a year ago
the latest period includes gains of n million from early retirement of debt and tax loss carry - forward

<unk> <unk> stock closed at <unk> unchanged in composite trading on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the company noted that its <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> stores <unk> and <unk> <unk> operations showed improvements as a result of restructuring moves

<unk> <unk> machines <unk> said <unk> it agreed to let <unk> <unk> participate in a semiconductor research project as part of its effort to bolster the <unk> semiconductor industry
<unk> which made the announcement at the dedication of a research center here said n it invited many other companies to participate as well including some from <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> president said <unk> <unk> is also considering letting other companies participate in additional semiconductor work but declined to be more specific
<unk> which said a year ago <unk> it was inviting companies to participate in some semiconductor work has become far more open about its technology as it has tried to rally <unk> industry to head off the japanese who now dominate the market for dynamic random access memory chips
while <unk> <unk> <unk> makes the bulk of the <unk> <unk> it uses it does n't make the equipment needed to produce those chips
and <unk> worries that the japanese will take over that equipment market too unless <unk> semiconductor companies produce enough memory chips here n to keep <unk> equipment makers healthy
failure of <unk> equipment makers <unk> fears n would leave it dependent on many of the japanese companies that compete with it in other parts of the market
<unk> also said n it expects to benefit from the expertise that <unk> and other companies can bring to bear on the difficult problems involved in semiconductor manufacturing
<unk> already participates in one industrywide effort to improve semiconductor - manufacturing techniques
<unk> said n it expects industrywide efforts to become prevalent because semiconductor manufacturing has become so expensive
a state - of-the-art plant cost n million in the <unk> but costs n million today because the technology is so complex
and <unk> said n it expects the costs to continue climbing
<unk> which said <unk> <unk> is paying just a nominal fee to cover the n agreement acknowledged n some companies had turned down its invitation to join in
but it said <unk> that was mainly because the project may not bear fruit until the n
<unk> said n it thought n more companies would become interested as the project progresses
the project involving <unk> concerns a technique called <unk> - ray lithography that figures to be crucial to future generations of memory chips
currently chips are produced by shining light through a mask to produce an image on the chip much as a camera produces an image on film
but details on chips must now be extraordinarily fine and the wavelengths of even ultraviolet light are long enough so that the images n they draw may be too blurry much as someone using a wide paintbrush could produce a broad line but would have trouble painting a thin one
x - rays by contrast travel straighter and can be focused more tightly than light
x - rays have problems too
they can make the masks brittle and can pass through material n they not supposed to
but assuming n those problems can be overcome they should allow for memory chips that could approach one billion bits of information n times as much as is contained in the four - megabit chips that are just reaching the market and a million times what was possible in the n

he added however that inflation could be brought down close to zero without throwing the economy into a recession
analysts viewed the chairman comments as an indication that the central bank is disinclined to ease monetary policy further in the near future
the dollar climbed immediately higher on news of <unk> <unk> testimony settling lower in later trade as dealers squared positions ahead of today preliminary report on third - quarter <unk> gross national product

sterling was quoted at <unk> up from <unk> late <unk>
in <unk> <unk> the <unk> currency opened for trading at <unk> yen up from <unk> <unk> close of <unk> yen
many traders forecast a continuation of the market recent bearish trend and predict <unk> the <unk> currency will remain stuck in its relatively narrow ranges in the near term and then shift lower
but according to <unk> <unk> a corporate trader with <unk> of <unk> in <unk> <unk> a large number of short positions must first be corrected spurring a temporary upswing before the unit can turn lower
he predicts a downward move in dollar - mark trade and a less dramatic slip in dollar - yen noting that there continues to be a large pool of japanese investor interest in <unk> securities which could provide a solid base for the dollar at around <unk> yen
market participants hope <unk> today <unk> report will offer more substantial evidence on <unk> economic growth although analysts are quick to point out that the figures may overstate the economy vigor
the r word is looming again says one dealer referring to persistent concern among some market analysts that the <unk> economy is heading toward a major slowdown if not a recession
some dealers note that while the third - quarter figures may appear relatively bullish the market consensus calls for a n annual growth rate unchanged from the second - quarter rate it would take a significantly stronger figure to alter market perceptions that the economy is softening
some analysts reckon that the next quarter figures will present a more accurate picture of the <unk> economy showing a marked slowdown in a number of sectors including housing starts and equities

a reinsurance company effectively insures insurance companies that wish to spread the risk of a particular policy
<unk> <unk> also owns <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> an insurance agency and brokerage
<unk> <unk> associates <unk> the closely held owner of <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> its fiscal third - quarter earnings jumped to n million from n million a year earlier aided by a n million gain from the sale of stock in a japanese subsidiary
the apparel holding company had sales in the quarter ended <unk> <unk> of n billion up <unk> from n million a year ago
the company said <unk> its quarterly results are now being publicly filed as the result of the formation earlier this year of employee stock investment plans
<unk> <unk> would like <unk> <unk> board to change its mind about keeping the company independent
but what happens next in the continuing takeover drama may depend more on the company two most powerful and fractious unions the pilots and machinists
some people familiar with the situation believe that the collapse of the previous <unk> billion buy - out if anything may have strengthened the hands of these two labor groups
as a result both may now have virtual veto power over any <unk> transaction
one reason banks likely to react to any new <unk> deal with even more caution than the first time around probably will insist on labor harmony before they agree to put up cash for any new bid or even a less - ambitious recapitalization plan
<unk> pilots have shown on a number of occasions n they are willing and able to strike said an executive at <unk> <unk> one of <unk> large lenders
if you have both labor groups on strike you got no revenue and that a very scary thing <unk> for a bank to be looking at
just this past week a leading japanese bank asked for a meeting with the machinists union leaders <unk> to determine where the union would stand if another bid or recapitalization became possible
another reason emboldened by their success in helping to scuttle the previous transaction the machinists are likely to be more aggressive if a second buy - out attempt occurs
the two unions already had significant leverage simply because their employer has yet to settle with either on new contracts
that gives them both the threat of a strike and the ability to resist any wage concessions that may be necessary to make a transaction work
thus even investors who are pushing for the board to do a recapitalization that would pay shareholders a special dividend and possibly grant employees an ownership stake acknowledge that the unions are key
there less likelihood of creating and completing a transaction without the unions cooperation and wage concessions said <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> takeover stock - trader
<unk> <unk> thinks <unk> the <unk> board should be ousted if it does n't move soon to increase shareholder value
both the pilots and machinists have made it clear that they intend to block any transaction n they do n't like
the pilots will be involved in any transaction that takes place around here pilot union chairman <unk> <unk> <unk> declared yesterday
but whether the pilots can team up with their longtime adversaries the machinists is another question
the pilots <unk> <unk> says <unk> his union would like majority ownership for employees
at the very least the pilots want some form of control over the airline perhaps through super - majority voting rights
on the other hand the machinists have always opposed majority ownership in principle saying n they do n't think n employees should be owners
still in recent days machinists union leaders have shown some new flexibility
we may be able to reach a tradeoff where we can accommodate the pilot union concerns and ours said <unk> <unk> <unk> the machinists financial adviser
<unk> <unk> said n machinists union advisers plan to meet this week to try to draw up a blueprint for some form of recapitalization that could include a special dividend for shareholders an employee stake and perhaps an equity investment by a friendly investor
if a compromise ca n't be reached the pilots maintain n they can do a transaction without the support of the machinists
but at this point that may just be wishful thinking
the machinists lobbied heavily against the original bid from <unk> pilots and management for the company
their opposition helped scare off some japanese banks
the pilots insistence on majority ownership also may make the idea of a recapitalization difficult n to achieve
who wants to be a public shareholder investing in a company controlled by the pilots union asks <unk> <unk> an analyst at <unk> <unk> <unk>
who would the board be working for the public shareholders or the pilots she adds
<unk> <unk> says <unk> she believes n a recapitalization involving employee ownership would succeed only if the pilots relent on their demand for control
she also notes that even if the pilots accept a minority stake now they still could come back at a later time and try to take control
another possibility is for the pilots to team up with an outside investor who might try to force the ouster of the board through the solicitation of consents
in that way the pilots may be able to force the board to approve a recapitalization that gives employees a majority stake or to consider the labor - management group latest proposal
the group did n't make a formal offer but instead told <unk> advisers before the most - recent board meeting that it was working on a bid valued at between <unk> and <unk> a share
but again they may need the help of the machinists
i think n the dynamics of this situation are that something got to happen said one official familiar with the situation
the board and <unk> management he says n ca n't go back to business as usual
the pilots wo n't let them
<unk> <unk> <unk> earnings soared n to a record in the fiscal first quarter bucking the industry trend toward declining profits
the <unk> - based airline the third largest in the <unk> attributed the increase to higher passenger traffic new international routes and reduced service by rival <unk> <unk> which is in bankruptcy proceedings in the wake of a strike that began last spring

during the quarter <unk> issued n million shares of common stock to <unk> and repurchased n million shares for use in a company employee stock ownership plan
the key to <unk> record earnings continued to be excellent passenger revenue growth said <unk> <unk> chief financial officer
passenger traffic jumped <unk> in the quarter while profit per passenger grew <unk>
<unk> has benefited more than other carriers from the weakness of <unk> <unk> which shares the <unk> hub
although <unk> is back to about <unk> of its pre - strike schedule now the <unk> <unk> <unk> subsidiary was only beginning to get back on its feet during the quarter
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> reported <unk> third - quarter profit jumped <unk> to n million or n cents a share from n million or n cents a share a year earlier

<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> reeling from thrift - accounting changes mandated by <unk> and the recent collapse of the junk - bond market announced a loss for the third quarter of n million or <unk> a share
for the quarter a year ago <unk> reported earnings of n million or n cents a share
total assets increased to n billion in the latest quarter from n billion a year earlier
the loss stems from n million of write - downs on <unk> <unk> billion high - yield investment securities portfolio which includes about <unk> billion of junk bonds n million of preferred stock and <unk> securities
<unk> owes its spectacular growth in recent years to its junk - bond portfolio the largest of any <unk> thrift
much of <unk> junk - bond trading has been done through the high - yield department of its <unk> <unk> neighbor <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
for the nine months losses totaled <unk> million or <unk> a share compared with net income of n million or <unk> a share a year earlier
the results include a n million write - down of the securities in the high - yield portfolio to the lower of their cost or market value
<unk> also added n million to reserves for losses on the portfolio increasing general reserves to n million or about <unk> of the total portfolio as of <unk> n
on <unk> <unk> loss reserves stood at n million
thrift officials said <unk> the <unk> million reserve will be adjusted quarterly and will reflect the rate of dispositions and market conditions
the adjustments result from the recently passed thrift - industry bailout legislation which requires thrifts to divest all high - yield bond investments by n
previously <unk> did n't have to adjust the book value of its junk - bond holdings to reflect declines in market prices because it held the bonds as long - term investments
because <unk> now must sell the bonds within five years accounting rules require the thrift to value the bonds at the lower of cost or market prices
for its future strategy <unk> officials said n the thrift may branch out into commercial lending or managing outside investments as well as beefing up more traditional thrift activities
the quarterly results also reflected n million in non - recurring losses from commercial real - estate activities in <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> chairman said in a statement that the thrift was disappointed by the effects of the accounting changes
but he said <unk> <unk> remains one of the most strongly capitalized thrifts in the industry based on the economic value of its assets and tangible capital
<unk> announced the results after the close of the stock market
its shares closed at n each in composite <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> trading down n cents
the price of <unk> shares has been cut nearly in half since <unk> when they traded at about n as investors apparently realized that the thrift would be forced to take a big write - down
the stock decline accelerated in the past two weeks from a price of <unk> a share on <unk> n
<unk> officials said n they do n't know how quickly they will dispose of the thrift junk bonds because federal regulations such as those that would allow thrifts to continue holding the bonds in separately capitalized subsidiaries have n't yet been completed
<unk> officials also said n the thrift should n't face problems meeting regulatory capital requirements despite the large reserves and write - downs and stiffer regulatory requirements that should be in place by year end
its ratio of tangible equity to total assets as of <unk> <unk> was <unk> and total equity was n million
the thrift emphasized that it has a large portfolio of equity securities issued in connection with corporate restructurings and leveraged buy - outs which has a book value of n million
although many of the transactions related to those securities have n't been completed <unk> said <unk> the ultimate gain on the sale of those assets will range from n million to n million
<unk> also has unrealized gains in its public equity securities portfolio of more than n million

<unk> - <unk> <unk> . said n it plans to aggressively discount its major beer brands setting the stage for a potentially bruising price war as the maturing industry growth continues to slow

with the passing of the heady days of swelling industry sales however the once - sporadic and brief forays into discounting are becoming standard competitive weapons in the beer industry

<unk> <unk> noted that the disappointing earnings which fell five cents a share short of his own projections contributed to the sell - off by an edgy and currently unforgiving investing public

while the third - quarter earnings were a moderate disappointment he said n the real bad news is the intensity of price competition in the premium - beer sector

the <unk> roll call illustrates the limits of power <unk> a resurgent abortion - rights movement still faces
it continues to gain strength in the chamber but remains far short of the two - thirds majority required to prevail over <unk> <unk>
democrats voted to override by a n margin but republicans were equally firm in support of the president who has threatened to make abortion a decisive issue on at least three separate fiscal <unk> spending bills
yesterday vote dealt with the largest of these bills an estimated n billion measure funding the departments of <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> services
to gain more leverage abortion - rights advocates may seek to fold the bill into an omnibus continuing resolution next month
but the stark numbers yesterday when <unk> votes were needed indicate n the president is in a commanding position for at least this year
unless he changes they lose said a democratic leadership aide
the action came as <unk> sent to the president last night a stopgap spending bill <unk> to keep the government operating through <unk> <unk> and provide n billion in emergency funds n to assist in the recovery from <unk> <unk> and the <unk> earthquake
by a lopsided <unk> margin the <unk> approved the measure after attaching further provisions sought by the influential <unk> delegation and despite reservations the <unk> adopted the bill on a n roll call
the package is more than n billion above the recommendations of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> this week
but given the political importance of <unk> the administration was content to use its influence to prevent any <unk> amendments adding further new appropriations
the n billion measure comes on top of n billion appropriated after <unk> struck the carolinas and <unk> last month and these totals do n't reflect the additional benefit of low - interest disaster loans
the bill last night includes n million n to help finance this credit and further raises the obligation ceiling for the <unk> <unk> <unk> sixfold to n billion to accommodate the expected loan activity
in direct cash assistance <unk> billion is provided in federal highway construction funds and n billion is divided between general emergency aid and a reserve n to be available to the president to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters
in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> used his position to win not only the expanded credit but also more generous treatment than the <unk> had permitted in the distribution of highway funds in the next six months
the emergency assistance would n't be counted against a state normal allocation of annual highway funds and the bill circumvents existing restrictions that otherwise would prevent the use of federal aid to repair a toll road such as the <unk> <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> damaged in last week earthquake
the underlying stopgap bill is the second required by <unk> this fall and since the current fiscal year began <unk> n only the <unk> and <unk> departments are operating on permanent appropriations enacted into law
the standoff over abortion is certain to contribute to further delays and apart from the health and education measure vetoed by <unk> <unk> bills funding the <unk> of <unk> and the entire <unk> foreign - aid budget are in jeopardy because of related abortion or family - planning issues
the vote yesterday was the most partisan in many years and though the democratic leadership is ambivalent about how to address the abortion issue the debate is increasingly measured in party terms
the <unk> democrats who supported the override yesterday compare with <unk> who initially backed the rape - and-incest exemption two weeks ago and n last year on a similar vote
by comparison republicans have held closer to the anti - abortion movement
only <unk> <unk> members opposed the president veto a marginal increase over the vote two weeks ago and just n more than the n who supported the rape - and-incest exemption last year
at a recent <unk> <unk> meeting <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the ranking minority member of the <unk> <unk> <unk> argued with his friend <unk> <unk> against a veto and though <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> stood with the president yesterday they are plainly uncomfortable with his position
this is n't a political issue this is a moral issue said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the most eloquent spokesman for the anti - abortion movement
but after years of using the issue for its benefit the <unk> finds its candidates on the defensive
<unk> <unk> gubernatorial candidate <unk> <unk> <unk> pointedly returned from campaigning to vote against the president yesterday in contrast with his opponent <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who has ardently supported abortion restrictions in the past but was absent
in an extraordinary mix of cultures and church - state powers <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> lectured his fellow roman catholics including <unk> <unk> for having the chutzpah <unk> to disagree with the hierarchy of their church on abortion
<unk> <unk> <unk> was as blunt on behalf of the abortion - rights movement
this may not make <unk> <unk> a one - term president said the <unk> liberal addressing the republican side of the <unk>
but if you support him over rape victims this may be your last term
separately the <unk> last night approved a nearly n billion compromise spending bill providing the first construction funds for the administration ambitious space station in fiscal <unk> and incorporating far - reaching provisions affecting the federal mortgage market
the current ceiling on home loans insured by the <unk> <unk> <unk> would be increased to <unk> and the bill gives the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> new authority to facilitate the refinancing of subsidized loans for low - income homeowners
by a <unk> margin the appropriations <unk> leadership beat back an early challenge by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> provision
and on a closer <unk> roll call lawmakers upheld controversial agreements made by a <unk> - <unk> conference earmarking community development funds for more than n projects backed by often influential members

<unk> <unk> <unk> will retain a n share in <unk>
the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is expected to launch its own program trading vehicle today just as controversy over this trading strategy heats up
the <unk> <unk> this morning plans to begin trading its <unk> <unk> <unk> basket product the first program - trading vehicle carrying the exchange seal of approval
esps will allow institutional investors to buy or sell all <unk> stocks in <unk> <unk> index in a single trade of a minimum of n million
customized baskets of fewer stocks will also be available
the securities and <unk> <unk> gave provisional six - month approval to the <unk> <unk> basket at a meeting late yesterday
the <unk> at the same time approved a similar but smaller basket product on the <unk> <unk> options <unk> where the minimum will be n million
also approved was a plan to trade stock portfolios by computer after regular hours on the <unk> <unk> <unk>
the basket products are an evolutionary step in solving problems in trading big blocks of stock that came to light in the n market crash said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> overseeing his first public meeting said n there have been concerns that the <unk> <unk> basket could attract investors with a short - term perspective who would rapidly turn over the product thus increasing volatility
but <unk> <unk> the <unk> market regulation chief said <unk> he did n't believe <unk> this will spawn dramatic new program - trading strategies that will be destabilizing
the baskets on the <unk> <unk> and <unk> which involve the actual <unk> stocks unlike the stock - index contracts currently traded on the <unk> futures markets and index options on the <unk> will begin trading as critics step up their attacks on program trading and its contributions to the stock market wild price swings
the <unk> <unk> argues that its new product will help rather than hurt the situation by possibly drawing business from more - volatile forms of program trading
esps are also an attempt by the <unk> <unk> to head off the exodus of program trading business to overseas markets such as <unk>
<unk> <unk> officials also hope <unk> japanese investors will become interested in the exchange product
already many of the <unk> <unk> own floor traders are warning that the <unk> baskets are risky and not in the best interests of the investing public
the <unk> <unk> of <unk> brokers said <unk> the new product with the n million minimum will benefit only big institutional investors and could lead to wild spasms of volatility
stockbrokers who cater to individual investors said <unk> the <unk> <unk> new product confirms <unk> the exchange does n't want to curtail program trading which last month accounted for a record n of the exchange average daily volume
the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is losing its cool here said <unk> <unk> head of institutional trading at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>
the new stock baskets are going to make it easier for program trading to be done
and it going to be done more frequently as the result of having more access to it at different places
both the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> exchange market <unk> are designed for institutional investors
the <unk> <unk> lists its targets as pension plans mutual fund managers and index - arbitrage traders
in index arbitrage program traders buy and sell stocks and stock - index futures to profit from small price discrepancies between the markets
at the same time only four securities firms have signed up with the <unk> <unk> to buy and sell esps as market makers an unenthusiastic response
the market makers so far are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> unit <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> brothers <unk> unit
<unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> unit that has become the biggest program trader along with <unk> <unk> is n't a market maker although the <unk> <unk> hopes <unk> that will change
similarly the <unk> <unk> hopes to entice <unk> <unk> <unk>
neither has plans to be a market maker for now
traders said <unk> major securities firms are reluctant to become market makers because they fear n the baskets may attract only limited trading

attorneys involved in the talks said that the parties were closer to accord than they were a year ago when reports of an imminent agreement circulated
one individual said <unk> the shareholders accord was well worked out
however less optimistic attorneys warned that because of the tangle of numerous defendants and plaintiffs with overlapping claims there is always the possibility that the talks will again fall apart
a shareholders accord would provide the first restitution to thousands of individuals and institutions claiming losses as a result of insider trading by <unk> <unk> once the largest arbitrage fund in the <unk>
the plaintiffs are investors who bought and sold securities in which <unk> <unk> and his partnerships were dealing
some claim <unk> they suffered losses because they sold while he was buying and others because they bought while he was selling

<unk> <unk> of the <unk> d.c.-based law firm <unk> <unk> <unk> which represents <unk> <unk> in this matter said only that discussions are under way
there are no agreements yet
it has been three years since <unk> <unk> now in prison agreed to pay a n million fine to settle the government charges that he had traded illegally using insider information
out of this the government set up a n million fund for plaintiffs who can prove their financial losses
according to <unk> <unk> an attorney at <unk> <unk> the escrow agents for the fund as of <unk> n the fund amounted to n million
separately attorneys for the n or so limited partners have had serious discussions that could lead to the distribution of the partnership assets
the limited partners include insurance companies financial institutions and individual investors
an agreement with <unk> regarding the limited partners investments is an essential step toward getting their money back

federal courts urged to cut costs and reduce delays of civil suits
the study conducted by a task force of the <unk> <unk> suggests that <unk> should require the courts to develop the plans
the study was initiated by <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the <unk> <unk> think tank recommends that the courts adopt different tracks for different types of civil cases in order to separate the handling of highly complex suits from simpler ones
complex cases such as antitrust suits and many business disputes would receive intense supervision by federal judges to keep pretrial proceedings moving
standard cases would require less judicial attention and fast - track cases could be resolved quickly
the study also said n each federal court should set strict time limits for the pretrial exchange of documents and evidence ranging from as much as <unk> days for cases in the fast track to as much as n months for complex disputes
and the study said <unk> federal courts should set firm trial dates early in the process
to take advantage of local expertise and custom the study said <unk> <unk> should require each of the <unk> federal district courts to adopt its own plan to speed the handling of civil suits and to reduce the high costs in civil cases
although some of the study recommendations resemble those of similar projects the makeup of the task force was unusually diverse adding significance to the effort
it included lawyers from civil rights and consumer groups plaintiffs lawyers and defense attorneys corporate counsel and law professors

that storm hit the <unk> <unk> <unk> n closing the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for a time and preventing tankers from unloading
next week report could very well show an increase in crude inventories
dismissing the trade group numbers left traders plenty of time <unk> to worry anew about the latest reports on <unk> production
an <unk> - <unk> <unk> survey of integrated oil companies independent refiners and oil industry consultants indicates that the <unk> of <unk> <unk> countries increased its production to n million barrels a day in <unk>
estimates suggest n <unk> figure may be even higher
that level of production is n't of much concern as long as demand continues strong analysts said n
but the first quarter of the year is generally the weakest and <unk> production does n't seem to be slackening in anticipation of that
also maintaining current demand assumes no significant slowdown in world economies

in other commodity markets yesterday

the rumor which has been neither confirmed nor denied has <unk> buying <unk> to n bales for near - term delivery
one floor trader said that if there were chinese purchases they should have had a bigger effect on the market
another said that if <unk> was a buyer it would be the earliest n that country had made purchases since the <unk> crop year and thus would be a bullish sign
this trader characterized the recent price action as a contest between the fundamentalists who see higher prices ahead and the technicians who are basically buying cotton toward the bottom of the current trading range around n cents and selling it when the price climbs more than n cents
this trader said that he thought n the market would turn aggressively bullish from a technical standpoint if the <unk> contract was able to exceed n cents
he also noted that stocks on <unk> <unk> <unk> are currently projected at n million bales the smallest end - of-season supply since <unk>
cocoa
the modest sell - off which started on <unk> continued
the <unk> contract ended at <unk> a metric ton down n
the market is drifting at least partly because of a lack of crop information out of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> the two largest african producers

a similar situation apparently exists in the <unk> <unk> with no figures released yet this year compared with n tons as of this time a year ago
he said that if little cocoa actually has arrived at the ports shipping delays could result
this is the worry that probably brought steadiness to the market earlier in the week he said n
there was also some fear that without <unk> <unk> cocoa a large french cocoa merchant <unk> <unk> <unk> et <unk> might not be able to deliver cocoa against the contracts n it had sold earlier for <unk> delivery in <unk>
however the french merchant has about <unk> tons of old crop <unk> <unk> cocoa stored in the <unk> from an agreement n it had negotiated with the <unk> <unk> last spring

the partnership which had solicited takeover offers said <unk> it failed to receive any adequate bids for all of its operations but is reviewing offers for individual properties
<unk> is going on a capital - spending binge that could make its trade surpluses even harder n to shrink
its capital spending is growing at double - digit rates for the second year in a row and its superefficient producers of everything from cars to computer chips are rushing to expand capacity modernize factories and develop new products
the boom so huge says <unk> <unk> an economist at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> it makes you think of the <unk> <unk> when <unk> developed rapidly
the more factories and robots japanese manufacturers add the more they will be able to export and the less their domestic customers will need to import
at <unk> <unk> for example sales are up nearly n this year so the maker of cameras and computer printers is doing what any japanese company would do under the circumstances it is increasing capital spending by n
it is building among other things a new laser - beam-printer factory in western <unk> that can produce up to <unk> printers next year
some n of them are to be exported to the <unk>
even companies in smokestack industries wrestling with world - wide overcapacity are joining the boom
<unk> steelmakers are raising capital spending n this year to n billion
<unk> <unk> <unk> a shipbuilder buried in debt just a few years ago will build a machinery plant its first expansion in n years
so big is the capital - spending boom that japanese companies outlays in <unk> topped american companies domestic outlays by n billion to <unk> billion in the <unk> months ended <unk> <unk> even though <unk> total output of goods and services is less than two - thirds <unk>
from a financial standpoint the boom could n't come at a better time
many japanese companies expect record profits this fiscal year and japanese interest rates though up a bit recently are still low
and in a business system where shareholders have few rights and expect only modest dividends companies can plow their profits back into plant and equipment
but some economists and government officials here are n't applauding
they fear that the boom may be too big for <unk> or anyone else good
it an explosive cocktail thrown at the world says <unk> <unk> <unk> senior economist at the <unk> unit of <unk> <unk> <unk>
the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> is so concerned that it recently took the unusual step of urging japanese auto companies to exercise caution in capital spending
<unk> officials hope to avoid yet - another source of trade friction with the <unk> even though export restraints currently limit japanese car exports to the <unk>
not everyone is worried however
some economists and many japanese companies are puzzled by the warnings
the investment boom is mainly sparked they say <unk> by strong domestic demand and is n't likely to increase exports sharply
moreover much investment is n't aimed at increasing capacity
according to a survey of some n large companies by the <unk> <unk> <unk> expanded capacity is the goal of just n of the outlays for manufacturers alone the figure is <unk>
the manufacturers said <unk> <unk> of their spending is designed to improve products or add new ones <unk> is to cut costs <unk> is for research and development and the rest is for maintenance and other purposes
but the worriers remain unconvinced
with <unk> running enormous trade surpluses against much of the world they think that <unk> should meet the increased domestic demand by importing more
and eventually they contend n domestic demand will weaken forcing companies to emphasize exports again
if there a further drive to export says <unk> <unk> an economist at the <unk> <unk> <unk> that be a problem
even in the short run the investment boom could exacerbate a disturbing trend japanese exports are showing surprisingly little tendency to ease
japanese auto makers for example are increasing their production capacity in the <unk> the additional production should in part replace imported vehicles with locally manufactured ones
but although japanese companies increased their <unk> auto output by <unk> from <unk> to <unk> compared with the year - earlier period their exports to the <unk> will drop only <unk> this year <unk> <unk> <unk> estimates n
in contrast to previous economic booms japanese auto companies are n't just trying to boost production
many are pouring money into developing high - quality products to target affluent consumers and to some extent to avoid direct combat with cheaper cars from <unk> <unk> and <unk>
others are replacing older facilities with flexible assembly lines on which different models can be turned out at once
so many companies are investing in high - tech machinery that <unk> <unk> a robot maker also had to build a new plant
the buildup is making <unk> clearly more efficient more technologically advanced and more competitive declares n a western diplomat in <unk>
but whatever its effects on exports and imports <unk> investment boom during the past two years has been stimulated at least partly by soaring domestic demand
<unk> marathon economy growing at <unk> this year is now in its <unk> month of expansion and some economists are betting that the boom will outlast the record <unk> expansion in the late <unk>
japanese consumers are increasingly eager to spend their money especially on high - priced goods such as n television sets and luxury cars
<unk> <unk> <unk> domestic auto sales are up <unk> this year largely because its expensive <unk> <unk> and <unk> models are in heavy demand
one dealer told me that if he had more cars he sell them right away says <unk> <unk> <unk> executive vice president
he adds that the company is trying to keep up with demand by overworking its employees
similarly <unk> <unk> <unk> sales are so brisk that workers grumble n they have n't had a <unk> off in years despite the government encouragement of more leisure activity
with demand growing and workers in short supply many japanese manufacturers are spending heavily on automation
among them are the shipbuilders which had halved their shipyard work forces to cut costs during a prolonged slump in demand but now are capturing an increased share of the strengthening global market
<unk> <unk> industries <unk> a medium - sized shipbuilder expects its sales to increase n this year largely because of rising demand for oil tankers
once one japanese company steps up its investments the whole industry follows
because most businesses put market share above profitability to let a competitor addition to capacity go unmatched is to concede defeat
the emphasis on market share is evident at <unk> industries <unk> <unk> biggest maker of industrial air conditioners
seeing new office buildings sprout up and its sales soar <unk> is building another plant which will lift its production capacity n
the expansion is aimed not just at meeting demand but also at expanding the company market share to <unk> from <unk> currently
besides <unk> major competitors <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> industries <unk> are all adding production lines a <unk> spokesman says n
until now we were trying to increase productivity with the facilities n we already had
but we ca n't produce enough anymore
the competition is even more heated in the auto industry where companies are racing one another in a world - wide market
<unk> aims to expand its n share of the market to <unk> by spending n million on a plant in southern <unk> that could make as many as n cars a year
meanwhile <unk> <unk> <unk> n million buildup is increasing its annual capacity by n cars and <unk> is spending n million on expansion
<unk> <unk> <unk> is still considering its options but it boldly aims to double its annual domestic sales to n cars in the next four years
those who are n't worried about how japanese manufacturers investments will affect trade note that many new products are n't replacements for imports
although imports account for less than n of beer sales in <unk> <unk> breweries <unk> which has been gaining share with its popular dry beer plans to fend off japanese competitors by pouring n billion into facilities <unk> to brew n more beer
but new - product development will make japanese companies stronger and big investments in domestic industries such as beer will make it even tougher for foreign competitors to crack the japanese market
moreover much of the investment boom is in high - tech fields in which japanese companies have only limited foreign competition so more investment practically assures more exports
<unk> <unk> for example is spending n million on two new plants to build four - megabit dynamic random access memories the next generation of computer chips
the product is n't widely used yet but <unk> which has already beaten everyone else in producing the current - generation one - megabit drams believes that its early investment will heighten its chances of beating its competitors again
it important to gain leadership a <unk> spokesman says
meanwhile <unk> <unk> rivals <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> are n't sitting still
after doubling production in one plant <unk> is spending n million to build another plant that in two years will be able to make a million four - megabit <unk> a year
the new chip plants wo n't be excessive investment says <unk> <unk> <unk> an <unk> vice president
we have enough products n to make and the markets n to sell these products
some of <unk> goods being produced as a result of the investment boom are already successful overseas
<unk> <unk> <unk> automobile a luxury model that it started shipping to the <unk> only last month is racking up orders at a time when u.s.-made luxury - car sales are slow
<unk> plans to raise <unk> exports when a new plant starts up next year
what if its sales weaken someday
japanese companies have a caveat competitor attitude
if excess capacity develops they say n not everyone will suffer
the losers will be those with the least attractive products and many of them analysts think n will be foreign companies
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> it plans to restructure in the wake of a third - quarter loss of n million or <unk> a share reflecting an n million addition to loan - loss reserves

the company said <unk> the restructuring initial phase will feature a gradual reduction in assets and staff positions
the plan may include selling branches consolidating or eliminating departments and winding down or disposing of unprofitable units within <unk> months
initially the company said n it will close its commercial real - estate lending division and stop originating new leases at its commercial lease subsidiary
details of the restructuring wo n't be made final until regulators approve the regulations mandated by the new federal act the company said n
<unk> <unk> a maker of mainframe computers reported a sharp decline in net income for its third quarter citing pricecutting by competitors and adverse effects from a strong <unk> dollar
net income fell <unk> to n million or n cents a share from n million or n cents a share in the year - ago period
revenue rose <unk> to n million from n million
<unk> results were somewhat worse than expected
<unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk> <unk> said n he expected the <unk> <unk> company to earn n cents a share for the quarter and said <unk> the firm weaker profit was partly the result of increased competition from <unk> <unk> machines <unk> <unk> principal competitor for mainframe sales

federal health officials are expected today to approve a program granting long - deferred access to the drug <unk> for children with acquired immune deficiency syndrome
announcement of the approval is expected to be made by <unk> <unk> secretary of <unk> and <unk> services
the clearance by the <unk> and <unk> <unk> comes after two years of restricted access for the youngest victims of <unk> to the only antiviral drug yet cleared to treat the fatal disease
the drug will be given treatment investigational new drug status a label accorded to drugs believed effective but lacking formal approval
the move will make the drug available free of charge for a time to children with the disease and symptoms of advanced infection
adults with <unk> have had access to <unk> since <unk> approved the drug usage for adults in <unk> <unk>
but despite more than two years of research showing <unk> <unk> can relieve dementia and other symptoms in children the drug still lacks federal approval for use in the youngest patients
as a result many youngsters have been unable to obtain the drug and for the few exceptions insurance carriers wo n't cover its cost of <unk> a year
so far <unk> has stricken <unk> children under age <unk> with many times that number believed to carry the infection without symptoms
to date n of those children have died according to the federal centers for <unk> <unk>
mothers of young <unk> patients expressed somber satisfaction
thank goodness n it happening
it should have happened sooner said <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> mother and activist who contracted the <unk> virus through a blood transfusion and transmitted it to two of her children
one of them a daughter <unk> died a year ago at age seven after her parents unsuccessfully pleaded for the drug
i could get <unk> says <unk> <unk> who bears her infection without any symptoms
but my daughter could n't until she was too ill to take it
to watch your child die is an inhuman experience
her son healthy and symptom - free currently takes no medication
the delay in getting <unk> to children has been blamed on a combination of factors
traditionally the medical establishment has waited two years to approve adult treatments for pediatric uses because of a combination of conservative safety standards and red tape
secondly critics have charged <unk> maker <unk> <unk> <unk> with corporate inertia because children account for just n of the patient population and hence a small part of the large and lucrative market
<unk> has replied that it is moving ahead to compile the relevant data and recently promised to develop a pediatric syrup form easier n for youngsters to take
still all this comes nearly a year and a half after <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> offered evidence that <unk> could reverse the ravages of <unk> dementia sometimes prompting dramatic recovery of <unk> levels and reappearance of lost motor skills
since then roughly n pediatric patients have received the drug in his program
to some mothers the expected <unk> action is a poignant reminder of what might have been
my first reaction is <unk> i do n't understand why it taken so long
why has it taken people so long for people to understand <unk> pediatric <unk> is a major problem asked <unk> <unk> whose son <unk> died six years ago at age three victim of a tainted transfusion
similar sentiments were voiced on <unk> <unk>
while i pleased <unk> the <unk> is finally releasing <unk> for children it taken much too long to get to this point said <unk> <unk> <unk>
why did it take <unk> <unk> so long to apply for treatment investigational new drug status the <unk> <unk> <unk> asked
let not forget <unk> this is the same company that has been profiteering with this drug for <unk> <unk> years <unk> <unk> added

the bad news in the junk bond market yesterday was that <unk> <unk> a group of restaurant chains became the latest prospective issuer <unk> to get a cold shoulder from bond buyers
the good news to fans of stable credit at least is what the rejection says about the state of mind of junk buyers
apparently they are learning to say no to excess risk

what was n't mentioned is that <unk> and its investment banker <unk> <unk> <unk> just completed a two - week road show for the purpose of marketing the bonds

<unk> junk bonds were n't as junk bonds go unusually weak
its fast - food restaurants including <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> the only significant fast - food chain <unk> to specialize in char - broiled chicken are stable recession - resistant and growing

there is nothing wrong with the company says <unk> principal <unk> <unk>
the rub he says <unk> is that the junk market is n't as deep as before
tw stockholder meeting was postponed from tomorrow to <unk> n
by then <unk> hopes to be able to sell less - junky junk bonds
<unk> <unk> <unk> is likely to contribute more than the <unk> million in equity <unk> it had planned on
banks may contribute more senior debt
and the total amount of junk financing will be reduced
a <unk> banker putting a best possible face on it asserts that very few people said n they did n't like the credit quality
people said n they did n't think <unk> a billion - dollar deal would trade
but trading risk stems from credit risk
and by adding equity <unk> would seem to be acknowledging that credit risk was a concern
indeed the <unk> banker says n in the reborn capital structure cash coverage of interest will meaningfully improve
as he sums it up we are listening to the market
what is it to borrow a term from <unk> that so unsettled the market
some of the same risks that were cited and seemingly ignored in dozens of previous junk offerings
the <unk> prospectus says that if the acquisition had been completed earlier pretax earnings would have been insufficient to cover its fixed charges including interest on debt securities by approximately n million in the first six months of <unk>
tw notes as many junk issuers do that adjusted to eliminate non - cash charges <unk> would have run a cash surplus in this case of n million over six months
but such calculations ignore the noncash charge of depreciation taken to allow for the gradual wearing out of french friers deterioration of stores and the like
in fact <unk> says n the company envisions capital expenses of about n million a year
<unk> pitch was that sales and earnings at its restaurants have risen steadily and that people wo n't stop eating during a downturn
but they wo n't necessarily eat at <unk>
the fast - food business is intensely competitive notes <unk> <unk> <unk> analyst <unk> <unk>
prospective bond buyers noted that <unk> historically has prospered because it has been willing to spend aggressively on remodeling restaurants and redoing menus
we were concerned that they were n't going to generate enough cash for capital spending and also <unk> to pay down debt says a big investor in high - yield debt
<unk> argues that <unk> could if necessary cut capital spending since half of what it plans to spend is for growth rather than maintenance
but investors noted that under the shelved offering <unk> would have needed to grow to meet its debt payments
its calculations for meeting cash charges ignore n million a year in interest on cash - deferred or zero - coupon debentures which ultimately would have had to be paid
the prospectus notes n there can be no assurance that future growth will continue at past levels
in the recent past bond buyers did n't seek such assurance
now apparently they do

<unk> <unk> who was practicing the read - my-lips school of politics years before <unk> <unk> encountered it has made clear her opposition to refashioning <unk> free - market policies to suit the bureaucrats in <unk>
in return <unk> <unk> is excoriated from <unk> <unk> to <unk> as an obstructionist

<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> the paper said n were enraged
the <unk> <unk> said <unk> she had contravened protocol
as usual her sin was saying what she thought
she issued a separate statement separating herself from a <unk> document reasserting the political value of imposing sanctions against <unk> <unk>
while supporting the <unk> in utterly condemning apartheid her statement urged it to encourage change rather than inflict further punishment on the country black population
actually there is a consensus somewhere on sanctions in <unk> a <unk> <unk> found that most south african blacks n oppose economic sanctions

it is refreshing to see at least one world figure who knows what she believes in and is not inclined to reflexively compromise those beliefs

one day last <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and olympics superagent <unk> <unk> met for lunch at the <unk> <unk> here
<unk> <unk> told <unk> <unk> that olympics officials wanted n million or more for tv rights to the <unk> <unk> games in <unk>
the <unk> official said <unk> that price sounded fine
at that price <unk> was the only player at the table when negotiations with the <unk> <unk> <unk> started in <unk> <unk> n
<unk> <unk> a committee member began by disclosing that <unk> and <unk> had refused to even bid
then he asked <unk> <unk> to raise his offer anyway if we can have a number that starts with a three you can have a dea

<unk> <unk> responded it a deal
a beaming <unk> <unk> announced his lastest coup at a news conference that afternoon
<unk> <unk> rivals at <unk> and <unk> grimaced at the price
how could <unk> get pushed into outbidding itself
well <unk> mired in the ratings cellar and looking to sports as a way out wanted to close the deal immediately and block its rivals from getting another chance to bid
but <unk> <unk> has been put in the uncomfortable role of setting off a bidding frenzy for sports rights a frenzy that the networks had hoped to avoid
the price of poker has gone up crows <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> executive director
with <unk> <unk> on a spending spree that may top <unk> billion for four years of major sports events the new bout of hyperinflation could jolt the entire broadcast business
<unk> itself could run up losses of a few hundred million dollars on four years of various sports if its big gamble goes wrong
<unk> a unit of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> also risk losses if they outbid <unk> for other contracts
while rights fees head skyward ad rates wo n't
advertisers already are balking at higher prices
the networks are paying too much for rights warns adman <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
if they ask advertisers to absorb the costs they likely to lose all but a few who need sports above all
viewers may not be cheering either
soaring rights fees will lead to an even greater clutter of commercials
at the same time some sports events will move off free television and onto cable or pay - cable where half the nation tv homes ca n't see them
<unk> has changed the rules by throwing out the old basis for sports bids that is can the network alone make a profit on it
<unk> <unk> emphasizes the ancillary benefits of positive press contented affiliate stations enthusiastic advertisers and huge audiences that might stick around to watch other <unk> programs when the game is over
the billion - dollar question is how much are those benefits worth
some tv people doubt n they will materialize and argue that even if they do they wo n't offset the multimillion - dollar deficits that <unk> could run up
as we seen in the <unk> says <unk> <unk> the president of the <unk> sports channel those deals can turn sour if the numbers do n't work
and three years later in a sea of red ink the heroes can find themselves with a lot of explaining <unk> to do
<unk> pursues top sports to belie the fact that they are n't supporting affiliates viewers and advertisers charges n <unk> <unk> <unk> who was ousted as chairman of <unk> <unk> after <unk> a. <unk> bought a <unk> stake in the company and took over three years ago
they lost the entertainment crown and they needed one
and they bought one
on just three big deals for four years of baseball and for the <unk> <unk> games in both <unk> and <unk> <unk> bid a total of n billion
that well over half a billion dollars more than <unk> and <unk> were willing to pay
after <unk> the winter and summer olympics will be held two years apart with the revised schedule beginning with the winter games in n and the summer games in n
now <unk> <unk> a former college basketball player who says <unk> a good negotiator needs a level of focus and intellectual attention similar to a good athlete - s is facing the consequences of his own aggressiveness
next month talks will begin on two coveted <unk> contracts for the pro and college basketball finals
<unk> is likely to spend whatever it takes to keep them
the potential bill more than n million for several seasons an <unk> jump
a few months later <unk> college and pro football contracts come up for renewal they could go for close to n million more than <unk> now pays a n to n rise
what happens to those two basketball contracts will shape the next five years of network sports says <unk> <unk> a former <unk> sports president now at <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> former president of <unk> says <unk> <unk> may come in with a huge bid for college basketball to take it away from <unk> and say we can overbid too
and the winners will be the colleges not either network
nor by the way advertisers
<unk> <unk> is an unlikely big spender
in the n after <unk> had just bid a record n million for the <unk> <unk> games he sniped at rivals for paying reckless prices
i love <unk> but he was the guy who complained most bitterly and loudly says <unk> <unk> a former <unk> sports president
and yet his company is one reason why rights are so high today
rivals carp at the principle of <unk> as <unk> <unk> <unk> once put it he always expounding that rights are too high then he going crazy
but the <unk> <unk> <unk> is hardly a man <unk> to ignore the numbers
a <unk> law school graduate he began his career in corporate law and then put in years at <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> talent agency
in <unk> he joined <unk> sports to head business affairs and five years later became its president
<unk> <unk> says that when he spoke out a few years ago i did n't say forever and i did n't say every property
the market changed he adds n
and he is n't the only big spender <unk> will pay a record n million for the <unk> <unk> games and <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> will shell out n million for four years of baseball airing n regular - season games a year
our competitors say n we overbid them
who cares
maybe we recognize values n the other guys do n't <unk> <unk> says
<unk> <unk> <unk> events strategy jelled after <unk> <unk> took over
<unk> <unk> recalls that in <unk> n after <unk> annual meeting in <unk> he and <unk> <unk> took the n train ride back to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> used this extended private audience to outline his ambitions
<unk> <unk> a billionaire in hotels and finance was just learning the tv business
five months later <unk> <unk> took over as <unk> chief executive and soon he was wielding sole approval each time <unk> <unk> <unk> scribbled a frighteningly large figure on a slip of paper sealed it in an envelope and gave it to sports negotiators
then in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> urgently needed to make a bold statement to quell rumors that he might sell the network
<unk> <unk> gave him one he bid n million for rights to the <unk> <unk> games in <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> would n't bid even n million
that started the still - raging bidding wars
the major events strategy <unk> <unk> says <unk> is designed to notch a place for <unk> on the crowded tv dial of the <unk>
it also a fast fix for an ailing image
he sees flashy sports as the only way n the last - place network can cut through the clutter of cable and vcrs grab millions of new viewers and tell them about other shows premiering a few weeks later
next <unk> <unk> for the first time wo n't have to start the season against the much - watched american and national baseball league championships and the <unk> <unk>
i been struggling against that for years says <unk> <unk> who runs <unk> - <unk> the <unk> - owned station in <unk>
even if baseball triggers losses at <unk> and he does n't think n it will i rather see the games on our air than on <unk> and <unk> he says n
that is n't surprising
regular tv series ratings have slumped in the past five years and premiering new shows is a crap shoot <unk> <unk> says n
but top sports events are still a strong bet to lure audiences n or n larger than those <unk> <unk> usually gets
<unk> <unk> says baseball and the olympics may help <unk> move up to <unk> . n in the household ratings race putting pizazz back into the network image
and the winter olympics will air during the <unk> sweeps when ratings are used to set ad rates for local stations
that will please once - grumpy affiliates another aim of the <unk> plan
they gleefully await the dream season in <unk>
<unk> will air the <unk> <unk> baseball playoffs college and pro basketball finals and other premier sports events
it made me more committed to <unk> says <unk> a. <unk> the president of <unk> <unk> broadcast group which has two <unk> affiliates
the <unk> plan to use big - time sports as a platform for other series carries no guarantee of success however
no amount of hype will bring viewers back if the shows are weak
in this market of n channels sophisticated viewers and the remote control trial is n't a guarantee of anything <unk> <unk> <unk> says
if the show ai n't a killer they gone
during the <unk> <unk> games for example <unk> touted <unk> to <unk> but the military drama was missing in action within weeks
last <unk> during the <unk> <unk> games <unk> relentlessly pitched a new series <unk>
it belly - flopped anyway
moreover sports is hardly the best way n to lure adult women
<unk> <unk> might move up to <unk> . n in household ratings most advertisers buy based on ratings for women aged <unk> to n
<unk> may remain a distant no . n in that regard
nor is <unk> a shoo - in <unk> to get blockbuster ratings
in recent years the <unk> <unk> and the olympics were aired against <unk> last - place lineup
but <unk> will put the athletes up against <unk> <unk> cheers and other shows in <unk> <unk> . n schedule
even the boon to affiliate relations may be limited
the sports lineup may add only <unk> to <unk> to a station annual profits
it alone is n't likely to stop a station from dumping <unk> shows
the <unk> <unk> seven nights was n't enough of an incentive says <unk> <unk> of <unk> - <unk> in <unk> which dropped <unk> for <unk> six weeks ago
you got to judge where the network will be in three years
the intangible benefits may prove extremely costly if <unk> ca n't avoid big losses on the sports coverage itself
and avoiding such losses will take a monumental effort
on the <unk> billion baseball agreement alone <unk> is likely to lose n million in four years contends <unk> <unk> <unk> the former <unk> man now at <unk> <unk>
nevertheless he deems the deal plain smart for its huge promotional value
<unk> <unk> calls that loss estimate wildly inaccurate conceding only that <unk> will lose money on baseball in the first year
it too early to tell what happens after that he says n
but <unk> <unk> expects losses in all four years of the contract he told <unk> senators n last <unk>
<unk> will pay an average of n million more each year than <unk> and <unk> had paid together and those two networks expect losses on baseball this season
yet <unk> will air only n regular - season games n fewer than <unk> and <unk>
that has outraged some fans
it also indicates a n million drop in ad sales for regular - season games a risk <unk> <unk> took to get an unprecedented lock on all playoff games
if the playoffs end in four - game sweeps losses could soar
advertisers are resisting higher prices which would help close the gap
<unk> signed <unk> motors and <unk> to be the only auto - maker sponsors in baseball for four years
<unk> n million
but ad executives who negotiated the deal say <unk> that works out to only n for a <unk> ad in the <unk> <unk> through <unk> <unk> less than what <unk> is charging for the <unk> this month
moreover there no question n ad rates will come down considerably from the <unk> - <unk> price says <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
other admen however say <unk> rates could rise later if ad spending surges
the winter games outlook also is mixed
<unk> expects to make modest profits but rivals contend that it will take a beating
<unk> lost n million on the <unk> <unk> games partly because of its n million rights fee
it aired <unk> hours of mostly live events in <unk> helping raise ratings slightly from <unk> but still failed to deliver the audience promised to advertisers
<unk> will add <unk> <unk> hours to that load in <unk> and ratings could be hurt by a lack of live events
all prime - time fare will be on tape - delay because of time differences with <unk> so the results can be announced on the <unk> o'clock news
<unk> <unk> will pay <unk> n million to air n hours of <unk> coverage plus n hours of additional events
<unk> <unk> the agent who took <unk> <unk> to lunch last <unk> says that even if <unk> loses say n million it matters little
ten million ai n't jack man when you got n billion sitting in the bank says <unk> <unk> senior vice president at <unk> <unk> <unk> citing <unk> enormous cash reserves from selling off various businesses
it does n't mean anything it public - relations money
moreover sports has claimed its place as a guaranteed ratings - getter says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the commissioner of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
this is n't outlandish bidding this is a situation of very careful businessmen making judgments about the worth of product and acting on it
i would tend to trust their judgment
that easy n for him to say <unk> four - year <unk> pact now at n million for four years could double in price by the time n his talks with <unk> <unk> are completed later this month
that would cut into <unk> slim margin for profit and error
<unk> sports earned n million or so last year
and <unk> takes in the least money in prime time <unk> and <unk> charge <unk> to <unk> more for ads according to a <unk> survey
but <unk> costs are huge and the risks go up with each new sports package that <unk> locks up
although sports officials predict jumps of <unk> to <unk> in the major contracts coming up for renewal ad rates may rise only <unk>
<unk> hopes to save money by ordering fewer episodes of regular series because sports will fill up a few weeks of prime time
but the savings will be minuscule
each hour of olympics and baseball in prime time will cost <unk> n million to n million an hour - long drama costs only <unk> and it is aired twice
<unk> may cushion losses with about n million a year in interest earned on the proceeds from selling <unk> records and other businesses
but media - stock analyst <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> says <unk> <unk> <unk> wo n't take kindly to that
on a stand - alone basis the network ought to make money he says
when <unk> <unk> is asked directly can you make money on all this he does n't exactly say yes
what you really asking is <unk> the profit and loss margins anticipated on the events acceptable to management he says
then he answers his own question
yes they are
that the only question n we need to address
place a phone order through most any catalog and chances are n the clerk who answers wo n't be the only one on the line
bosses have big ears these days
or open up an electronics magazine and peruse the ads for sneaky tape recorders and other snooping gadgets
some would make even <unk> <unk> green with envy
eavesdropping both corporate and private is on the rise thanks to the proliferation of surveillance technologies
and while sellers of the equipment and companies monitoring employees have few qualms right - to-privacy advocates and some lawmakers are alarmed
new technologies are changing the way n we deal with each other and the way n we work says <unk> <unk> a staff attorney at the <unk> <unk> liberties <unk>
our expectation of confidentiality is being eroded
on the corporate side companies claim that monitoring employee phone conversations is both legal and necessary to gauge productivity and ensure good service
the practice is common at catalog insurance and phone companies banks and telemarketers according to trade groups and worker organizations
it also widespread for reservations clerks in the airline car - rental hotel and railroad industries
the <unk> <unk> of <unk> which opposes such monitoring says <unk> supervisors listen in on an estimated n million calls each year
among companies saying n they monitor employees are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the circulation department of this newspaper
some <unk> <unk> firms monitor for recordkeeping purposes
<unk> <unk> says n there a big business demand for its voice - activated taping systems whether the sophisticated <unk> <unk> system which costs from <unk> to <unk> and can record <unk> conversations simultaneously or simple handheld units selling for <unk>
businesses want to verify information and ensure accuracy says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> manager of media relations
the state of <unk> recently bought the <unk> system he says n to monitor the <unk> cleanup effort
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> say n they use voice - activated systems to record and verify orders between salesmen and traders
<unk> says n it has taped some of its institutional trading desks such as commodities and futures for about four years
both companies stress that employees know n they are being recorded and that customer conversations are n't taped
<unk> <unk> <unk> says <unk> it monitors bond - trading conversations between brokers and customers to safeguard order accuracy
eavesdropping by individuals is harder n to measure
but devices are there for the asking whether in stores or through the mail
the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> for instance offers the <unk> <unk> attache case which can surreptitiously record conversations for nine hours at a stretch
that and other fancy gizmos may cost thousands but simple voice - activated tape recorders sell for as little as n at electronics stores like <unk> <unk>
the most common use of spying devices is in divorce cases say n private investigators
while tape recordings n to uncover say infidelity are n't admissible in court they can mean leverage in a settlement
concerned with the increased availability of surveillance technology and heavier use of it lawmakers have proposed laws addressing the issue
nine states have introduced bills requiring that workers and customers be made aware of monitoring
and four states <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> have adopted rules that all parties involved must consent when phone calls are recorded
two bills in <unk> hope to make such restrictions national
in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> introduced congressional legislation that would require an audible beeping during any employee monitoring warning people that they are being heard
the legislation is similar to a n beeper bill that was defeated after heavy lobbying by the telemarketing industry
also last spring <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> introduced a bill requiring universal two - party consent to any tapings in cases that do n't involve law enforcement
in addition products such as voice - activated tape recorders would have to include beep tones and labels explaining federal laws on eavesdropping
the outlook on both federal bills is uncertain especially remembering the n defeat
the <unk> and worker organizations back tighter laws but employers and device manufacturers object
i sympathetic with workers who feel under the gun says <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> which is lobbying strenuously against the <unk> beeper bill
but the only way n you can find out how your people are doing is by listening
the powerful group which represents many of the nation telemarketers was instrumental in derailing the <unk> bill
<unk> also opposes the beeper bill saying n the noise n it requires would interfere with customer orders causing irritation and even errors
<unk> <unk> center manager at the catalog company customer order center in <unk> <unk> defends monitoring
we like to follow up and make sure n operators are achieving our standards of company service says <unk> <unk> who supervises <unk> operators
<unk> <unk> a <unk> spokesman says <unk> the telephone company needs to monitor operators to evaluate performance during the first six months on the job
sometimes he says we pull someone off the phones for more training
federal wiretap statutes recognize the right of employers to monitor employees for evaluation purposes
and in the past <unk> has viewed monitoring as an issue best handled in union negotiations
but opponents led by the <unk> say <unk> new laws are needed because monitoring is heavily concentrated in service industries and n of monitored workers are n't represented by unions
the <unk> claims that monitoring not only infringes on employee privacy but increases stress
nine to five a <unk> - based office workers organization that supports the beeper bill six months ago started a privacy hot line <unk> to receive reports of alleged monitoring abuses
meanwhile supporters of the <unk> two - party consent bill say n it is needed because of a giant loophole in the one - party consent law
currently if the person taping is a party to the conversation it all right to record without the knowledge of the other person on the line
intercepting other people private conversations is illegal and punishable by five years in prison and fines of <unk>
the electronics industry is closely following the <unk> bill
some marketers of surveillance gear including <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which owns the <unk> <unk> <unk> and others like it already put warning labels in their catalogs informing customers of the one - party law
but vendors contend that they ca n't control how their products are used
<unk> <unk> says n it has a policy against selling products if a salesperson suspects n they will be used illegally
everything sold at <unk> <unk> has a legal purpose says <unk> <unk> president of the <unk> <unk> subsidiary
he says n he has n't yet studied the <unk> bill but that requiring a beeping tone on recorders would be ludicrous
still <unk> <unk> is aware that some of its products are controversial
a few years ago the company voluntarily stopped selling the <unk> <unk> a powerful microphone
with its ability to pick up rustlings and flapping wings it was meant to be a toy for children for bird watching says <unk> <unk> <unk>
but we were getting too many complaints that people were using them to eavesdrop on their neighbors
the hottest rivalry in the computer industry intensified sharply yesterday as <unk> <unk> <unk> announced its first line of mainframe computers targeting <unk> <unk> machines <unk> largest market
<unk> fired back with new mainframes of its own extending the long - dominant n line with a n to n power boost
up to now the intense competition between <unk> and <unk> has been confined largely to the broad midrange of the computer market where <unk> sought to exploit <unk> weaknesses in networking
but <unk> move into mainframes will target <unk> home turf where it has a commanding n share of the market
<unk> <unk> <unk> insisted yesterday that its marketing focus would differ sharply from <unk>
this is not your father mainframe said <unk> <unk> a <unk> spokesman
it a whole new generation he said
<unk> which gets about half its revenue and more than half its profit from mainframes also announced upgraded operating system software that together with the new hardware lets customers do so - called batch processing as much as <unk> faster
batch processing is the high - volume single - job data processing that most mainframes typically chug through at night such as updating accounts at banks
<unk> said <unk> the <unk> new <unk> and <unk> models will generally be available immediately though three wo n't ship until the third quarter of next year
prices on the larger models which range as high as n million generally wo n't change
small models whose performance increased as much as <unk> will carry higher prices
upgrades to bigger models also will be costlier
<unk> <unk> <unk> mainframes which it claimed <unk> were among the fastest available were priced from n million to n million sharply lower than <unk> models of comparable power
the first models will ship in the spring with the largest following in the fall
analysts were disappointed that <unk> new line apparently wo n't contribute much to earnings before the next fiscal year which begins in <unk>
<unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said n he may cut his earnings estimate for the current fiscal year because he had expected at least some mainframe profit this year
but he added that he expected to raise his estimate for fiscal n at the same time
after the announcement yesterday <unk> shares gained <unk> to close at <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> composite trading
<unk> shares closed at <unk> down n cents in <unk> <unk> trading
analysts have predicted strong pent - up demand for the new line among digital customers
large digital buyers say n the new <unk> will let them stay with <unk> when they need the power of a mainframe instead of turning to <unk>
i convinced n there a huge market for this machine said <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
<unk> also plans to compete fiercely with <unk> when the giant customers are computerizing new aspects of their businesses
<unk> however does n't expect to displace <unk> mainframes that are already installed at big companies
in addition to commercial markets <unk> new line targets the low end of the engineering and scientific supercomputer market when it packaged with an optional supercharger known as a vector processor
digital push into mainframes comes at a time when its mainstay minicomputer line is under growing pressure from smaller personal computers and workstations that operate on standard operating systems rather than on the proprietary systems that older minicomputers use
although <unk> has staked out a major presence in the booming workstation market profit margins in that market are much slimmer than for mainframes
the slow - growing mainframe market also has shown new signs of life lately
<unk> mainframe sales have held up better than expected this year with analysts estimating n they have risen <unk> to n
demand for these systems has been very very strong said <unk> <unk> a senior <unk> marketing executive
we have a good strong backlog for the fourth quarter even without the systems that were announced yesterday
but the n line is nearly five years old which is getting up there in mainframe years and its growth is expected to slow in <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> said n it wanted to bring out the mainframes as soon as it could to spark as many sales as possible by the end of the year
the fourth quarter is always <unk> biggest by far with most sales coming in <unk> as customers seek to use budgets before year end
still <unk> <unk> an analyst at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said i do n't see that this will be sufficient to give <unk> a significant kick in the fourth quarter
<unk> has already indicated n it will have problems in the quarter partly because of a delay in shipping a high - end disk drive and partly because the strong dollar will cut significantly the value of <unk> overseas earnings when translated into dollars
some analysts have estimated <unk> <unk> fourth - quarter per - share earnings will fall <unk> to n a share from <unk> a share a year earlier

it said <unk> it filed an action of its own in federal court in <unk> <unk> <unk> seeking a declaration that <unk> claims are invalid
this is in response to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> looking for the real thing in <unk> editorial page <unk> n
though i agree with many of <unk> <unk> comments i believe n he points the gun in the wrong direction it is n't the americans who must be criticized for not understanding the japanese culture but the japanese who insist on forcing their culture on americans
the japanese want us to accept their culture but they refuse to accept the american culture
japanese managers ca n't expect americans to behave as if they were japanese instead they must manage americans as americans
americans are expected to conform to the japanese culture when in <unk>
what is wrong with expecting the japanese to conform to american norms when they locate here
americans place native or native speakers in charge of subsidiaries overseas
european multinationals do likewise even in <unk> their affiliates are usually run by american managers
but the japanese insist upon japanese managers everywhere n they set up shop
do the japanese feel so superior that they can not find capable american managers
<unk> a. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> suggests that <unk> electronics <unk> workers were having difficulty understanding their foreign bosses perspective
while <unk> <unk> does an excellent job of explaining the differences both cultural and philosophic i question his perspective
would he suggest that employees of an american company doing business in <unk> conform to their new bosses culture and philosophy
obviously not
thus the conclusion is that the burden rests with management to understand\/adopt the culture and philosophy of the country in which they are operating
the workers can be motivated and the company reach its full potential only when management embraces the employees perspective
a. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
i believe <unk> <unk> <unk> left out one major aspect of japanese culture that permeated his piece the belief in the superiority of japanese culture and behavior vs. others
a manager should not have to rebut the opinions of his employees about the style of his management
instead he should listen to see how that criticism can be used constructively to advance his objective of carrying out a set of tasks through the efforts of his subordinates
japanese culture vs. american culture is irrelevant
the key is how a manager from one culture can motivate employees from another
for <unk> <unk> to argue that american employees must passively accept a direct imposition of the japanese way of doing things is outright cultural chauvinism of the first order
the japanese are neglecting the opportunity to synthesize a new corporate culture based on a fusion of the best aspects of both national cultures
<unk> <unk> is accurate to deny a specific anti - american bias
it is more difficult to deny a general bigotry in seeing things only the japanese way
when the response to criticism is only a better explanation of policies without altering the reasons for the criticism i am convinced that <unk> <unk> has still failed to attack the root cause of the problem and is simply treating symptoms
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> reported that net profit climbed n in the first half of <unk> and said that it expects a gain of about <unk> for the full year
the french water treatment group said <unk> consolidated net profit after payments to minority interests rose to n million francs us$ n million from n million francs in the first half of <unk>

<unk> des <unk> said <unk> the earnings gain was led by its water energy and building activities
as a presidential candidate in <unk> <unk> <unk> forthrightly expressed his position on abortion in an interview with <unk> <unk> magazine published that <unk>
what did he think of the <unk> <unk> decision legalizing abortion
i happen to think n it was right <unk> <unk> said flatly
a few months later <unk> <unk> became <unk> <unk> running mate
suddenly <unk> <unk> the pro - choice advocate became <unk> <unk> the anti - abortionist
and the vacillation did n't end there
just a month ago <unk> <unk> sternly threatened to veto a pending welfare bill if it provided any abortion funds except to save a woman life
then two weeks ago declaring that i not looking for any conflict over this the president said n he would consider a compromise to fund abortions for poor women in cases of rape and incest
but only four days after that <unk> <unk> resurrected the veto threat
i do not support federal funding for abortions except where the mother life is threatened he proclaimed and finally vetoed the measure last weekend
so what does <unk> <unk> really believe
the answer is so murky that it is beginning to get this popular president in trouble with each of the increasingly vocal increasingly powerful sides of the abortion issue
the result is mistrust and criticism from all around
<unk> - abortion forces regard him as at best an uncertain ally
in all honesty if you ask me is this man a true believer i do n't know says <unk> <unk> head of the <unk> - based <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> of <unk> <unk>
yet abortion - rights forces remain bitterly critical
<unk> <unk> vice president of communications for the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> calls <unk> <unk> position on the abortion - funding issue extremely cruel adding the guy has n't done one thing about prevention
he totally geared to a punitive position
<unk> <unk> is plainly uncomfortable with the entire abortion question
for most of the past nine years he has striven to convince anti - abortion activists of his stalwart support for their position
but ever since the <unk> <unk> <unk> vs. <unk> <unk> services decision this year changed the political landscape of the abortion issue the president seemingly has tried just as hard to avoid saying anything more unless pressed to the wall
many americans still agonize over their own personal feelings about abortion
<unk> <unk> problem is n't so much that he seems to be agonizing over the issue as it is that he seems to vacillate on it
the political risk would be far less if the president drew a firm line and hewed to it experts insist n
if you have a position you better off to stick with it than to move around very much says republican strategist <unk> <unk>
the need for consistency is especially acute for <unk> <unk> who <unk> <unk> maintains n lacks a strong ideological base
by his moderate republican heritage as well as the warnings of political advisers who say n the issue is vital to younger voters the president might seem to have at least some sympathy with abortion - rights arguments
yet he is also firmly bound by his hard - line rhetoric and promises n he made to anti - abortion activists during his long pursuit of the <unk> <unk>
on many issues flag - burning for instance his keen political sensitivities overcome such conflicts
but <unk> <unk> and his advisers miscalculated the politics of the abortion issue failing to grasp how dramatically the abortion - rights movement would be aroused following last summer <unk> <unk> decision to restrict those rights in the <unk> case
it was one of the quickest changes in public attitudes n i ever seen says former <unk> pollster <unk> <unk>
these days when others raise the subject of abortion the usually loquacious president can be close - mouthed almost to the point of curtness
ten days ago he was asked to amplify the reasons behind his anti - abortion stance
my position is well - known and well - stated he replied
a close look at his record over the last n years suggests that <unk> <unk> has well - stated his views on all sides of the issue
in <unk> as the <unk> representative to the <unk> <unk> he wrote an introduction to a book on world population in which he boasted of his leadership during his term in <unk> in expanding family - planning services for the poor
running for president in early n he was also quoted as supporting federal funding for abortions in cases of rape incest and to save the life of the mother
in his <unk> <unk> interview in <unk> <unk> <unk> volunteered his abortion - rights remarks to contrast himself with his rival <unk> <unk>
in addition to supporting the landmark <unk> vs. <unk> <unk> <unk> decision legalizing abortion <unk> <unk> said <unk> he opposed the constitutional ban on abortion that <unk> <unk> was promising to promote
as <unk> <unk> running mate though <unk> <unk> plunged headlong into the anti - abortion position endorsing a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion
he acknowledged only one difference with <unk> <unk> that the amendment ought to have exceptions for rape and incest as well as to save a woman life
throughout the early n <unk> <unk> was quoted sometimes supporting federal funding for abortion in cases of rape and incest and sometimes opposing it
in <unk> n then - <unk> <unk> <unk> had his staff write a letter spelling out that he would support a constitutional amendment banning abortions except in cases of rape incest and life endangerment but that he opposed federal funding in all but the latter case
at the <unk> convention last year he again came out for an amendment with exceptions for rape incest and life endangerment
his rhetoric gathered momentum as he rolled into office affirming his firm support of our cause during an anti - abortion rally three days after his inauguration last <unk>
he again urged passage of a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion
but when the high court ruled in the <unk> case in <unk> the president began to lower the volume
when the ruling was handed down the vacationing president dispatched <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> to issue a statement and refused to answer questions himself
he did later threaten vetoes over legislation restoring the <unk> of <unk> right to use its own tax money to fund abortions for poor women and over restoring funding to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
but in the months since then while trying to drum up support for other issues such as an anti - flag-burning constitutional amendment he has shied away from talking about abortion
what few comments he has initiated have been oblique such as urging greater efforts toward the protection of human life at a meeting of catholic lawyers in <unk> last month
the <unk> <unk> has likewise avoided any involvement in <unk> recent special legislative session on abortion which anti - abortion forces had regarded as a key test of their ability to get state lawmakers to toughen abortion restrictions
the session failed to enact any new curbs
now some see <unk> <unk> trapped in a position n he is neither comfortable with nor able to escape
<unk> <unk> head of the <unk> <unk> <unk> a group of party moderates observes the administration finds itself in an ideological cul de sac that it will find it difficult if not impossible to get itself out of
<unk> <unk> <unk> n editorial - page article toward more <unk> lawsuits misses the point
the n americans with disabilities <unk> is about eliminating discriminatory barriers
when we look closely at our own history it is clear that our constitutionally mandated civil rights have evolved not through the goodness of people hearts but through legislation and constitutional amendments
this is how american women won the right to vote
and it is how <unk> - americans and other minority groups were guaranteed their equal rights as citizens in this nation
for the more than n million americans with disabilities the n americans with disabilities <unk> provides the missing piece
disabled americans have had their civil rights guaranteed in all federally funded programs since <unk> <unk> was passed as a part of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
the <unk> act simply extends these guarantees to the private sector
those who fear a plethora of suits paralyzing our legal system need only look at the record on the <unk> <unk>
without legal recourse there are no guarantees of civil rights for anyone
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> it is consolidating control of its asian operations under a new organization here that will be headed by <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> - <unk> will coordinate the activities of <unk> subsidiaries in <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and work with <unk> business associates throughout the region
these functions are currently performed out of <unk> <unk> and at <unk> headquarters in <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> executive director of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> since <unk> <unk> was named vice president of <unk> <unk> - <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> buoyed by improved operating profit in its tire segment reported that third - quarter net income rose <unk> to n million or <unk> a share
in the year - ago period <unk> had net of n million or <unk> a share
sales rose slightly to n billion from n billion
analysts had mixed responses to the results
<unk> <unk> an independent analyst in <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> he was impressed with the company performance
he said <unk> results were better than he expected and indicate that <unk> is in the midst of a turnaround from a string of lackluster quarters that have plagued the company for a year
however <unk> <unk> an analyst at <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> results fell at the bottom of his range of estimates
excluding an increase in the tax rate and the effects of foreign currency translations <unk> <unk> said <unk> the company results were still a little disappointing
<unk> stock which has been weak in recent weeks fell n yesterday to close at <unk> a share in composite trading on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the <unk> <unk> - based company said n pretax operating income in its tire segment jumped about <unk> to n million from n million a year earlier reflecting improvements in raw material costs sales of replacement tires and pricing
<unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> appeared to have held or gained some market share in the <unk> for the first time since the second quarter of <unk>
but <unk> said <unk> total <unk> tire unit sales were off about n
total tire segment sales were up only about <unk> to n billion and the company said <unk> it reduced manufacturing levels at some of its <unk> tire plants because of inventory adjustments and slackened production by auto makers
in the latest quarter <unk> tax rate was n compared with <unk> a year earlier
as a result total tax outlays were n million compared with n million the year earlier
for the nine months profit skidded about <unk> reflecting charges taken in this year second quarter and the effect of translations of weaker foreign currencies into the stronger <unk> dollar
net was n million or <unk> a share compared with net of n million or <unk> a share the year earlier
the latest nine months included charges of n million related to the company south african subsidiary and unused pipe sold by its crude oil pipeline unit
sales rose nearly n to n billion from n billion
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said n it expects to report minimal earnings or a loss for the third quarter
the environmental services company said that the discontinuation of unsuccessful product lines and an increase in baddebt reserves probably will result in charges of n million to n million most of which will be taken against third - quarter results
in the year - ago quarter the company reported earnings of n million or n cents a share
former <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> may have been lucky n he retired last <unk>
as he handed over the reins to successor <unk> <unk> <unk> steel profits were close to a cyclical peak
though imports were troublesome they were n't running away with the market and american companies had high hopes that steel import quotas would be extended for another five years
perhaps most important <unk> <unk> who had once threatened a hostile takeover bid was subdued
he and <unk> <unk> were even dining out together
today <unk> <unk> presides over a company whose fortunes have changed abruptly
<unk> <unk> the company deep - pocketed tenacious adversary recently disclosed that he had raised his <unk> stake to <unk> and he again threatened a takeover
a battle with <unk> <unk> would rattle even the most seasoned chief executive to say nothing of one who took the helm less than five months ago
in addition <unk> giant steel segment representing n of its n sales is facing softening demand and slipping prices as well as increasing competition from foreign steelmakers and low - cost minimills
the import quotas got only a <unk> <unk> extension and <unk> is laboring under a staggering <unk> billion debt at a time when it must spend money to upgrade steel mills and drill for oil
it a baptism of fire for <unk> says one <unk> executive
the burning question is whether the new chief can parry <unk> <unk> without being pushed into unwelcome moves
<unk> <unk> might have to dismember the company more than he wants to
or he might have to incur a huge expense of either buying <unk> <unk> stock possibly at a premium or paying stockholders a special dividend partly because of <unk> <unk> pressure
with his recent purchases of <unk> common stock <unk> <unk> shattered a three - year-old unwritten standstill agreement with <unk> <unk>
in <unk> <unk> <unk> adroitly dodged <unk> <unk> first bullet after the takeover specialist had built up an <unk> stake
<unk> <unk> did so by having <unk> redeem a series of guaranteed notes a move that in effect raised the cost of a <unk> billion <unk> bid by about <unk> billion
and he managed to fend off further advances and even strike up an unlikely friendship with the interloper
over dinners at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> restaurants the steel executive and the big investor talked steel international trade and thoroughbred horses
<unk> <unk> who has boned up on corporate raiders by reading <unk> <unk> <unk> autobiography had hoped n the detente would continue
he was shocked associates say n to learn of <unk> <unk> new takeover threat
both men declined to be interviewed for this article
but the fiercely competitive <unk> <unk> quickly showed <unk> he no pushover
he huddled with directors at a special meeting two weeks ago and tried to block his opponent
although the board believed that <unk> <unk> is more interested in talking the stock price higher than acquiring <unk> it adopted a poison - pill defense n to be swallowed if anyone amasses a <unk> stake
now it <unk> <unk> move
will he try to gain a seat on or control of the board and force a radical split of <unk> into separate oil and steel companies
given the weakness of the junk - bond market can he finance a buy - out
<unk> <unk> may not want to sell out unless he can get a special dividend similar to one <unk> he received before selling his stake in <unk> <unk> in <unk> a coup that gave him enough cash n to make his <unk> move
and although the recent turmoil in the stock and junk - bond markets by making it harder to arrange takeover financing has eased some of the pressure on <unk> <unk> it does n't end the takeover threat
i know n it not over a sober - faced <unk> <unk> acknowledged while greeting steel suppliers in <unk> <unk> on <unk> n and inviting them to a buffet of salmon and sushi in honor of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> partner in a steel mill in <unk> <unk>
in fact it barely begun for <unk> <unk> who faces tough decisions before he has had a chance to get settled into his new job
he in a vulnerable position because he has n't established much credibility on his own says <unk> <unk> a securities analyst at <unk> <unk>
the n tax attorney never even aspired to the job of chief executive
an undistinguished college student who dabbled in zoology until he concluded that he could n't stand cutting up frogs <unk> <unk> wanted to work for a big company that could do big things
but after joining the tax department of a <unk> subsidiary n years ago he set the modest goal of becoming tax manager by the age of <unk>
for years he quietly stuck to the back accounting rooms wearing a hat to work because everyone else did
i was never a rebel he said in an earlier interview
i do n't think n most of the people that have been around me would ever say <unk> they seen me pound the table or get angry
yet the unassuming <unk> <unk> helped chart <unk> transition from <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk>
he served as <unk> <unk> front man in tense negotiations for the <unk> purchase of <unk> <unk> for n billion
nevertheless <unk> <unk> once named chief executive did n't waste any time distancing himself from his former boss who still has an office on the <unk> floor of the <unk> tower in <unk>
soon after taking over last <unk> <unk> <unk> rescinded a pay cut imposed on clerical workers a move that <unk> <unk> had n't made in spite of improved earnings
<unk> <unk> also ruled that all board meetings would be held in <unk> instead of <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> home
and earlier this month he announced the sale of the reserves of <unk> <unk> gas which was acquired three years ago and has n't posted any significant operating profits since
one former executive says nobody wanted that deal inside <unk> except <unk> <unk> who was a hunting and fishing buddy of <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman of <unk> <unk> gas
the executive recalls <unk> <unk> whispering to him and others remember this was <unk> deal
what miffed many <unk> executives and shareholders was that the acquisition for <unk> billion of stock doubled the <unk> shares outstanding and considerably diluted them
what more the takeover occurred as natural - gas prices were falling and just as <unk> <unk> <unk> reported its first annual loss in n years
<unk> <unk> expected the <unk> <unk> <unk> sale to delight <unk> <unk> by addressing his concern about boosting shareholder value
but when the two men met in <unk> <unk> a day after <unk> <unk> disclosed the rise in his <unk> stake <unk> <unk> learned that <unk> <unk> wanted him to sell all of <unk> <unk> not just its reserves of about n trillion cubic feet of natural gas and n million barrels of oil but also its pipeline gas - gathering and contract - drilling operations
that would leave <unk> with <unk> its steel mills and its diversified business segment which includes among other things mineral and transportation products
some speculate that <unk> <unk> would agree if he could find a buyer at the right price
the problem is that <unk> <unk> is pushing him to move faster and further in restructuring <unk> than <unk> <unk> had planned
<unk> <unk> has long believed associates say <unk> that the company whose n sales totaled n billion is worth <unk> a share if broken up
the stock closed yesterday at <unk> giving <unk> <unk> n million shares a value of n billion
<unk> <unk> advocates the sale of the company steel operations and <unk> <unk> does n't necessarily disagree
unlike his predecessor who saw steel as <unk> backbone <unk> <unk> tends to view it as a capital - draining and labor - intensive business with limited potential associates say n
in the past five years <unk> has turned steel into a profit maker by closing several plants and reducing labor costs
but the short - term outlook is so - so
it is n't surprising that <unk> <unk> and <unk> view steel so differently
while <unk> <unk> was reared in the shadows of <unk> smoking mills <unk> <unk> grew up in <unk> a city nicknamed <unk> and more accustomed to pork chops than pig iron
he has never met <unk> <unk> the president of the <unk> steelworkers union and is n't active in the industry main trade group the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> which <unk> <unk> served as chairman
<unk> thought <unk> the country needed a strong <unk> <unk> and while <unk> agreed he was more apt to say not at any cost to shareholders a former executive says
indeed <unk> <unk> at an <unk> press conference talked about investing in steel as long as it provides a good return and not a day longer
however shedding steel would run directly counter to <unk> <unk> original rationale for diversifying into oil and gas having two major products would lessen the company vulnerability to one market down cycle and help smooth out the flow of cash and earnings
as <unk> <unk> once said we a two - product company and boy if you ca n't figure out the value of those two parts you are so damn dumb that you do n't belong on <unk> <unk>
moreover the opportunity to sell steel at a price acceptable to <unk> may be gone for now
the time has passed <unk> for us to spin off steel either in a public offering or to a buyer one executive contends n
about the only way n that <unk> now can get out of steel is to dish it out piece by piece in separate joint ventures he adds n
with <unk> <unk> breathing down his neck however <unk> <unk> may have little choice but to sell at a weak price even if it means losing some steel - related tax - loss carryforwards
that would leave <unk> essentially an oil company with <unk> as its core
<unk> has benefited from higher crude - oil prices and strong demand for refined products
oil has long been <unk> <unk> pet
indeed when the <unk> administration finally decided this summer to renew import restrictions arguably the most important decision n to affect the steel industry in five years <unk> <unk> and his directors were aboard helicopters high above <unk> rich oil reserves in the <unk> <unk>
should <unk> be left with only <unk> <unk> <unk> might well feel pushed to scout out other energy companies
however even <unk> executives who work closely with him are n't sure about his long - term goals
i do n't think n he has a clear sense of where he wants the company to go one says
right now the executive adds n he wants to continue to focus on paying down <unk> debt by selling assets
one thing is certain however <unk> <unk> while studying other options probably wo n't make a major move until he clear about <unk> <unk> intentions
and then he wo n't panic says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a former <unk> executive and now a labor and benefit consultant with <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>
<unk> <unk> learned presence under fire when as vice president of corporate planning he handled what <unk> <unk> calls don't - con-me negotiations that led to <unk> shedding of a wide array of assets ranging from chemicals to construction
when negotiating <unk> <unk> played his cards close to the vest
<unk> <unk> who worked for <unk> <unk> in strategic planning recalls how his boss would routinely ask a subordinate to research an entire industry to target acquisition candidates
what he really wanted to know was about a particular company but you did n't know that
he wanted your own unbiased virgin opinion says <unk> <unk> now managing director at <unk> <unk> a proxy - solicitation and investor - relations firm
ever the pragmatist <unk> <unk> said in <unk> that he realized that <unk> is on acquisition screens all over the country
it part of the capitalistic market system that equity can be bought and equity is bought he said
<unk> he noted <unk> was formed n years ago by in effect buying out a bunch of other companies
people got rich through takeovers in those days as they do today

<unk> has launched a new effort to prove <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> continues to practice terrorism and thus to persuade the <unk> to break off talks with the group
<unk> officials however said <unk> they are n't buying the israeli argument
israeli counterterrorism officials provided the <unk> <unk> with a n list of recent terrorist incidents n they attribute directly to forces controlled by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> publicly renounced terrorism <unk> n satisfying the <unk> precondition for a direct dialogue with the <unk>
a <unk> counterterrorism official said n experts are studying the israeli list
we have no independent evidence linking <unk> to any acts of terrorism since <unk> n <unk> he said referring to the specific <unk> group that <unk> <unk> heads
so far this list does n't change our view
<unk> wants to end the dialogue but our analysts take a different view than theirs
israeli <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> top adviser on counterterrorism <unk> <unk> was here <unk> to present the report to members of <unk> reporters and others
<unk> <unk> said <unk> he also presented the list last week to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk>
separately the <unk> <unk> <unk> reported that the israeli government had provided its correspondent in <unk> with different documents that <unk> said <unk> prove <unk> the <unk> has been conducting terrorism from the occupied arab territories
the <unk> <unk> said <unk> it has n't yet seen copies of those papers
if the dialogue was based on the assumption that <unk> or the <unk> would stop terrorism and we have evidence of continued terrorism what would be the logical conclusion <unk> <unk> asked
<unk> has long claimed <unk> <unk> <unk> never meant to renounce terrorism particularly because he and his lieutenants reserved the right to press armed struggle against the jewish state
now <unk> says n it is backing up its contention with detailed accounts of alleged terrorist acts and plans linked to <unk> <unk>
it blames most of these on <unk>
the new accusations come at a delicate time in <unk> efforts to bring about talks between <unk> and palestinian representatives
the <unk> <unk> said n it had received a new letter on the subject from israeli <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> restating <unk> previous objection to negotiating with any <unk> tied to the <unk>
deciding what constitutes terrorism can be a legalistic exercise
the <unk> defines it as premediated politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine state agents
to meet the <unk> criteria <unk> contended n it only listed incidents that involved civilians and occurred inside its n borders
at the heart of <unk> report is a list of a dozen incidents <unk> <unk> attributes to <unk> including the use of bombs and <unk> cocktails
but <unk> officials say n they are n't satisfied <unk> these incidents constitute terrorism because they may be offshoots of the intifadah the palestinian rebellion in the occupied territories which the <unk> does n't classify as terrorism
in addition the officials say <unk> <unk> has n't presented convincing evidence n these acts were ordered by <unk> or by any group <unk> <unk> <unk> controls
<unk> terrorism experts also say n they are highly uncertain about the veracity of the separate documents leaked to the <unk> <unk> <unk>
the papers which <unk> says <unk> were discovered in <unk> - occupied <unk> refer to terrorist acts n to be carried out in the name of a group called the <unk> eagles
some supporters of <unk> say <unk> <unk> policy on palestinian terrorism is colored by an intense desire to maintain the dialogue with the <unk>
but <unk> <unk> officials accuse <unk> of leaking questionable claims to embarrass the <unk>
the dollar finished lower yesterday after tracking another rollercoaster session on <unk> <unk>
concern about the volatile <unk> stock market had faded in recent sessions and traders appeared content to let the dollar languish in a narrow range until tomorrow when the preliminary report on third - quarter <unk> gross national product is released
but seesaw gyrations in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> yesterday put <unk> <unk> back in the spotlight and inspired market participants to bid the <unk> unit lower

by midmorning the <unk> had plunged n points and foreign - exchange dealers quickly drove the dollar down
when the <unk> modestly rebounded the dollar bounced back in choppy dealings but ended the day below the levels of late <unk>

some dealers said that the market strong reaction to <unk> <unk> reflects a general uneasiness about the dollar
they added that the <unk> swift drop proved an easy excuse <unk> for the market to drive the <unk> currency in the direction n it was already headed

<unk> <unk> a vice president with <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> sees a break in the dollar long - term upward trend a trend that began in <unk> n
he argues that the dollar is now moving sideways adding that the next leg could be the beginning of a longer term bearish phase
analysts peg the dollar recent weakness to an underlying slowdown in the <unk> economy highlighted by recent economic data particularly a surprisingly sharp widening in the <unk> <unk> trade gap
they also point out that narrowing interest - rate differentials between the <unk> and its major trading partners tend to make the <unk> currency less attractive to foreign investors
despite several spurts of dollar trading it was noted that mark - yen cross trade grabbed much of the market attention
following the dive in <unk> stocks the mark has strengthened more than its major counterparts
traders attribute the mark surge to a robust west german economy and higher rate differentials
but they add that the mark strength is in part a reflection of a shift away from <unk> assets by japanese investors into west german investments
the question remains how much can the west german market absorb says one senior dealer
some dealers say that <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> reassurance that japanese monetary policy wo n't be changed for the time being has given investors an added excuse n to push the yen down even further against the mark
despite the yen weakness with respect to the mark <unk> traders say n they do n't expect the <unk> of <unk> to take any action to support the japanese currency on that front

<unk> <unk> the upper - crust financial services concern that was rocked by a management scandal late last year has had a sharp drop in profitability mainly because a high - risk bet on interest rates backfired
<unk> <unk> fall from grace is bad news for its parent <unk> <unk> <unk> holdings <unk> which has relied heavily on the banking and money management unit contributions in recent years
in <unk> for example <unk> <unk> had an estimated pretax profit of at least n million while <unk> managed net income of just n million
<unk> does n't break out the earnings of its subsidiaries
but people familiar with <unk> <unk> performance say n the unit had profit of around n million for the third quarter after barely breaking even for the first six months
<unk> meanwhile posted net income of n million for the first nine months of the year down slightly from n million for the year - ago period
<unk> investors <unk> <unk> last week downgraded the long - term deposit rating of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> subsidiary to <unk> from <unk> citing problems in the company aggressively managed securities portfolio
<unk> <unk> a <unk> vice president said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> performance has been hurt this year by a mismatch in the maturities of its assets and liabilities
the mismatch exposed the company to a high degree of interest - rate risk and when rates moved unfavorably beginning late last year and continuing into this year it cost them <unk> <unk> said <unk>
<unk> <unk> noted that <unk> <unk> <unk> has taken some actions to better control asset - liability management and improve controls in general and we think n these will serve to improve credit quality
as some securities mature and the proceeds are reinvested the problems ought to ease he said n
but he also cited concerns over the company mortgage exposure in the troubled <unk> <unk> real estate market
<unk> <unk> officials declined to comment on <unk> action or on the unit financial performance this year except to deny a published report that outside accountants had discovered evidence of significant accounting errors in the first three quarters results
an accounting controversy at the end of last year forced <unk> <unk> to admit n it had overstated pretax profits by some n million
the resulting scandal led to the firing of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> president and to the resignations of the company chief financial officer and treasurer
the executives were accused of improperly deferring expenses and booking revenue early in an effort to dress up results and perhaps bolster performance - related bonuses
<unk> <unk> <unk> in turn attributed the controversy to judgmental errors by accountants and accused <unk> of conducting a witch hunt

<unk> <unk> <unk> is struggling as it enters the critical <unk> season
yesterday the retailing and financial services giant reported a n drop in third - quarter earnings to n million or n cents a share from a restated <unk> million or n cents a share a year earlier
but the news was even worse for <unk> core <unk> retailing operation the largest in the nation
<unk> said <unk> its <unk> stores had a loss of n million their first deficit for the period in more than five years
analysts estimated that sales at <unk> stores declined in the quarter too
the results underscore <unk> difficulties in implementing the everyday low pricing strategy that it adopted in <unk> as part of a broad attempt to revive its retailing business
under the new approach <unk> set prices that were somewhere between its old regular and sale prices
the company said n it would resort far less often to slashing prices to woo shoppers
sears officials insist n they do n't intend to abandon the everyday pricing approach in the face of the poor results
instead a spokesman blames the dismal third - quarter showing on an environment that is being distorted by a very harsh climate for sales of durable goods which account for roughly two - thirds of <unk> annual merchandise volume
the new pricing strategy is working the spokesman asserted n
he added that after an initial surge triggered by an advertising blitz in <unk> <unk> expected that the pricing program would n't have any effect on revenue
<unk> has been counting on growth coming from the large displays of brand - name merchandise n it is adding to its stores over the next two years in what it calls power formats
but analysts say <unk> <unk> faces an especially daunting challenge on the eve of the <unk> shopping season
i believe n everyday pricing in the current environment does n't work says <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> pointing to soft durable - goods sales
<unk> is likely to be unsuccessful if it continues with its pricing policy when everyone else is offering unusual values
in what amounts to an admission that the transition has n't gone as smoothly as <unk> had hoped the giant retailer is now trying new ways <unk> to drum up business without appearing to abandon its seven - month-old strategy
the company is highlighting more special deals in its advertising and stores and it offering to defer finance charges on certain big - ticket items
<unk> is also stepping up its television ads and changing its message
in a new tv ad for instance a woman going through the <unk> newspaper brands as hype claims by other stores that they are offering goods for <unk> <unk> and <unk> off
by lowering prices throughout its stores she says <unk> has the right idea
but the ad also mentions <unk> sales a topic that the retailer has avoided since switching to everyday pricing
when <unk> has a sale at a special price the woman in the ad declares it something n you do n't want to miss
recent surveys by <unk> <unk> <unk> associates a market research firm in <unk> suggest that <unk> is having a tough time attracting shoppers because it has n't yet done enough to improve service or its selection of merchandise
the number of people who said n they were more likely to shop at <unk> fell in <unk> to <unk> from <unk> in <unk> when <unk> blanketed the airwaves with ads about its new pricing strategy
moreover the number of people who spontaneously cited lower prices as the reason for their interest in <unk> declined to <unk> in <unk> from <unk> in <unk>
just n of the respondents mentioned brands in <unk> up slightly from <unk> in <unk>
only n of the people in <unk> cited <unk> friendly personnel
the power of price as an appeal which was very considerable in driving traffic in <unk> and <unk> has diminished says <unk> <unk> president of <unk> associates
you see some improvement in these other areas but it a very small and slow process
for the third quarter <unk> said <unk> its total revenue rose <unk> to n billion from n billion a year earlier
net income at <unk> merchandise group which includes international and credit card operations as well as <unk> stores fell n
profit at <unk> <unk> insurance unit fell <unk> to n million because of <unk> <unk> which inflicted the greatest single storm damage loss in the company history
<unk> said n claims from the storm as expected reduced its third - quarter net by n million or n cents a share
<unk> is expected to absorb another big hit in the fourth quarter as claims pour in from the <unk> <unk> earthquake
but a spokesman said n the quake wo n't have as big a financial impact on <unk> as <unk> <unk> did
net income at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> services group meanwhile rose nearly n to n million reflecting improvements in its basic stock brokerage and <unk> credit card businesses
profit at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> nearly quadrupled to n million because of gains on sales of property
in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> composite trading yesterday <unk> shares closed at <unk> up n cents
oil imports to <unk> rose <unk> in <unk> from year - earlier levels according to statistics released by the government <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk>
the imports totaling n million barrels were <unk> lower than <unk> levels
the year - on-year rise was partly because of higher demand for petroleum products and partly because of tax changes in n that left oil companies with high inventories in the late - summer\/early-fall <unk>
imports of crude from the <unk> <unk> grew <unk> from year - earlier levels and southeast asian crude imports grew <unk>
while mideast crude imports were higher compared with year - earlier levels they fell n compared with <unk> imports
southeast asian crude imports however were <unk> higher than <unk>

at this stage some people just walk away from homes where the mortgage exceeds current market value
but most of them could have afforded to keep up their payments they chose not to do so
the problem is so vast that we need to try innovative solutions in small - scale experiments
here are some ideas
n foreclosed homes could be sold by the <unk> for no down payment the biggest obstacle to young buyers but with personal liability for the mortgage no walking away by choice
n encourage long - term occupancy by forgiving one month payment off the tail end of the mortgage for every six months paid or perhaps have the down payment deferred to the end of the mortgage balloon but forgiven on a monthly pro - rata basis as long as the owner remains the occupant
n <unk> rental agreements with exclusive purchase options for the renter
an occupant will in most every case be better for the home and neighborhood than a vacant house
in this way the house is not dumped on to a glutted market
<unk> <unk>
the <unk> <unk> <unk> veterans <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> further aggravate the problem of affordable housing stock by buying in to their foreclosed properties of which there are alas many at an inflated balance due say n on a house worth n instead of allowing a free market to price the house for what it really worth
worse the properties then sit around deteriorating for maybe a year or so but are resold eventually because of the attractiveness of the low down payment etc to a marginal buyer who ca n't afford both the mortgage and needed repairs and having little vested interest that buyer will walk away and the vicious cycle repeats itself all over again

<unk> unemployment rate rose to n of the labor force in <unk> from <unk> in <unk> and was up from <unk> a year earlier according to quarterly figures from the state statistical institute

in the quarter the <unk> <unk> insurance unit reported n million before tax of capital gains from property and casualty operations
the subsidiary also increased reserves by n million however and set aside an additional n million for claims connected with <unk> <unk>

new orders for durable goods fell back slightly in <unk> after shooting up the month before reflecting weakening auto demand after a spurt of orders for new n models the <unk> <unk> reported <unk>
orders for military equipment household appliances machinery and other goods expected to last at least three years dipped n last month to n billion after leaping n in <unk> the department said n
most analysts had expected a sharper decline after the steep rise in <unk>
moreover a recent government report showing widespread layoffs in manufacturing had contributed to perceptions that the manufacturing sector of the economy had slowed to a crawl
but many economists pointed to a n <unk> rise in orders outside the volatile transportation category
that suggests <unk> the manufacturing sector is not falling apart said <unk> <unk> <unk> an economist at manufacturers <unk> securities <unk> in <unk> <unk>
she added however it is not robust by any means
while a decline in orders for cars and civilian airplanes pulled down the orders total an enormous jump in orders for heavy military equipment propped it up
orders for capital defense goods skyrocketed <unk> and a government analyst said <unk> nearly all areas saw increases including airplanes missiles ships tanks and communications equipment
orders for military goods usually catapult in <unk> government officials say <unk> as the <unk> scrambles to spend its money before the new fiscal year begins <unk> n
while all the numbers in the durable goods report were adjusted for seasonal fluctuations a <unk> <unk> analyst said that the adjustment probably did n't factor out all of the wide - ranging surge in defense orders
without the increase in defense bookings <unk> orders would have plummeted n
analysts were most unsettled by evidence n the backlog of orders at factories is slipping
unfilled orders for durable goods rose n in <unk> to n billion after declining for the first time in <unk> <unk> years in <unk>
in <unk> unfilled orders grew <unk>
but analysts noted that excluding transportation where what they believe was a temporary surge in auto demand pushed up the figures order backlogs have declined for three months in a row
it means n we eating into the bread that keeps us going
that is a little disturbing <unk> <unk> said
it also means n if you have a real drop - off in orders production will likely fall off very quickly because there is less n to keep things going
capital goods orders outside of the defense sector tumbled for the second month in a row posting a n drop after a n decline
such steep drops in a category seen as a barometer of business investment would customarily be grave news for the economy
but a <unk> <unk> analyst said that in both months orders would have risen had it not been for a drop in civilian aircraft bookings a category that is showing declines only after a huge surge earlier this year
still <unk> <unk> senior economic adviser at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> said if you look back a half - year or so the evidence was pretty good of affirmative strength in the capital - goods sector
now at least there are question marks about that and without any question the pace of growth has slowed
<unk> <unk> <unk> directors authorized the railroad company to buy back as many as n million of its shares which would have a current value of more than n billion

in a statement <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman and chief executive officer noted that the new repurchase program should serve to enhance shareholder value

analysts said n they expected the action and investors applauded the move
in composite trading on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> shares closed at <unk> up <unk>
still analysts do n't expect the buy - back to significantly affect per - share earnings in the short term
the impact wo n't be that great said <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>
that is in part because of the effect of having to average the number of shares outstanding she said n
in addition <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> is likely to draw down its cash initially to finance the purchases and thus forfeit some interest income
longer term however the buy - back is expected to increase earnings especially after <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk>
moreover the extensive program in effect establishes a floor for the stock price said <unk> <unk> <unk> analyst for <unk> <unk> <unk>
the buy - back is really a comfort to those who want to buy the stock that there is a price floor he said n
at a certain price if the management thinks n the stock is cheap they can go in and buy it

your <unk> n editorial reding wrighting <unk> on the recent education summit was like most pieces on the subject of education it had little n to say
oddly though on the very same page you printed a comment that addresses one of the most serious shortcomings of the american education system
unfortunately the comment was buried in another article so it could not stand out in an education context
in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in commenting on many differences between american and japanese culture said japanese children are raised in a way n many americans would find severe
after a wonderfully frivolous early childhood they are exposed to rigid discipline as soon as they enter school
what far too many people concerned about education either fail to understand or choose to ignore is that american children on the whole are among the most undisciplined in the world making any attempt at improvements in the mode of education potentially unsuccessful
unless parents and educators alike start to develop more discipline in children all the worthy concern discussions and actions will not solve the problem

<unk> is an auto parts maker
<unk> has climbed up from the ashes of <unk> <unk> <unk> and a gross national product of about n per capita to reach the heavyweight class among industrialized nations
now this remarkable economic growth seems to be coming to an end because the government has not converted itself into a modern democratic developed nation mode of operation
until n when <unk> joined the n per capita gnp club of the advanced countries it was a model developing nation
the government built ports bridges highways schools hospitals and railways
when industries were weak it protected them
it gave the japanese people a value system based on the rationalization that given the country lack of natural resources they must work hard to create value through exports and buy food with the surplus
individual prosperity inevitably would result
that system has worked
the standard of living has increased steadily over the past n years more than <unk> of the people consider themselves middle class
the people have given their leading and only credible political party the <unk> <unk> <unk> clear and uninterrupted power for those n years
the <unk> won by a landslide in the last election in <unk> <unk>
but less than two years later the <unk> started to crumble and dissent rose to unprecedented heights
the symptoms all point to one thing <unk> does not have a modern government
its government still wants to sit in the driver seat set the speed step on the gas apply the brakes and steer with n million people in the back seat
in a modern system the government role is to give the people as much choice as possible and to keep them well informed so they are capable of making a choice
it also allows people to buy the best and the cheapest goods from anywhere in the world
the japanese government does n't allow this
the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> actually is a ministry for farmers and fishermen instead of a ministry of provisions
the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> is a ministry of doctors and pharmaceutical companies rather than an organization dedicated to protecting the health of the people
the <unk> of <unk> is nothing but a cartel for licensed teachers and certainly does not act on behalf of students
the <unk> of <unk> spreads concrete throughout the country and boasts in international conferences that <unk> paved roadway per capita is the longest in the world but they seldom think of the poor commuters who spend so much time sitting in traffic
the <unk> of <unk> serves the industry certainly not the passengers who must pay extraordinarily high prices
and the <unk> of <unk> <unk> works for itself supporting japanese diplomats who sprinkle abundant aid money around the world to ensure that their seat at the dinner table is next to the host
this ministry has done nothing n to correct the misunderstandings and misperceptions that are at the root of <unk> deteriorating image
instead it seems to be using foreign pressure and even the trade conflict to expand its sphere of influence vis a vis other ministries
all this illustrates that japanese ministries still have a provider mentality they do not serve the people and particularly not consumers
they serve the industries and the special - interest groups
the rest of the world accepted such methods when <unk> was developing
japanese put up with it because the government provided job stability and growing paychecks
<unk> is not a political country
it is a bureaucratic country
the <unk> plays a minor role compared with the powerful bureaucratic system
most bills are drafted by bureaucrats not politicians
the <unk> does n't normally even debate bills because the opposition parties are so often opposed to whatever <unk> does that it would be a waste of time
so most bills are passed without full discussion particularly difficult bills are passed in the absence of the opposition parties
a recent example is the n consumption tax on all commercial activities
this makes enormous sense in <unk> where direct tax accounts for more than n of revenues and the capture rate of direct tax is so unfair
if you are a salaried man amen <unk> captured
if you are a retailer <unk> and a farmer n
to correct this inequality most people would have favored an indirect tax like the consumption tax
but the bill was passed without debate in the <unk> in the absence of the opposition
as a result the japanese people did n't know what to expect when the new law was introduced on <unk> n
they were frustrated by the longer queues at the cashier and the small coins given as change
all of a sudden prices were no longer in denominations of <unk> or <unk>
they were <unk> or <unk>
pockets exploded with one - yen coins
while people were jingling their change the <unk> politicians were caught in scandals
money such as in <unk> political donations and women as in the cases of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> seldom have caused political scandals in <unk>
whereas most men were a bit ambivalent about the sex scandals though they were furious about <unk> women were upset about both and surged to the polls
in the recent <unk> <unk> and <unk> metropolitan congressional elections in which the <unk> <unk> won a runaway victory <unk> of all women voted as opposed to the usual n
it is difficult to analyze how much of their anger was due to recruit the sex scandals or the one - yen coins in their purses but they obviously were voting to punish the <unk>
taken by surprise the <unk> <unk> is busy changing its doctrines
it now ok to deal with the <unk> but not the <unk> <unk>
nuclear power plants are acceptable
the <unk> <unk> <unk> can continue sort of
and so on
against the rapid cosmetic overhaul of the <unk> <unk> the <unk> has been paralyzed
now is the time n to reform the government from a provider developing - country vanguard role to that of a modern industrialized nation in which consumers have the ultimate choice
if the <unk> as currently composed ca n't make the transformation then it should split into two parties
one party could stand for consumer interests small government free trade and globalism to put <unk> clearly among the most developed and open countries
the other party could continue on the traditional track of the <unk> representing the manufacturers preference for larger government control regulation and protectionism
the <unk> must make a decision immediately <unk> <unk> elections must take place before <unk>
in the current mood of the japanese people journalists and even some industrialists giving power to the socialists might be good for the <unk> cleansing it of past sins
we must not forget however that such a humble political experiment could cause a global tidal wave of shocks in real - estate and financial markets
at the most there is only nine months before the <unk> fuse burns out
<unk> <unk> is managing director of <unk> <unk> in <unk>
early this century diamond mining in the magnificent dunes where the <unk> <unk> meets the <unk> <unk> was a day at the beach
men would crawl in the sand looking for shiny stones
it was as easy as collecting sea shells at <unk>
men are still combing the beach with shovels and hand brushes searching for that unusual glint
but only after a fleet of <unk> gargantuan earthmoving vehicles belonging to <unk> <unk> <unk> mines <unk> the world diamond kingpins do their work
last year n million tons of desert were moved from one dune to another to recover <unk> carats which comes to <unk> tons of sand per carat or one - fifth gram
oh yes the <unk> was also pushed back n yards
if there diamonds out there we get to them says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> engineering manager
here wedged between shifting dunes and pounding waves at the world most inhospitable diamond dig lies the earth most precious jewel box
thanks to centuries of polishing by <unk> <unk> first in the gentle current of the <unk> <unk> that carried the stones from <unk> <unk> interior then in the cold surf of the ocean and finally in the coarse sands of the desert n of the diamonds uncovered are of gem quality
while other mines might yield more carats a higher percentage of them go to industrial use
since this treasure chest is too big to fit in a bank vault it has been turned into one
months after railway worker <unk> <unk> first picked up a diamond from the sand in <unk> the german colonialists who controlled <unk> proclaimed a wide swath of the desert about <unk> miles north from the <unk> <unk> and <unk> miles inland from the <unk> a restricted area a designation normally reserved for military operations
when the germans lost <unk> <unk> <unk> they lost <unk> to <unk> <unk> and the diamonds to <unk> <unk> patriarch of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
today no one gets in or out of the restricted area without <unk> <unk> stingy approval
the mining zone has thus remained one of the most desolate places in <unk>
ghost towns dot the <unk> dunes proving n diamonds are n't forever
<unk> the mine headquarters is a lonely corporate oasis of n residents
jackals roam the streets at night and gemsbok hardy antelope with long straight horns wander in from the desert to drink from water sprinklers
on most days the desert heat and the cool of the ocean combine to create a mist like a damp rag
the wind stinging with sand never seems to stop
still miners from all parts of <unk> as well as professional staff from <unk> <unk> head offices in <unk> <unk> and <unk> keep coming
and <unk> boasts attractions besides diamonds
there are six video rental shops three restaurants one cinema and <unk> sports and recreation clubs for everything from cricket to lawn bowling
the pride of <unk> is the n golf course with the largest sand trap in the world
last year when the rising <unk> <unk> threatened to swamp the course the same engineers who are pushing back the <unk> rushed to build a wall n to hold back the flood
nothing is too good for our golf course says <unk> <unk> a mining engineer
despite fears n the mine may be partially nationalized by the new namibian government following next month elections freeing the country from south african control <unk> <unk> engineers are working to extend the mine productive life for another <unk> years from the current estimate of <unk>
huge machines that look as though they came from the <unk> <unk> desert - battle scene lumber among the dunes
mechanized vacuum cleaners probe the sand like giant anteaters a whirring ferris wheellike excavator with buckets instead of seats chews through layers of compacted sand tracks and conveyor belts shuttling sand to the screening plants criss - cross the beach
then there is the artifical sea wall n yards long and n yards thick jutting into the ocean
made of sand it receives around - the-clock maintainence against the battering waves
when the mining in front of the wall is complete it is moved northward
a companion jetty that helps hold back the sea looks like a rusting junkyard
engineers first used concrete blocks to bolster the barrier but the ocean tossed them aside like driftwood
then someone decided to try broken - down earthmoving equipment that inexplicably held against the waves
the <unk> people are n't too happy when they see their equipment used like that shrugs <unk> <unk>
they figure n it not a very good advert
despite all these innovations most of the diamonds are still found in the sand swept away by the men wielding shovels and brushes the ignominiously named bedrock sweepers who toil in the wake of the excavators
laboring in blue and gray overalls they are supposed to concentrate on cleaning out crevices and not strain their eyes looking for diamonds
but should they spy one the company will pay a bonus equal to one - third its value
for these workers at the bottom of the mine pay scale this is usually enough to overcome the temptation to steal a crime that could earn them up to n years in jail
still employees do occasionally try to smuggle out a gem or two
one man wrapped several diamonds in the knot of his tie
another poked a hole in the heel of his shoe
a food caterer stashed stones in the false bottom of a milk pail
none made it past the body searches and x - rays of mine security

the <unk> will pay if its error burdens you with bank charges
<unk> statement n sets out terms

if the <unk> admits its error and the charges have been paid it will reimburse a taxpayer who has n't refused to give timely answers to <unk> inquiries or has n't contributed to continuing or compounding the error
the <unk> recently amended the policy to cover stop - payment charges for checks lost by the <unk>
if the <unk> asks for and gets a replacement for a check that it concedes n it lost in processing it will reimburse the taxpayer for the stop - payment charge on the original
reimbursement claims must be filed with the <unk> district or service - center director within a year after the expense accrues
if the <unk> seeks late - payment interest because of the lost check you should request interest abatement publisher <unk> <unk> notes n
just five <unk> more are all n we need to feel really at home they say n
a couple n we call the <unk> spent nearly n on a n plot and main home and have an old n mortgage exempt from the new limit on mortgage - interest deductions
they plan to expand the home site by buying five adjoining acres for <unk> borrowed against a first mortgage on the five acres and also collateralized by the n acres
their debt will be well under the n million limit on borrowing to acquire build or improve a home that qualifies for mortgage - interest deductions
as you can guess the <unk> want to deduct home - mortgage interest on the <unk> loan
but <unk> private ruling <unk> notes n no rule or court case bears directly on the issue of adding land to a principal residence
so the <unk> has drawn a rationale from the sale of a home site split in two and sold in different years to the same buyer a court let the seller in that old case treat this as the sale of one residence
thus the <unk> says <unk> the <unk> <unk> loan is home - acquisition debt and interest on it is fully deductible

he plans to tell clients to pay certain fees directly to the foundation instead of to him he would omit those fees from income reported on his return
so he asked the <unk> if the plan would work
well notes n <unk> private ruling n a fundamental principle is that income must be taxed to whoever earns it
the rule goes back at least as far as a <unk> <unk> <unk> decision <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> says <unk>
if you assign your income to another you still have controlled its disposition and enjoyed the fruits of your labor even if indirectly
<unk> earns any fees sent directly to charity and is taxable on them the <unk> says <unk> of course he also may take a charitable deduction for them

so developers are saying n they will look into distressed properties
they go into someone else pasture as long as it greener than the one n they in now
developers are also forming more joint ventures with pension funds and insurance companies that can finance big projects

developers are teaming up with institutions often acting as project managers says <unk> <unk> <unk> president and president of <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
they are growing more pragmatic about their role
real estate firms are also using their alliances with financial institutions to amass acquisition funds
why should you beat your brains out fighting the environmentalists the neighborhood groups dealing with traffic mitigation sewers and fighting city hall then try to convince a lender to lend you money in an overbuilt market when you can get pension fund money buy a portfolio sell off pieces off it and play your own game says <unk> <unk> managing partner of the <unk> <unk> office of <unk> <unk> <unk> a national accounting firm
but experts say that when it comes to distressed properties finding diamonds in the rough is n't easy

but no matter how much <unk> gets under our skin we still have mom and apple pie
on second thought make that just mom
a japanese apple called the <unk> is cropping up in orchards the way <unk> hondas did on <unk> roads
by <unk> it will be planted more often than any other apple tree according to a recent survey of six apple - industry sages by <unk> <unk> <unk> horticulturist <unk> <unk>
some fruit visionaries say <unk> the <unk> could someday tumble the <unk> <unk> from the top of <unk> apple heap
it certainly wo n't get there on looks
compared to the <unk> <unk> the exemplar of apple pulchritude the <unk> is decidedly more dowdy generally smaller less - perfectly shaped greenish with tinges of red
to hear most <unk> growers tell it we still be in <unk> if the serpent had proffered one to <unk>
but how sweet it is
it has more sugar than any apple n we ever tested says <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> of <unk> pomologist or apple scholar
it has a long shelf life and does n't fool the public says <unk> <unk> <unk> an <unk> <unk> grower who is planting fujis and spreading the good word about them
it does n't look nice on the outside while getting mealy inside
<unk> <unk> razor sharp at <unk> has picked and packed a zillion pecks of apples over the past <unk> years
he is known as the father of the <unk> <unk> <unk> a radically different apple that the conventional wisdom once said n would never catch on
it did shaking the apple establishment to its roots
now even more radical changes seem afoot as the grand old maverick of american apples plays the role of <unk> <unk>
the <unk> is going to be no . n n to replace the <unk> <unk> he says
the <unk> hegemony wo n't end anytime soon
new apple trees grow slowly and the <unk> <unk> is almost as entrenched as mom
its roots are patriotic with the first trees appearing in <unk> in an orchard near <unk> <unk> to be exact
for more than n years it has been the apple of our eye
a good <unk> can indeed be delicious
more than twice as many <unk> <unk> apples are grown as the <unk> variety <unk> no . n apple
but the apple industry is ripe for change
<unk> <unk> has been overplanted and its prices have dropped below the cost of production says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the scare over <unk> a growth regulator that makes apples redder and crunchier but may be carcinogenic made consumers shy away from the <unk> though they were less affected than the <unk>
the glut and consequent lower prices combined with cancer fears was a very serious blow to growers
a lot of growers wo n't be around in a few years says <unk> <unk> although they have stopped using <unk>
one may be <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> grower
this is beautiful stuff he says looking ruefully at big boxes of just - picked <unk> <unk> next to his barn
but i going to lose n to n on it
i going to have to get another job this year just to eat
besides rotten prices he has been hit recently by hail a bark - nibbling horde of mice fungi and bugs
some n insects and <unk> diseases wiggle chew and romp through growers nightmares including maggots mites mildew thrips black rot and the flat - headed borer
even if a grower beats them back his n rented bees might buzz off to the neighbors orchards instead of pollinating his <unk> <unk> says <unk>
though growers ca n't always keep the worm from the apple they can protect themselves against the price vagaries of any one variety by diversifying into the recently imported <unk> a sweet <unk> <unk> native the <unk> <unk> reportedly <unk> <unk> favorite apple disease - resistant kinds like the <unk>
i ripped out a lot of <unk> and grafted the trees with many different shoots says <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> grower tramping through his <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on a crisp autumn day recently
i got n kinds of apples
here a <unk> he exclaims picking one off a tree
he bites it scowls and throws it down
it a real dog
supermarkets are getting into the variety act too
they still buy apples mainly for big red good looks that why so many taste like woodchucks punching bags
but freshness counts more than it once did and stores are expanding shelf space for unconventional but tastier and often pricier apples
rather than sell <unk> <unk> maybe we can sell n fujis says <unk> <unk> perishables director for <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> supermarket chain and food distributor
the <unk> is a product of meticulous japanese pomological engineering which fostered it n years ago at a government research orchard
japanese researchers have bred dozens of strains of fujis to hone its color taste and shelf life
now the best of them age as gracefully as grannies the industry gold standard for storability
in the cornucopia of go - go apples the <unk> track record stands out during the past <unk> years it has gone from almost zilch to some n of <unk> market
the japanese apple market is very keyed to high quality says <unk> <unk> a scientist at a canadian horticulture research center in <unk> <unk> <unk> and so apples are more of a delicacy there than a big food commodity
the <unk> <unk> of <unk> estimates that this year americans will eat about <unk> more fresh apples per capita than the japanese
the <unk> is still small potatoes in the <unk> sold mainly in fruit boutiques
but in <unk> says <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> - apple grower there a <unk> apple cult
once somebody eats one they get hooked
<unk> <unk> the <unk> grower says that he could sell fujis to <unk> buyers at <unk> a box if he had them
<unk> already is a big importer of fujis from other places he adds n
but his first crop wo n't be picked till next year
i expect to see the demand exceed supply for fujis for the next <unk> to n years he adds
<unk> <unk> <unk> by the way are wholesaling for less than <unk> a box these days
<unk> <unk> sees fujis in part as striking a blow against the perversion of <unk> apples by supermarkets
when the chain stores took over there was no longer a connection between grower and consumer
a guy is sitting up in an office deciding what you going to eat
after all until the n even the <unk> <unk> was a firm delectable morsel
then as growers bred them more for looks and to satisfy supermarket chains demands of long - term storage the <unk> went into decline
now those red applelike things n stores sell in summer are fruitbowl lovely but usually not good eating
they do deserve respect however they are almost a year old probably equal to about <unk> in human years
the <unk> to be sure has blemishes too
it ripens later than most apples and growing it in <unk> areas with chilly autumns may be tricky
moreover the frumpy <unk> must compete with an increasingly dolledup <unk>
<unk> <unk> the <unk> grower says n the big boss at a supermarket chain even rejected his <unk> <unk> recently because they were n't waxed and brushed for extra shine
and he had n't used hormones which many growers employ to elongate their delicious apples for greater eye appeal
still <unk> <unk> points out <unk> grannies became popular without big red looks so why not fujis
he sees a shift in american values at least regarding apples toward more emphasis on substance and less on glitz
taste has finally come to the fore he says
or for that matter the core
<unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> its board increased the number of shares of common stock n to be purchased under a previously authorized program to n million from n million
the maker of engineered materials has acquired more than n million shares under the program
the state attorney general office filed suit against five <unk> <unk> brokerage firms charging them with responsibility for much of a n million loss incurred by the state treasurer office in <unk>

the firms have all said that <unk> <unk> suit is without merit
on <unk> the firms filed a suit against <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> state court asking for a declaratory judgment absolving them of liability
that suit is pending
the suits relate to a n million loss disclosed in <unk> that was suffered by <unk> <unk> consolidated investment pool
the pool invested idle cash for many state agencies and local governments
in its suit the attorney general office alleges that brokers encouraged members of the treasurer office to engage in high - volume high - risk transactions that benefited the brokers
few people are aware that the federal government lends almost as much money as it borrows
from <unk> to n while federal budget deficits totaled n trillion the government issued <unk> billion of new direct loans and an additional n billion of new primary loan guarantees
these figures omit secondary guarantees deposit insurance and the activities of <unk> - <unk> <unk> a huge concern in its own right as detailed on this page <unk> <unk>
federal credit programs date back to the <unk> <unk> and were meant to break even financially
since the <unk> federal lending has experienced extraordinary growth in credit volume subsidy rates and policy applications spurred on by the growth of government in general and budget gimmicks and deceptive management in particular
as we will see many of these obligations do n't show up as part of the federal deficit
but recent events indicate <unk> that federal credit is out of control
student loan defaults remain high at about n and the program has been rocked by allegations of fraud and mismanagement
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> loans have turned into de facto giveaway programs losses over the next three years are expected to exceed n billion
defaults on <unk> <unk> loan guarantees have quadrupled in the past eight years
last month the <unk> <unk> <unk> reported that defaults in <unk> <unk> <unk> guarantees were five times as high as previously estimated and that <unk> equity fell to minus <unk> billion
<unk> findings are particularly troubling because the <unk> has about n billion in obligations outstanding and had previously been considered one of the most financially secure credit programs
scores of other credit programs subsidizing agriculture small business exporters defense energy transportation and others are less visible but in no better shape
if the programs continue their present path the potential government losses are staggering the federal government holds <unk> billion in direct loans outstanding and backs an additional n billion in primary guarantees
secondary guarantees of pools of <unk> and <unk> - backed loans by the agency known as <unk> <unk> currently exceed n billion
although external events have contributed to the morass the principal causes of the current crisis are internal and generic to all programs
to reduce the risks while still retaining the legitimate benefits n these programs can provide credit policy must n <unk> credit to improve the operation of capital markets not to provide subsidies
there is a fundamental conflict between providing a subsidy and maintaining the integrity of a credit program
if the program is meant to provide a subsidy collecting the debt defeats the original goal
thus subsidized loans tend to turn into giveaway programs with increasing subsidy and default rates over time
to avoid this problem government should issue credit only if it intends to use every legal method to collect
in contrast credit programs can be appropriate tools n to improve the operation of capital markets
for example legal restrictions on interstate banking once inhibited the supply of credit to the agricultural sector
farm lending was enacted to correct this problem by providing a reliable flow of lendable funds
however this in no way justifies the huge government subsidies and losses on such loans
credit policy should separate these two competing objectives and eliminate aspects that provide the subsidy
for example student loans currently attempt to subsidize college attendance and mitigate problems created by the fact that students future earnings are not accepted as collateral
the program provides highly subsidized loans to any student whose family earns less than a particular amount
high default rates a low interest rate and government coverage of all interest costs while the student is in school make program costs extremely high
families that do not need the loan can make money simply by putting the loan in the bank and paying it back when the student graduates
in contrast a student loan program that was meant solely to correct capital - market imperfections would allow loans for any student regardless of family income at market or near - market rates
while the student was in school interest costs would either be paid by the student or added to the loan balance
this program combined with cash grants to needy students would reduce program costs and much more effectively target the intended beneficiaries
n provide better incentives
given the structure of most credit programs it is surprising that default rates are not even higher
guarantee rates are typically <unk> giving lenders little reason n to screen customers carefully
reducing those rates moderately say to <unk> would still provide substantial assistance to borrowers
but it would also encourage lenders to choose more creditworthy customers and go a long way toward reducing defaults
for example the <unk> <unk> <unk> has had reasonable success in reducing both guarantee rates and default rates in its <unk> <unk> <unk>
borrowers incentives are equally skewed
since the government has a dismal record of collecting bad debts the costs to the borrower of defaulting are usually low
in addition it is often possible to obtain a new government loan even if existing debts are not paid off
simple policy prescriptions in this case would be to improve debt collection taking the gloves off contracted collection agencies and to deny new credit to defaulters
these provisions would be difficult n to enforce for a program intended to provide a subsidy but would be reasonable and effective devices for programs that attempt to offset market imperfections
n <unk> the true costs of credit programs in the federal budget
since the budget measures cash flow a new <unk> direct loan is treated as a n expenditure even though at least part of the loan will be paid back
loan guarantees do n't appear at all until the borrower defaults so new guarantees do not raise the deficit even though they create future liabilities for the government
by converting an expenditure or loan to a guarantee the government can ensure the same flow of resources and reduce the current deficit
predictably guarantees outstanding have risen by n billion since n while direct loans outstanding have fallen by n billion
the true budgetary cost of a credit subsidy is the discounted value of the net costs to government
this figure could be estimated using techniques employed by private lenders to forecast losses or determined by selling loans to private owners without federal guarantees
neither technique is perfect but both are better than the current system which misstates the costs of new credit programs by amounts that vary substantially and average about n billion annually according to the <unk> <unk> <unk>
a budget that reflected the real costs of lending would eliminate incentives to convert spending or lending programs to guarantees and would let taxpayers know what <unk> is committing them to
n <unk> standard accounting and administrative practices
creative accounting is a hallmark of federal credit
many agencies roll over their debt paying off delinquent loans by issuing new loans or converting defaulted loan guarantees into direct loans
in any case they avoid having to write off the loans
some agencies simply keep bad loans on the books as late as <unk> the <unk> - <unk> <unk> held in its portfolio at face value loans made to <unk> in the n
more seriously <unk> has carried several billion dollars of defaulted loans at face value
until <unk> recent audit <unk> books had not been subject to a complete external audit in <unk> years
the administration of federal credit should closely parallel private lending practices including the development of a loan loss reserve and regular outside audits
establishing these practices would permit earlier identification of emerging financial crises provide better information for loan sales and budgeting decisions and reduce fraud
<unk> lending was not intended to be a way n to obfuscate spending figures hide fraudulent activity or provide large subsidies
the reforms described above would provide a more limited but clearer safer and ultimately more useful role for government as a lender
without such reforms credit programs will continue to be a large - scale high - risk proposition for taxpayers

<unk> <unk> is considering casting a line - item veto as a test n to determine whether the courts will rule that he has such authority
<unk> <unk> has long campaigned for passage of a bill or a constitutional amendment that would explicitly give him a line - item veto which would enable him to kill individual items in a big spending bill without having to kill the entire bill
he has argued that such presidential power is necessary to rein in congressional spending
but some analysts particularly conservative legal scholars have urged <unk> <unk> not to wait for explicit authorization but simply to assert that the <unk> already implicitly gives him the power to exercise a line - item veto
such an assertion most likely would bring about a court challenge from <unk> that would clarify whether a president already has such power
<unk> <unk> spokesman <unk> <unk> confirming comments made this week by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> is interested in finding a suitable test case

the <unk> administration said <unk> it is submitting a comprehensive proposal for overhauling agricultural trade that could help break an impasse in the current round of multilateral trade negotiations
the proposal reiterates the <unk> desire to scrap or reduce a host of trade - distorting subsidies on farm products
but it would allow considerable flexibility in determining how and when these goals would be achieved
the <unk> plan also would ease the transition to freer agriculture trade by allowing some countries to convert non - tariff barriers into tariffs that together with existing tariffs then would be phased out over n years
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who along with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> unveiled the proposal said <unk> she is confident n it will gain considerable support from the <unk> trading partners
<unk> <unk> seeking to allay european objections to an earlier <unk> plan that called for eliminating all farm - trade barriers by the year <unk> said n the new <unk> proposal would n't put farmers out of business but would only encourage them to grow what the markets desire instead of what the government wants
the <unk> is submitting the proposal today in <unk> hoping that the initiative will spur members of the <unk> <unk> on tariffs and <unk> to reach agreement on new trade rules before their current negotiating round concludes in <unk> n
another <unk> proposal filed <unk> urges more fair play in services trade including predictable and clear rules and equality in the treatment of foreign and domestic service companies
unlike the earlier <unk> farm - trade proposal which struck european countries as too extreme the latest plan would provide some room for maneuver
for instance the new <unk> package makes clear n there would be a transition period during which <unk> members could use a combination of tariffs and quotas to cushion their farmers from foreign competition
it also says n countries could temporarily raise tariffs on certain products if they experience an unusually heavy volume of imports
instead of proposing a complete elimination of farm subsidies as the earlier <unk> proposal did the new package calls for the elimination of only the most tradedistorting ones
less objectionable ones would be subject only to some restraints and others with a relatively minor trade impact would be allowed to continue under certain conditions
the new <unk> plan also would establish procedures <unk> to prevent countries from using health and sanitation rules to impede trade arbitrarily
the goal would be to resolve disputes such as one prompted by the <unk> <unk> current attempt to bar imports of beef from hormone - treated <unk> cattle
the <unk> contends that the rules are n't justified on health grounds
to encourage more competition among exporting countries the <unk> is proposing that export subsidies including tax incentives for exporters be phased out in five years

the <unk> rights <unk> of <unk> was enacted to keep the promise of the <unk> <unk> and enable southern blacks to go to the polls unhindered by literacy tests and other exclusionary devices
twenty - five years later the <unk> rights <unk> has been transformed by the courts and the <unk> <unk> into a program of racial gerrymandering designed to increase the number of blacks and other minorities hispanics asians and native americans holding elective office
in the <unk> the <unk> <unk> and lower federal courts that enforce the <unk> rights <unk> have required state legislatures and municipal governments to create the maximum number of safe minority election districts districts where minorities form between <unk> and <unk> of the voting population
the program has even been called upon to create safe white electoral districts in municipalities where whites are the minority
although <unk> n of the act expressly disclaims requiring that minorities win a proportional share of elective offices few municipal and state government plans achieve preclearance by the <unk> <unk> or survive the scrutiny of the lower federal courts unless they carve out as many solidly minority districts as possible
the new goal of the <unk> rights <unk> more minorities in political office is laudable
for the political process to work all citizens regardless of race must feel represented
one essential indicator that they are is that members of minority groups get elected to public office with reasonable frequency
as is blacks constitute n of the population but fewer than <unk> of elected leaders
but racial gerrymandering is not the best way n to accomplish that essential goal
it is a quick fix for a complex problem
far from promoting a commonality of interests among black white hispanic and other minority voters drawing the district lines according to race suggests that race is the voter and the candidate most important trait
such a policy implies that only a black politician can speak for a black person and that only a white politician can govern on behalf of a white one
examples of the divisive effects of racial gerrymandering can be seen in two cities <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
when they reapportion their districts after the <unk> census every other municipality and state in the country will face this issue
<unk> <unk> <unk>
racial gerrymandering has been a familiar policy in <unk> <unk> <unk> since <unk> when <unk> first amended the <unk> rights <unk> to expand its reach beyond the southern states
in <unk> the <unk> <unk> required that the electoral map in the borough of <unk> be redrawn to concentrate black and hispanic votes despite protests that the new electoral boundaries would split a neighborhood of hasidic jews into two different districts
this year a commission appointed by the mayor to revise <unk> <unk> system of government completed a new charter expanding the <unk> <unk> to <unk> from n members
sometime in <unk> as soon as the <unk> census becomes available a redistricting panel will redraw the <unk> <unk> district lines
the <unk> <unk> <unk> has made it clear that in response to the expectations of the <unk> <unk> and the commission own commitment to enhancing minority political leadership the new district lines will be drawn to maximize the number of solidly minority districts
blacks and hispanics currently make up n of the city population and hold only n of the seats on the council
several of the city black leaders including democratic mayoral nominee <unk> <unk> have spoken out for racial gerrymandering n to accord blacks and hispanics the fullest opportunity for representation
in this connection it is important to note that several members of <unk> <unk> sitting <unk> <unk> represent heterogeneous districts that bring together sizable black hispanic and non - hispanic white populations <unk> <unk> <unk> district in northern <unk> and the south <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> district in <unk> for example
to win their seats on the council these political leaders have had to listen to all the voices in their district and devise public policies that would benefit all
often they have found that the relevant issue is not race but rather housing crime prevention or education
<unk> <unk>
the unusual situation in <unk> vividly illustrates the divisive consequences of carving out safe districts for racial minorities
in <unk> which is n black whites are the minority
insisting that they are protected by the <unk> rights <unk> a group of whites brought a federal suit in <unk> to demand that the city abandon at - large voting for the nine member <unk> <unk> and create nine electoral districts including four safe white districts
the white group argued that whites were not fully and fairly represented because in city - wide elections only black candidates or white candidates who catered to black interests could win
no federal court has ruled that the <unk> rights <unk> protects a white minority but in <unk> the <unk> <unk> approved a districting plan for <unk> that carves out three white - majority districts and six black - majority districts
<unk> <unk> <unk> black mayor lamented the consequences
in the past people who had to run for office had to moderate their views because they could n't afford to offend blacks or whites he said
now you go to districts you likely to get candidates whose views are more extreme white and black on racial issues
two hundred years ago critics of the new <unk> <unk> <unk> warned that the electoral districts for <unk> were too large and encompassed too many different economic interests
a small farmer and a seaport merchant could not be represented by the same spokesman they said n
but <unk> <unk> refuted that argument in one of the most celebrated political treatises ever written no . n of the <unk> <unk>
<unk> explained that a representative duty was to speak not for the narrow interests of one group but instead for the common good
large heterogeneous election districts would encourage good government said <unk> <unk> because a representative would be compelled to serve the interests of all his constituents and be servile to none
<unk> noble and unifying vision of the representative still can guide us
as long as we believe that all americans of every race and ethnic background have common interests and can live together cooperatively our political map should reflect our belief
racial gerrymandering creating separate black and white districts says that we have discarded that belief in our ability to live together and govern ourselves as one people
<unk> <unk> is a constitutional scholar at the <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> in <unk> <unk>
the <unk> <unk> has distributed these new guidelines for <unk> <unk> prosecuting <unk> cases
a related editorial appears today
under <unk> the government may seek a temporary restraining order tro upon the filing of a <unk> indictment in order to preserve all forfeitable assets until the trial is completed and judgment entered
such orders can have a wide - ranging impact on third parties who do business with the defendants including clients vendors banks investors creditors dependents and others
some highly publicized cases involving <unk> tros have been the subject of considerable criticism in the press because of a perception that pre - trial freezing of assets is tantamount to a seizure of property without due process
in order to ensure that the rights of all interested parties are protected the <unk> <unk> has instituted the following requirements to control the use of tros in <unk> prosecutions
it should be noted that these requirements are in addition to any other existing requirements such as review by the <unk> <unk> <unk>
n as part of the approval process for <unk> prosecutions the prosecutor must submit any proposed forfeiture tro for review by the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
the prosecutor must show that less - intrusive remedies such as bonds are not likely to preserve the assets for forfeiture in the event of a conviction
n in seeking approval of a tro the prosecutor must articulate any anticipated impact that forfeiture and the tro would have on innocent third parties balanced against the government need to preserve the assets
n in deciding whether forfeiture and hence a tro is appropriate the section will consider the nature and severity of the offense the government policy is not to seek the fullest forfeiture permissible under the law where that forfeiture would be disproportionate to the defendant crime
n when a <unk> tro is being sought the prosecutor is required at the earliest appropriate time to state publicly that the government request for a tro and eventual forfeiture is made in full recognition of the rights of third parties that is in requesting the tro the government will not seek to disrupt the normal legitimate business activities of the defendant will not seek through use of the relation - back doctrine to take from third parties assets legitimately transferred to them will not seek to vitiate legitimate business transactions occurring between the defendant and third parties and will in all other respects assist the court in ensuring that the rights of third parties are protected through proceeding under <unk> and otherwise
the <unk> expects that the prosecutor will announce these principles either at the time n the indictment is returned or at the latest at the first proceeding before the court concerning the tro
sales of <unk> <unk> - built cars and trucks plunged n in mid - <unk> from a year earlier as domestic manufacturers paid the price for heavy incentives earlier this year
people are waiting for new factory giveaways said <unk> <unk> sales manager of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> whose sales are slow
this trend appears to be especially true at <unk> <unk> <unk> which used both dealer and consumer incentives to ignite sales in <unk> and <unk>
since then deliveries have slumped
<unk> car sales dropped <unk> in mid - <unk> to n while truck sales fell <unk> to n
<unk> also had dismal results in the first <unk> days of the month while other auto makers reported mixed results
all of the <unk> three suffered in the just - ended period however with sales of all domestically made cars including those built at <unk> - managed plants falling <unk> to <unk> from a year earlier
the seasonal adjusted annual selling rate was six million vehicles a small improvement from the n million rate of early <unk> but a big drop from the n million rate a year ago
sales of domestically made trucks also continued to be sluggish in mid - <unk> dropping n to n from a year ago
the <unk> <unk> auto makers already have slashed fourth - quarter production plans n below year - ago levels but that may not be enough to prevent inventories from ballooning if sales do n't improve
industry analyst <unk> <unk> <unk> a vice president with <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> forecasts that domestic auto makers will have a <unk> supply of cars at the end of the year even if car sales improve to a n million vehicle rate for the quarter
<unk> <unk> <unk> reported a n drop in sales of domestic - made cars to <unk> and a n drop in domestic trucks to <unk>
the sales are being dragged down by a glut of <unk> vehicles said <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> analyst
the earlier use of incentives depleted the market of scavengers for bargain - basement n cars he said n
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> still needs to move about <unk> n cars and trucks
business had been fairly strong until <unk> <unk> hit the area but has been down since
<unk> <unk> also hit the rocks in mid - <unk>
the no . n <unk> auto maker had a n plunge in car sales to <unk> and a n drop in truck sales to n which include its minivans and jeeps
<unk> <unk> <unk> which continues to have short supplies of domestically made accords saw its sales of <unk> <unk> - built cars fall <unk> to n
but sales of domestic cars and trucks at <unk> <unk> <unk> rose <unk> to n
a <unk> spokesman attributed the increase to the use of incentives this year and not a year ago and to higher fleet sales
<unk> <unk> <unk> which opened a plant in <unk> <unk> last year saw sales triple to <unk> vehicles
a totals include only vehicle sales reported in the period
c domestic
d percent change greater than <unk>
x there were n selling days in the most recent period and <unk> a year earlier
percentage differences based on daily sales rate rather than sales volume
short interest in <unk> over - the-counter stocks rose <unk> as of mid - <unk> its biggest jump since <unk> last <unk>
the most recent <unk> short interest statistics were compiled <unk> n the day n the <unk> composite index slid <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> tumbled n
the coincidence might lead to the conclusion that short - sellers bet heavily on that day that <unk> stocks would decline further
as it happens the <unk> composite did continue to fall for two days after the initial plunge
however the short interest figures reported by brokerage and securities clearing firms to the <unk> <unk> of securities dealers include only those trades completed or settled by <unk> n rather than trades that occurred on that day according to <unk> <unk> chief economist for the <unk>
generally it takes five business days to transfer stock and to take the other steps necessary to settle a trade
the total short interest in <unk> stocks as of mid - <unk> was n million shares up from n million in <unk> but well below the record level of n million shares established in <unk> <unk>
the sharp rise in <unk> short interest compares with the <unk> decline in short interest on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> rise on the <unk> <unk> <unk> during the <unk> - <unk> period
generally a short seller expects a fall in a stock price and aims to profit by selling borrowed shares that are to be replaced later the short seller hopes n the replacement shares bought later will cost less than those that were sold
short interest which represents the number of shares borrowed and sold but not yet replaced can be a bad - expectations barometer for many stocks
among <unk> of the largest <unk> issues short interest rose to n million shares from n million in <unk> stocks in <unk>
big stocks with large short interest gains as of <unk> n included <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
short interest in <unk> <unk> an insurance issue rose <unk> to n million
<unk> short interest jumped n while <unk> increased <unk>
<unk> makes semiconductors and <unk> operates department - store chains and is strained for cash
<unk> <unk> again had the dubious honor of being the <unk> stock with the biggest short interest position on <unk>
<unk> has headed the list since <unk>
<unk> <unk> and troubled <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> were next in line
short selling is n't necessarily bad for the overall market
shorted shares must eventually be replaced through buying
in addition changes in short interest in some stocks may be caused by arbitrage
for example an investor may seek to profit during some takeover situations by buying stock in one company involved and shorting the stock of the other
two big stocks involved in takeover activity saw their short interest surge
short interest in the american depositary receipts of <unk> the target of both <unk> <unk> and <unk> motors more than doubled
<unk> stocks that showed a drop in short interest included <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> shares of <unk> - <unk> and takeover targets <unk> and <unk>
the <unk> which operates the <unk> computer system on which <unk> <unk> issues trade compiles short interest data in two categories the approximately two - thirds and generally biggest <unk> stocks that trade on the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the one - third and generally smaller <unk> stocks that are n't a part of the system
short interest in <unk> non - <unk> securities totaled n million shares compared with almost n million shares in <unk> issues in <unk>
the <unk> short interest represents <unk> days of average daily trading volume in the smaller stocks in the system for the reporting period compared with n day a month ago
among bigger <unk> stocks the figures represent n days of average daily volume compared with n days in <unk>
the adjacent tables show the issues in which a short interest position of at least n shares existed as of <unk> n or in which there was a short position change of at least n shares since <unk> n see accompanying tables <unk> <unk> n <unk>
from the <unk> <unk> <unk> issue of the <unk>
what defeated <unk> <unk> was not only the weight of the syrian army
the weight of <unk> history was also against him and it is a history n <unk> is in danger of repeating
like <unk> and however unfairly <unk> is regarded by the arab world as a colonial aberration
its best hope of acceptance by its neighbours lies in reaching a settlement with the palestinians
like <unk> <unk> is being remade by demography
in <unk> <unk> more than half the children under six are muslims
within <unk> years jews will probably be the minority
yet <unk> will neither share power with all these arabs nor says n its present prime minister redraw its borders closer to its <unk> jewish heartland
by not choosing one of these options israelis will condemn themselves as the maronites did to perpetual war with the muslims in their midst and so to the internal erosion of their state
unlike the maronites <unk> jews will not let themselves become the weakest force in a system of private armies <unk> will become <unk> before it becomes <unk>
but that is not much of a consolation n to draw from the failure of <unk> <unk>
the <unk> over - the-counter market did n't fully recover from a selling stampede and closed down n
the effects on the market of the mostly computer - driven sell - off among exchange - listed stocks irked many market makers who watched the <unk> <unk> <unk> tumble in sympathy with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and then saw it get left behind in the subsequent rally
after plummeting n at one point during the day the composite rebounded a little but finished down n at n
in contrast the industrial average recovered almost completely from its skid and closed down n
the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> lower for the day
as usual the over - the-counter market biggest technology stocks were hardest hit
<unk> battered by profit taking in recent sessions sank as much as <unk> but it finished at <unk> <unk> down <unk> <unk> on volume of one million shares
<unk> communications the most active issue finished down <unk> to <unk> <unk>
<unk> traded as low as <unk> <unk> during the session
other active stocks included <unk> whose american depositary receipts added <unk> to <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> improved <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> slipped <unk> to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> was up <unk> to <unk> <unk>
the market started with several strikes against it said <unk> <unk> head of retail equity trading at <unk> <unk> <unk> referring to news that the labor - management buy - out of <unk> <unk> continued to unravel and reports that the junk - bond market is disintegrating
but the computer - guided selling in response to those developments dealt a serious blow to the over - the-counter market <unk> <unk> said <unk>
even though the over - the-counter market usually does n't fall by as much as listed stocks during program - selling blitzes he said n when the market does recover the damage is done and it leaves <unk> down more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> also complained that the sharp swings in stock prices lately is scaring away retail and foreign investors
while <unk> does n't do computer - guided program trading for its own account the firm does execute orders for clients involved in the buying and selling of shares tied to movements in certain stock indexes <unk> <unk> acknowledged <unk>
the volatility inherent in program trading troubled other traders too
they do n't like the risks n they are forced to assume when prices swing so drastically
market makers are supposed to keep supplies of stocks on hand to maintain orderly trading when imbalances occur
that means that on days when prices are tumbling and sellers abound they must be willing to buy shares from sellers when no one else will
in such an environment a market maker can absorb huge losses
but the recent volatility in stock prices caused by the program trading has made some market makers less willing to soak up the stocks that are for sale
the market makers say n they are n't comfortable carrying big positions in stocks because they realize n prices can tumble quickly
the situation makes it harder to buy and sell shares quickly exacerbating the rise and fall in stock prices during program - dominated trading
groused <unk> <unk> head of over - the-counter trading at <unk> <unk> <unk> it making it tough for traders to make money
he said that when sell programs kick in many traders believe that there no sense in sticking your nose out because you an instant loser
<unk> - <unk> <unk> centers added <unk> to <unk> <unk> on n shares
<unk> <unk> said n it will make a n offer for the remaining <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> common stock if it acquires a majority of the company shares in a pending rights offering by <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> parent <unk> - <unk> <unk>
shares of <unk> <unk> closed at <unk> <unk> also up <unk> on volume of <unk>

the company posted third - quarter earnings of n cents a share down from <unk> a year earlier
the company estimated that losses from <unk> <unk> reduced net income by n cents a share in the most recent quarter
the company said n losses from the <unk> <unk> earthquake in <unk> have n't yet been determined but that it provides earthquake coverage to about <unk> properties in the stricken area
any quake - related losses will be reported in the fourth quarter the company said n

the electronics - instruments maker is to be acquired by <unk> <unk> associates for <unk> a share

the company said <unk> the latest quarter included about n million in special legal and financial advisory costs related to <unk> <unk> <unk> bid for the company and <unk> merger pact with <unk>
<unk> was unchanged at <unk>
<unk> slid <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> amid continuing concerns about the company contract negotiations with <unk> <unk> machines
<unk> is reviewing its entire business - partners program and <unk> confirmed earlier this month that it was in talks with the company about possible modifications to its current <unk> - remarketer contract
remarketers make modifications to <unk> computer hardware and resell the products
<unk> <unk> <unk> surged <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk>
the company said <unk> net rose to n cents a share in its fiscal - first quarter ended <unk> n from n cents a shares a year ago
probably the most clear - cut soviet violation for example is the <unk> radar
arms control reality <unk> n <unk> the first of some <unk> <unk> editorials saying that <unk> violated the <unk> treaty
whether the installation is for early warning or space track it clearly is not deployed the lawmakers said
thus we judge it to be not a violation of the <unk> treaty at this time
the delegation included a reporter from the <unk> <unk> <unk> aides to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> resources <unk> <unk> staff members
the <unk> <unk> <unk> n <unk>
the <unk> has taken unprecedented unilateral measures of openness by giving american representatives a possibility to inspect the building site of the <unk> radar as well as radar vans in the areas of <unk> and <unk> so as to see for themselves that there are no violations of the <unk> treaty of <unk> on the part of the <unk> <unk>
letter from <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> reported in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the construction of this station equal in size to the egyptian pyramids constituted i say it n directly a clear violation of <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
we happy we guess to receive confirmation of the <unk> violation from the soviets five years after we started writing about it
perhaps even the american apologists will now accede
without question something intriguing is going on in the policy chambers of the <unk>
as it bids for new agreements new loans and indeed admission to the civilized world the soviet government has recognized <unk> it has a credibility problem
so after n years it is confessing the obvious hoping to be believed about other things
it not enough
if the soviets want to be believed they need to start telling the truth about more than the totally obvious
our own test of glasnost authenticity would be a soviet decision to open itself to a complete international examination of one of the most troubling mysteries in u.s.-soviet relations the reported <unk> anthrax outbreak at a soviet military facility in <unk>
the <unk> government has never waivered in its assessment of this incident as an accident at a biological weapons facility there and hence a violation of the <unk> <unk> weapons <unk>
the <unk> recently issued <unk> <unk> <unk> though in general adopting a softer line repeated the <unk> assessment
it also was detailed in congressional testimony this past <unk> an explosion at the <unk> and <unk> <unk> in <unk> released anthrax germs that caused a significant number of deaths
since <unk> <unk> did not address this topic before the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> official position remains that the anthrax deaths were caused by tainted meat
we doubt this claim just as we doubted <unk> <unk> assurance last year that <unk> did n't violate the <unk> treaty
and just as we did not believe the tendentious claims of the congressmen and arms - control advocates who visited <unk> we are in no way persuaded by the assent to the tainted - meat theory by a <unk> team of scientists who met with soviet counterparts in <unk> last year
the soviets explanation is that the anthrax came from one lot of animal feed made from the bones of cattle that grazed on soil that was naturally infected with anthrax spores
<unk> <unk> <unk> who we read <unk> has sold something called the scientific community on the notion that yellow rain attacks on the laotian <unk> were in fact the result of fecal showers by giant bees found the soviet anthrax scenario completely plausible
we do n't believe it
and we certainly do not believe that <unk> <unk> or any of his emissaries yet deserve to have the <unk> take their word for it
<unk> is a large gray cloud over glasnost and indeed over the legitimacy of the arms - control process itself
the <unk> government <unk> complaint as with <unk> is no mere political posturing
biological weapons violations have figured little in political debate and indeed have not been pressed vigorously enough by the <unk> government
but the stated <unk> position is detailed and specific and the prospect of biological warfare is profoundly chilling
the soviets should be willing to set in motion a process that would allow them to acknowledge that <unk> violated the <unk> agreement or alternatively that would give <unk> specialists reasonable confidence that this was a wholly civilian accident
until that happens glasnost can not begin to deserve the kind of credibility <unk> <unk> <unk> was bidding for with his confessions on <unk>
<unk> <unk> said <unk> it offered to buy <unk> million of its convertible preferred stock from the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a move that would improve the trust liquidity and reduce the potential number of <unk> shares outstanding
<unk> said n it made the offer within the past several weeks as part of an effort to improve shareholder value
it said n it would purchase the stock at market price
<unk> and a spokeswoman for the trust said that the two are discussing the proposal but a decision has n't been made
we are considering that offer along with all other alternatives the trust spokeswoman said
we need to look at how to maximize our cash flow to pay our beneficiaries
the trust created as part of <unk> bankruptcy - law reorganization to compensate victims of asbestos - related diseases owns n million of the <unk> <unk> convertible preferred shares which are each convertible into <unk> <unk> common shares
the trust also owns half of <unk> n million common shares outstanding
based on <unk> closing price yesterday of <unk> a share <unk> offer would purchase about n million of its preferred shares or about <unk> of the trust preferred stock holding
in addition to the stock and n of <unk> profits beginning in <unk> the trust is supposed to receive n billion over its n life
but it initially was funded with about n million and may soon face a cash crunch
as of <unk> <unk> it had settled about <unk> of <unk> claims filed and its unpaid claims totaled n million a large portion of its n million in cash and marketable securities
since most of its assets are tied to <unk> a forest and building products concern the trust might also want to diversify its holdings
as part of its offer <unk> said <unk> it requested changes in some covenants between it and the trust to allow <unk> to reflect a more typical corporate ownership and financial structure
a <unk> spokesman would n't elaborate on the proposed changes
but he said n they are to a large degree housekeeping although some may generate some disagreement
<unk> said n the shares issued to the trust were intended to be sold as needed and that <unk> has the right of first refusal to buy those shares
<unk> <unk> raised its bid for <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> which is operating under <unk> <unk> protection to n billion from n billion
<unk> raised bid which was supported by <unk> of <unk> <unk> official shareholder committee is a prelude to what is expected to be a round of higher bids by the other groups trying to acquire the company the largest utility in <unk> <unk>
the n billion value claimed by <unk> based in <unk> <unk> is the highest yet given to a bid
some of the three other bidding groups are expected to increase their offers tomorrow a date set for revised offers by a bankruptcy court judge
a hearing is set for <unk> <unk> but participants do n't expect a resolution until <unk> <unk>
under the new <unk> <unk> plan it would pay n billion in cash to creditors and assume n million in pollution control bonds
secured creditors would recover both principal and interest while unsecured creditors would receive only principal and interest accrued before <unk> of <unk> <unk> filed for <unk> <unk> protection in
the biggest change in <unk> offer was in improvements made for equity holders who had been given short shrift previously
assuming full operation of the <unk> nuclear power plant which is completed but is n't yet operating equity holders would receive up to n million in cash preferred stock and new <unk> <unk> bonds
<unk> previous offer had proposed that equity holders receive just n million
in addition <unk> promised the <unk> of <unk> <unk> that rate increases would be limited to <unk> annually for seven years
its previous proposal had conditioned rate limits on <unk> operations and other contingencies
<unk> <unk> financial adviser to the equity holders said given the state strong bargaining position we believe <unk> the <unk> plan provides the best recovery available to <unk> of <unk> <unk> equity holders
officials of <unk> of <unk> <unk> could n't be reached for comment
the company has filed an internal reorganization plan n it valued at n billion that would require n rate increases
that plan would leave existing preferred shareholders with at least a <unk> stake and give common shareholders as little as n
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has proposed buying the company for n billion as part of a plan that would require rate increases of only n annually for seven years
the state of <unk> <unk> has favored that plan
the other bidder is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a bid valued at n billion and and a proposal for seven years of n rate increases
the polish rat will eat well this winter
tons of delectably rotting potatoes barley and wheat will fill damp barns across the land as thousands of farmers turn the state buyers away
many a piglet wo n't be born as a result and many a ham will never hang in a butcher shop
but with inflation raging grain in the barn will still be a safer bet for the private farmer than money in the bank
once again the indomitable peasant holds <unk> future in his hands
until his labor can produce a profit in this dying and distorted system even <unk> sympathetic new government wo n't win him over
in coming months emergency food aid moving in from the <unk> will be the one buffer between a meat - hungry public and a new political calamity
factory workers on strike knocked <unk> communist bosses off balance last year this year it was the farmers who brought them down
in <unk> farmers held onto meat milk and grain waiting for <unk> usual state - directed price rises
the communists froze prices instead
the farmers ran a boycott and meat disappeared from the shops
on <unk> n the state tore up its controls and food prices leaped
without buffer stocks inflation exploded
that was when the tame old <unk> <unk> desperate to live through the crisis broke ranks with the communists and joined with <unk> in the <unk> <unk> first liberated government
but by the time <unk> <unk> took office in <unk> the damage was done
shortageflation as economists have come to call it had gone hyper
the cost of raising a pig kept bounding ahead of the return for selling one
the farmers stayed angry
they still are
at dawn on a cool day hundreds travel to the private market in <unk> a town not far from <unk> hauling pigs cattle and sacks of feed that the state official buyers ca n't induce them to sell
here they are searching for a higher price
in a crush of trucks and horse carts on the trodden field <unk> <unk> wrestles a screeching overweight hog into the trunk of a private butcher polish <unk>
of course it better to sell private he says as the butcher trundles away
why should anybody want to sell to them
the young farmer makes money on the few hogs n he sells here
he wo n't for long because his old state sources of rye and potatoes are drying up
there no feed he says
you ca n't buy anything nowadays
i do n't know why
<unk> <unk> does
his truck is parked across the field in a row of grain sellers
like the others it is loaded with rye wheat and oats in sacks labeled <unk> <unk> in <unk>
the farmer at the next truck shouts <unk>
it nice
it wo n't be cheaper
we sell direct
a heavy kerchiefed woman runs a handful through her fingers and counts him out a pile of zlotys
country people breed pigs says <unk> <unk> leaning against the back of his truck
they ca n't buy feed from the state
there is n't enough
some state middlemen come to buy from me
i sell a little
i am waiting
i have plenty more at home
on this morning he does n't sell much in <unk> either
at closing time farmers cart out most of what they carted in
a private market like this just is n't big enough to absorb all that business
the hulk of <unk> it seems n will not quickly crumble away
state monopolies will keep on stifling trade free prices or not until something else replaces them
polish agriculture will need a whole private network of procurement processing and distribution plus a new manufacturing industry n to supply it with tractors pesticides fertilizers and feed
the communists spent n years working to ensure that no such capitalistic structures ever arose here
building them now will require undergirding from the <unk> and removal of political deadwood a job that <unk> has barely started
but polish agriculture does possess one great asset already the private farmer
we are dealing with real entrepreneurs says <unk> <unk> an economist who advises <unk> <unk> the union countryside offshoot
there are a lot of them and they have property
polish peasants spurning the collectivizers were once a source of shame to orthodox communists
now among communist reformers they are objects of envy
food is the reformer top priority the key to popular support
as the chinese have shown and the soviets are learning family farms thrive where collectives fail
ownership it seems <unk> is the best fertilizer
the poles have had it all along
<unk> n million small private farms cover <unk> of its arable land
on it a quarter of the country n million people produce three - quarters of its grain beef eggs and milk and nine - tenths of its fruit vegetables and potatoes
like the <unk> <unk> <unk> the polish peasant is a pillar of the nation
try as they might the communists could neither replace nor break him
and they did try
a few miles past <unk> a dirt road narrows to a track of sand and leads into <unk> a village of tumbledown farms
<unk> <unk> owns <unk> acres in n scattered scraps
he grows rye and potatoes for a few hens five cows and n piglets
in patched pants and torn shoes he stands in his barnyard eyeing the ground with a look both helpless and sardonic
it bad soil he says
until <unk> it was good soil
then the state put in a reservoir to supply the area with drinking water
farmers lay down before the bulldozers
their protest was ignored
the dam caused the water level to drop in <unk>
<unk> <unk> smiles and his brow furrows
he expected as much
in his lifetime n years the communists brought electricity to his village and piped in drinking water from the reservoir
no phones
no gas
we wanted them to build a road here he says
they started and then abandoned it
a tractor his only mechanized equipment stands in front of the pigsty
it russian
good for nothing
parts are a tragedy
even if i had a lot of money i could n't buy what i need
the farmer can say the same for coal cement saw blades
in <unk> only n of all investment goes toward making things n farmers want in the <unk> it is closer to <unk>
the few big state farms take first crack at what does get made
they use <unk> more fertilizer per acre twice the high - grade feed
yet their best boast is that they produce n of polish pork
i heard from friends that state farms are subsidized <unk> <unk> says as his wife <unk> sets some chairs out in the sun
we have one near here
there is a lot of waste
a private farmer never wastes anything
the state quit shoving peasants onto its subsidized farms over n years ago
but it never did let up on the pressure
until recently a farmer with no heir had to will the state his land to collect his pension
the pension size still depends on how much produce he sells the state
his allotment of materials also did until the state could n't hold up its end of that bargain
yet the state alone sells seeds and machines
when supplies are short it often hands them over only in exchange for milk or grain
a private farmer in <unk> is free to buy and sell land hire help decide what to grow and how to grow it
he is free to invest in chickens and to fail for lack of chicken wire
he has plenty of freedom but no choices
i on my own land <unk> <unk> says
i do n't have to listen to what anybody tells me to do
sometimes says his wife we happy about that
by starving the peasant the communists have starved <unk>
villages like <unk> exist in a desert of poor schools and few doctors
farm income is n below the average
the young leave especially girls who wo n't milk cows by hand
some men stay their best friend a bottle of vodka but two million acres have gone fallow
without machines good farms ca n't get bigger
so the potato crop once n million tons is down to n million
meat consumption is at <unk> level pork production at <unk> milk output at <unk>
if a food crisis undid the communists a food revolution will make <unk>
the potential is displayed along every road into <unk> row upon row of greenhouses stretching out behind modern mansions that trumpet their owners wealth
vegetables are abundant and full of flavor in <unk> the pickles and sauerkraut sublime the state monopolies long broken
grain milk and meat come next
a private challenge to the monolithic tractor industry will take more time and money than <unk> can spare although a smokehouse or a local dairy can spring up fast
<unk> makes no machinery for a plant on that scale
<unk> wants it from the <unk>
<unk> <unk> one of its farm experts lays it on the line the <unk> <unk> will be brought in to help us destroy the old system
<unk> <unk> is destroying it now
he packs pork
a law went on the books in <unk> that let him smoke bacon without breeding pigs
he cashed in
<unk> is short on enterprises not enterprise
i pay a lot to the farmer and five times the state salary to my employees he says
he is in <unk> to open a shop
i hire transportation and my customers have fresh cold cuts every day
i do n't subsidize anyone
everyone around me lives well
yes my prices are high
if nobody buys i bring my prices down
that the rule
that the market
<unk> <unk> is making a fortune <unk> a month he says n
he has bought some trendy western clothes and a green <unk> with an american flag in the window
but the meat - processing machines n he picked up are n years old
i do n't want expensive machines
if the situation changes i get stuck with them
that politics
by taking power in a deal with the <unk> <unk> onetime communist stooges <unk> has spooked the rural entrepreneur
rural <unk> objected to no avail when <unk> leader <unk> <unk> accepted the peasants support
it objected again in <unk> when <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> reluctantly named a <unk> <unk> man as his agriculture minister
both the peasants and <unk> <unk> are forming new political parties for farmers
the peasants can make a credible case against <unk> that hell - bent reform will drive millions from the land
next <unk> the two will battle in local elections
but until then and probably long afterward the communists apparat of obstruction from the head of the dairy co - op to the village bank manager will stay planted in the polish countryside
we know how to get from capitalism to socialism <unk> <unk> is saying one afternoon
we do n't know how to get from socialism to capitalism
he farms n acres in <unk> two miles from the soviet border in one of <unk> poorest places
now he is mounting the steps of a stucco building in a nearby village on a visit to the communist administrator the naczelnik
many people in <unk> hope <unk> this government will break down says <unk> <unk> who belongs to the local council and to <unk> <unk>
that what the naczelnik counts on
he is our most dangerous enemy
every time n he sees me he gets very nervous
the farmer barges into the naczelnik office
a thin man in a gray suit looks up from a newspaper
<unk> <unk> sits
<unk> <unk> leg begins jiggling beneath his desk
<unk> does n't care for the good of this region he says after a few pleasantries
they want to turn everything upside down in a week
<unk> <unk> here wants n acres used at the moment by a state farm
he ca n't guarantee that he can use it any better
i am ready at any moment to compete with a state farm
the naczelnik averts his eyes
what have you got
not even a tractor
and you want to make wicker baskets too
i can do five things at once to be a businessman
big business <unk> <unk> snorts in <unk>
the farmer stands to go
the naczelnik stands too
i care very much for this post he says
eight years i had it
a cultural center has been built shops
suddenly i am not a comfortable man for <unk>
i have accomplished too much
they want to do more
i wish them all the best
the farmer leaves
and the naczelnik shuts his door
the <unk> approved a short - term spending bill <unk> to keep the government operating through <unk> <unk> and provide n billion in emergency funds to assist in the recovery from <unk> <unk> and the <unk> earthquake
the <unk> roll call vote reflected broad support for the disaster assistance but the cost to the <unk> is sure to aggravate budget pressures this year and next under the <unk> - <unk> deficit reduction law
by a lopsided <unk> margin the chamber rejected an effort to waive <unk> - <unk> for purposes of addressing the two disasters and budget analysts estimate <unk> the increased appropriations will widen the fiscal n deficit by at least n billion unless offsetting spending cuts or new revenues are found by <unk>
the budget impact will be greater still in fiscal <unk> and the issue forced a confrontation between the <unk> <unk> leadership and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> whose <unk> district was at the center of the earthquake last week
going to the well of the chamber <unk> <unk> demanded <unk> the costs be fully counted
his prominent role put him in the awkward position of challenging the very committee members on whom his state will be most dependent in the months ahead
we do not come to this <unk> asking for any handout said the <unk> <unk>
we do not intend to hide these costs from the american people
the n billion package incorporates n million for low - interest disaster loans n billion in highway construction funds and n billion divided between general emergency assistance and a reserve n to be available to <unk> <unk> to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters
the funds are in addition to n billion appropriated last month to assist in the recovery from <unk> bringing the total for the two disasters to nearly n billion in unanticipated spending
because of the vagaries of <unk> - <unk> the immediate impact is relatively small
but the appropriations set in motion spending that adds to an already grim budget picture for fiscal <unk>
within the appropriations process the situation is even more difficult since the costs will be counted against the share of funds <unk> to be allocated to those subcommittees that recently have had the greatest difficulty in staying within the budget
the underlying bill approved yesterday is required to keep the government operating past midnight tonight and this urgency has contributed to the speed and critics say <unk> mistakes that have accompanied the package of disaster assistance
the hastily drafted measure could hurt <unk> by requiring it to put up more matching funds for emergency highway assistance than otherwise would be required
and the state delegation is fearful that the new funding will be counted against a separate n million in federal highway funds n it would expect to receive under its normal allocation this year
also the high price of <unk> <unk> real estate puts the state at odds with federal regulations more attuned to the national average
for example disaster loans which will go to small businesses and homeowners offer credit as low as n in some cases
but the <unk> <unk> delegation finds itself asking that the cap per household be lifted to <unk> from <unk> to assist the hard hit but often wealthy <unk> district
the <unk> is expected to make some modifications today but both the <unk> <unk> and <unk> appear most anxious to speed final approval before tonight deadline
administration pressure discourages any effort to add to total funding and the <unk> changes are expected to be largely technical dealing with highway aid and lifting the ceiling on total <unk> <unk> <unk> loans to n billion to accommodate the increased activity expected
yesterday floor action came as a <unk> - <unk> conference approved a nearly n billion fiscal n military construction bill representing a n reduction from last year and making severe cuts from <unk> requests for installations abroad
an estimated n million is allocated to continue work in <unk>
but all funding is cut for the philippines and projects in <unk> <unk> are cut to n million or less than a sixth of the administration request
closer to home the negotiators were more generous
an estimated n million was set aside for military installations in the home state of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> chairman
and <unk> million would go to projects in <unk> represented by his <unk> counterpart and fellow <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> and <unk> are traditionally powerful within the conference but equally striking is the dominance of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> because of their power elsewhere in the appropriations process
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> even added report language listing n million in projects n he wants in the budget next year
no individual illustrated this mix of power more yesterday than <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who chairs the <unk> defense subcommittee
in the final trading the <unk> was insistent on setting aside n million to carry out base closings ordered to begin in fiscal <unk>
but it gave ground to <unk> <unk> on a number of projects ranging from a n million parking garage here to a land transfer in <unk> to a provision to assist the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> state
the tribe is one of the poorest in the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> who chairs the select committee on <unk> <unk> used his power to move n from the <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> affairs to assist in renovating a decommissoned base to accommodate a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center
meanwhile <unk> - <unk> negotiators have tentatively agreed on a n billion anti - drug and anti - crime intitiative cutting other federal spending <unk> to pay for it
a formal <unk> - <unk> conference is expected to ratify the accord later this week
<unk> <unk> is preparing to slash the size of its work force in the <unk> possibly as soon as next month say <unk> individuals familiar with the company strategy
the size of the cuts is n't known but they be centered in the exploration and production division which is responsible for locating oil reserves drilling wells and pumping crude oil and natural gas
employees have n't yet been notified
sources said that meetings to discuss the staff reductions have been scheduled for <unk> at <unk> offices in <unk> <unk> and <unk>
this would be a second round of cuts by <unk> which along with other oil producers and refiners reduced its work force by <unk> to <unk> during the n as part of an industrywide shakeout
<unk> latest move could signal the beginning of further reductions by other oil companies in their domestic oil - producing operations
in yesterday third - quarter earnings report the company alluded to a n million provision for restructuring costs involving <unk> exploration and production operations
the report says that the restructuring will take place over a two - year period and will principally involve the transfer and termination of employees in our <unk> operations
a company spokesman reached at his home last night would only say that there will be a public announcement of the reduction program by the end of the week
most oil companies including <unk> have been reporting lower third - quarter earnings largely as a result of lower earnings from chemicals as well as refining and marketing businesses
individuals familiar with <unk> strategy say that <unk> is reducing its <unk> work force because of declining <unk> output
yesterday <unk> said <unk> domestic exploration and production operations had a n million loss in the third quarter while comparable foreign operations earned n million
industrywide oil production in this country fell by n barrels a day to n million barrels in the first eight months of this year
daily output is expected to decline by at least another <unk> barrels next year
some <unk> executives were dismayed that a reference to the cutbacks was included in the earnings report before workers were notified
one <unk> executive said that the n million charge related to the action indicates n a substantial number of people will be involved
some will likely be offered severance packages while others will be transferred to overseas operations
the <unk> <unk> is in the process of trying to gain control over a law that federal <unk> <unk> <unk> recently called a monster
needless to say he was talking about <unk>
with its recently revised guidelines for <unk> <unk> makes it clear that the law currently holds too many incentives for abuse by prosecutors
the text of the new policy guidelines from the <unk> <unk> are reprinted nearby
they strongly suggest that <unk> prosecutions of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> violated notions of fundamental fairness
<unk> is attempting to avoid a replay of these tactics
this amounts to an extraordinary repudiation of the tenure of <unk> <unk> mayoral candidate and former <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who was more inclined to gathering scalps than understanding markets
the new guidelines limit the pretrial forfeitures of assets of ricoed defendants and their investors clients bankers and others
this follows earlier new guidelines from the <unk> <unk> prohibiting <unk> - like tax cases from masquerading as <unk> cases
the forfeiture memo cited considerable criticism in the press because of a perception that pre - trial freezing of assets is tantamount to a seizure of property without due process
it told prosecutors not to seek forfeitures if there are less intrusive alternatives such as bonds and in any case not to seek forfeitures disproportionate to the defendant crime
these changes come a tad late for <unk> the first ricoed securities firm
it was forced into liquidation before trial when investors yanked their funds after the government demanded a huge pre - trial asset forfeiture
princeton\/newport investors including <unk> <unk> and the <unk> endowment made the rational decision to withdraw their money for the firm the liquidation was sentence first verdict later
prosecutors wanted n million in forfeiture for alleged tax fraud of some n
the experience of <unk> and initiation of other <unk> - forfeiture cases against legitimate businesses taught <unk> that a ricoed investment bank would be an <unk> - investment bank
<unk> therefore agreed instead to an arrangement allowing it to plea to charges which the company is not in a position to dispute because of <unk>
part of <unk> plea was to cut <unk> <unk> loose
so after all the prosecutorial hoopla no one has established what if anything <unk> did wrong
so two cheers for the new rules
<unk> has finally recognized its employees abuses thanks largely to the demands for reform by former <unk> attorney in <unk> <unk> <unk> who wants to salvage <unk> for real criminals
but prosecutorial guidelines are effective only if someone at <unk> is willing and able to supervise hyperactive prosecutors
<unk> <unk> of the appeals court in <unk> made this point at a <unk> <unk> conference last week in a remarkable speech titled <unk> the <unk> that ate jurisprudence
he said <unk> ours is supposed to be a government of laws not of men and yet <unk> defenders tell us that we should rely on prosecutorial discretion to protect against overbreadth of <unk>
no prosecutorial guidelines observed or unobserved limit civil <unk> cases by plaintiffs for damages
what now for <unk> officials <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> should review these cases to see what other prosecutorial abuses may have occurred
we suspect that <unk> will some day agree that only the complete repeal of <unk> can guarantee an end to injustices in its name
the <unk> <unk> <unk> which <unk> <unk> had hoped n would emerge as one of the few bright spots in its otherwise lackluster prime - time schedule is n't turning out to be the hit <unk> the network envisaged
although the half - hour situation comedy seen mondays at <unk> p.m eastern and pacific time is n't a candidate for cancellation it is slated for fine - tuning and by next week the network may announce <unk> <unk> <unk> is moving to n p.m. from its n time slot replacing <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which became the first network show n to be canceled this season
<unk> <unk> which centers on a mailroom clerk - turned agent at a <unk> talent agency was scheduled in the coveted n p.m. slot to follow <unk> <unk> a situation comedy about a television news magazine starring <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> was boosted by favorable reviews and a network - wide promotional tie - in contest with <unk> <unk> <unk>
it was promoted on cable services including <unk> <unk> at <unk> and <unk> and premiered as the no . n show for the week
but five weeks after the premiere the series has floundered
in figures released yesterday by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> produced by the television unit of <unk> pictures <unk> <unk> was in <unk> place
worse every week it suffers audience drop - off from <unk> <unk> and viewership on <unk> picks up again once <unk> <unk> is over and is followed by designing women
there is strong indication that <unk> <unk> is not compatible with the shows n it is surrounding said <unk> <unk> senior vice president at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a unit of <unk> <unk> <unk>
last week <unk> <unk> was viewed by n of the available television households while the number dropped to <unk> for <unk> <unk> and rose to n for designing <unk>
<unk> executives said <unk> the program is also slated to undergo some plot changes
creator <unk> <unk> for example included the lead character greek family in the cast but that is not the right focus anymore said n one <unk> executive
instead <unk> hopes <unk> the show will increasingly highlight the talent agency and the business of being an agent
we making adjustments on the show yes but nothing radical said <unk> <unk> the story consultant on <unk> <unk>
but we hope to keep a balance between the office and the family
the opening credits are being redone <unk> <unk> said <unk> to make <unk> situation clear to viewers who have not been with us since the beginning
those viewers find the show confusing
the stock market woes spooked currency traders but prompted a quiet little party among bond investors
prices of long - term <unk> bonds moved inversely to the stock market as investors sought safety amid growing evidence <unk> the economy is weakening
but the shaky economic outlook and the volatile stock market forced the dollar lower against major currencies
the bond market got an early boost from the opening - hour sell - off in stocks
that rout was triggered by <unk> <unk> announcement late <unk> that the proposed management - labor buy - out had collapsed
the <unk> decline in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> during the morning trading session touched off a flight to safety that saw investors shifting assets from stocks to <unk> bonds
at its strongest the <unk> benchmark <unk> bond rose more than a point or more than <unk> for each <unk> face amount
as the stock market recovered some of its losses later in the day bond prices retreated
but analysts said <unk> the combination of a second consecutive decline in monthly durable - goods orders and lackluster mid - <unk> auto sales helped prop up the <unk> market
a slowing economy and the implication of lower inflation and interest rates tend to bolster bond prices
on the surface the decline in <unk> durable goods only <unk> did n't appear very weak
but orders for non - defense capital goods a precursor of future plant and equipment spending were off <unk> after falling n in <unk>
auto makers reported that mid - <unk> sales were running at an annual rate of about n million units far less than the <unk> million units n analysts had expected
taken together the auto - sales and durable - goods reports confirmed perceptions that the economy is bogging down
although analysts do n't expect the <unk> <unk> to ease credit policy soon reports like those yesterday help build the case for lower rates
now bond investors are looking toward next week report from national purchasing managers and the government <unk> employment report as potentially prompting the <unk> to lower rates
the stock market precipitous drop frightened foreign investors who quickly bid the dollar lower
but as stock prices recovered some of the early losses so did the <unk> currency
although dealers said n investors are becoming more bearish toward the dollar in the wake of the stock market recent troubles and as the <unk> economy weakens the dollar ended down only modestly
in major market activity <unk> prices rose
the <unk> benchmark <unk> bond gained nearly half a point or about n for each <unk> face amount
the yield on the issue slipped to <unk>
the dollar retreated
in late <unk> <unk> trading the currency was quoted at n marks and n yen compared with n marks and n yen <unk>
lifestyles of the <unk> and <unk> may be visiting some new venues in the near future
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> sentenced <unk> <unk> to n years in the big house yesterday while a <unk> <unk> judge tucked away <unk> <unk> <unk> for three days plus n hours of work with homeless women
<unk> <unk> recanted her earlier - expressed fear of jailhouse lesbians
<unk> <unk> said <unk> he was guilty of sin but not fraud
we can only wonder who will be the next lost soul chosen to be <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ordered a dozen n jetliners valued at a total of about n million
the <unk> and <unk> series aircraft will be powered by engines jointly produced by <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
currently <unk> has a backlog of about n billion but production has been slowed by a strike of <unk> machinists which entered its <unk> day today
last week a mediator failed to rekindle talks between the company and the strikers who have rejected a pay raise offer of <unk> over three years
when the good fairy assigned to <unk> hovered over the cradle of <unk> <unk> many years ago in <unk> she sprinkled her with high e flats sparkling <unk> clean trills and coloratura ornaments silvery as magic dust
maybe she could drop by at the <unk> <unk> and bring along what she forgot a little charm a few smidgins of thespian skills and a nice wig
<unk> as <unk> <unk> in a new production of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> last week did many things nicely and others not so well
it is n't every day that we hear a <unk> who can sing the first act high - flying music with all the little notes perfectly pitched and neatly stitched together
never once did she gasp for air or mop her brow
she was as cool as a cucumber
but as you may know things are not going well for <unk>
there are times when she must show a little emotion
she has <unk> after all and a weak - kneed lover and though a successful courtesan she is just about overdrawn at the bank
worse her walls move all the time at least in this production
just when <unk> <unk> sat down away from her guests to cough in private her salon began sliding around the stage her country hideaway also has a very active set of drapes
hold on to those funny braids you wanted to caution her as the sets started to roll around once more
this is the most moving <unk> <unk> i ever seen
normally <unk> can go about her business without wondering whether she is moving as gracefully as the scenery
but this is a production designed and directed by <unk> <unk> and paid for by <unk> <unk> who has no need to count her pennies unlike <unk> down to <unk> louis at the opera end
seeing all those millions in action i was just so relieved that <unk> <unk> gawky thing that she is did n't accidentally smother herself in a drape
large and lavish <unk> is another addition to the <unk> growing stock of cast - proof productions mostly by <unk> <unk>
they have a life of their own and can be counted on to look good and perform whenever a cast is n't up to either
if a strike ever hits the <unk> the company can still sell tickets to his <unk> and <unk> and boom out recordings of another era
last week discerning audience gave a bigger hand to a greenhouse than to the tenor <unk> <unk> who sang an aria inside it
inexplicably costumed as a rabbinical student tottering around on lifts <unk> <unk> hardly seemed the fellow n to catch a fancy cocotte eye
i wish <unk> he could wear lifts in his voice
not nearly in his best form the tenor made dullish sounds along with his usual clumsy hand gestures
maybe <unk> <unk> was too busy taming his set n to work with his naturally ungainly <unk>
or is it that <unk> <unk> is getting a little tired of <unk>
this is the same production already seen in <unk> and <unk> and its scenic ideas echo the movie n he made with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
decades earlier <unk> <unk> sang the <unk> staging that introduced the flashback idea
in an invention that drives <unk> purists bananas <unk> lies dying in bed during the prelude rising deliriously when then she remembers the great parties <unk> she used to throw
the entire opera is her dream
given the prelude thematic connections with the music preceding the last act the idea is more worn than bad though as luck would have it for a change there actually was a conductor in the pit whom we wanted to hear <unk> <unk> trying to make memorable music while we all waited for the bed lump to stir into song
once she did so the big - souled german maestro with the shaky nerves who so often cancels offered a limpid flowing performance that in its unswagged and unswaggering approach was totally at odds with the staging
of heart - pounding moments there were nearly none and whether this has to do with <unk> <unk> or the wooden cast is hard n to say
in any event <unk> <unk> barely ventilated <unk> anguish in her long meeting with <unk> <unk> who as <unk> seemed fairly desperate trying to inject an <unk> lilt into his heavy teutonic baritone
<unk> <unk> was n't much of an advertisement for sunny southern <unk>
perhaps <unk> <unk> could let him substitute one of the songs about dead children and dark nights from <unk> <unk>
speaking of dark nights the <unk> next - door neighbor the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has canceled its season after failing to reach a settlement with its musicians who wanted pay parity with the the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> orchestras
well they can now go and audition there
good luck
common sense suggests that people who play for a company that charges about half what those houses do for a ticket are not in the same market
the cancellation bodes poorly for a company already beset with an identity crisis exacerbated by the retirement of general director <unk> <unk> and the amazing appointment of <unk> <unk> as her successor after his years of feckless toiling in the pit
as the <unk> discovered years ago following a belated <unk> opening it is nearly impossible to recapture subscribers once they have had time n to ponder their entertainment choices
i for instance was perfectly happy at <unk> <unk> <unk> the other day listening to <unk> <unk> conduct the <unk> per <unk> a strange piece written by n different italian composers to honor <unk> after his death in <unk>
each of them contributed a section at the behest of <unk> who was nearly driven to his own early grave by the troublesome arrangements
for all that the piece landed unperformed in a dusty archive after <unk> refused to supply a chorus and orchestra
we know <unk> <unk> own contribution was mighty impressive since the operatic <unk> me was reworked for the <unk> <unk> of which he wrote every note himself having learned his lesson
the surprising discovery of the evening at <unk> was the high standard achieved by some of his now - obscure colleagues notably <unk> <unk>
his melodious <unk> was smoothly sung by bass <unk> <unk>
also <unk> <unk> <unk> aeterna was intriguingly scored and splendidly put across by <unk> <unk>
he brought along his <unk> - based <unk> <unk> chorus and even better the czech soprano <unk> <unk>
she was in her most radiant expressive voice
maybe she could step across the plaza to the <unk> where she has still to make her debut and help out her czech compatriot by singing the slow parts of <unk>
the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was no match for the <unk> <unk> <unk> in terms of prestige but it made its mark it awarded the largest cash prize of any film festival to young and first - time film makers
at this year event the third since the festival got under way in <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> won the <unk> <unk> prize of n for <unk> <unk> <unk>
by comparison <unk> now gives n to the winner of its young director award
says director <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> i think n the <unk> festival may become known as a major attraction for young directors because of the money as well as the recognition
there are drawbacks
<unk> <unk> a correspondent for the french magazine <unk> says of the recently ended <unk> festival no one makes deals and most of the films have been seen before at other festivals
belgium decided that investors who demand the delivery of their securities when they buy shares or domestic bonds will have to pay an additional <unk> belgian francs about n for each transaction bringing the total fee to <unk> francs
while no figures exist it is thought that many small investors in <unk> store securities privately in some cases to avoid paying high inheritance taxes
the law could redound to the advantage of brokers and banks who incur high administrative costs to deliver securities to investors
<unk> is considering giving aid to <unk> and <unk> to support their recent political reforms a spokesman for the <unk> <unk> said <unk>

those employees are suspected of illegally gaining an estimated n million the prosecutor was quoted as saying <unk> by the <unk> news service
he added that federal agents hope to recover at least half that amount
the rest will probably not be recoverable either because the statute of limitations expired or because many prefer to spend additional time in jail rather than return the money the prosecutor said

medieval philosophers used to hold the sensible belief that it was more perfect to exist than not to exist and that to exist as a matter of necessity was most perfect of all
now only <unk> exists as a matter of absolute necessity it is built into his nature
but since the time of <unk> we humans could at least claim a sort of natural necessity for the existence of our species
are n't we after all the inevitable culmination of that stately pageant called evolution
if mutation and natural selection slowly but surely give rise to more and more advanced forms of life then it was only a matter of eons before splendid beings endowed with reason self - awareness and taste shimmered onto the scene
now along comes <unk> <unk> <unk> to dash this flattering illusion
his credentials are excellent for the task
star lecturer at <unk> author of numerous popular books on science and scourge of the creationist lobby <unk> <unk> is perhaps the world most eminent evolutionary theorist
yet he puts quite a twist on the old story handed down from <unk>
for him natural history is anything but a gradual predictable march from primordial slime to human consciousness it is a careening chaotic affair in which the emergence of a featherless biped was a one - in-a-million shot
in <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> and the nature of <unk> <unk> <unk> pages <unk> <unk> <unk> makes his case for the awesome improbability of human evolution
the argument turns on the discovery in <unk> of an amazing fossil quarry high in the canadian rockies called the <unk> <unk>
here in an area smaller than a city block lay buried traces of countless weird creatures that had frolicked more than n million years ago creatures whose anatomical variety far exceeded what can be found in all the world oceans today
such an embarrassment of riches was inconceivable to the man who discovered the <unk> <unk> one <unk> <unk> <unk>
the received darwinian wisdom of the day said that animals living so long ago must be simple in design limited in scope and ancestral to contemporary species
accordingly the hidebound traditionalist reconstructed hypothetical organisms from the <unk> fossils in such a way that they could be shoehorned into familiar categories
it was not until the early n that <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> and two sharp graduate students began to publish a reinterpretation of the <unk> <unk>
by making clever inferences about how the squashed and distorted fossil remains corresponded to three - dimensional structures this trio was able to piece together a series of wondrous beasties quite unlike anything currently on the planet
one was so fantastic in appearance n it was dubbed <unk>
would that <unk> <unk> minute descriptions of these creatures was always so colorful
a good deal of the book is boring particularly the endless allusions to high and pop culture and the frequent jokes festooning the text
these turns do not provide sufficient relief from sentences like most modern chelicerates have six uniramous appendages on the prosoma
interest picks up though when <unk> <unk> gets around to discussing the meaning of the <unk> oddities for the theory of evolution
not long after the appearance of life evidently there was an explosive proliferation in the number of animal designs seen on the earth
the vast majority of them however were wiped out by a succession of environmental upheavals that were too sudden and catastrophic for the normal rules of natural selection to operate
consequently the winnowing process was like a lottery in which each group held a ticket unrelated to its anatomical virtues
so much for survival of the fittest
so much too for the notion that we humans triumphed in the darwinian struggle by evolving big brains
our mammalian forerunners lucked out through the extraterrestrial impact that did in the dinosaurs because they were small not smart
if anyone has difficulty imagining a world in which history went merrily on without us <unk> <unk> sketches several
in one birds are the dominant carnivores in another the seas abound with little penises
back when the <unk> fauna were flourishing it seems n human evolutionary hopes hung on the survival of a little worm with a backbone called <unk>
<unk> <unk> finds this oddly exhilarating like an existentialist of old he views our contingency as a source of both freedom and consequent moral responsibility
i by contrast can not help feeling that if some other curiosity from the <unk> <unk> had survived instead beings at once wiser and less boorish than homo sapiens might have eventually gained earthly dominion
but even if no conscious life had evolved here at all the universe is a big place and given the right conditions sympathetic to creating some form of life
surely at some other cosmic address a gouldoid creature would have risen out of the ooze to explain why paleontologically speaking it is indeed a wonderful life
<unk> <unk> is a columnist for the <unk> <unk> in <unk>
the <unk> <unk> scrambled to play down the significance of its new guidelines concerning prosecutions under the federal racketeering law
the guidelines were distributed to <unk> attorneys last summer but were disclosed for the first time by press reports this week
they discourage prosecutors under certain circumstances from seeking court orders seizing the assets of racketeering defendants prior to trial
but <unk> <unk> chief <unk> <unk> spokesman said n the guidelines are a codification and a clarification far more than a new direction
<unk> of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> organizations law against white - collar defendants as opposed to alleged organized - crime figures has come under attack from some defense lawyers and legal scholars
critics have complained that the law unfairly strips defendants of assets before a jury determines n they have committed a crime and that aggressive use of the forfeiture provisions can ruin corporate defendants or force them into unfavorable plea bargains
in the new guidelines the <unk> <unk> says that in attempting to freeze disputed assets before trial the government will not seek to disrupt the normal legitimate business activities of the defendant and will not seek to take from third parties assets legitimately transferred to them
the guidelines also state n the government policy is not to seek the fullest forfeiture permissible under the law where that forfeiture would be disproportionate to the defendant crime
another provision clarifies certain limits on when prosecutors may use tax - fraud charges as a basis for bringing a racketeering case
<unk> <unk> declined to speculate on whether the guidelines would curb racketeering prosecutions against corporate defendants
the impact if there is any will be impossible n to judge ahead of time because the decision whether to use racketeering charges is made in individual cases by <unk> <unk> officials in <unk> he said
in a memorandum describing the guidelines <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said that government efforts to freeze defendants assets pending racketeering prosecutions have been the subject of considerable criticism in the press
but <unk> <unk> said <unk> the government is n't backing off on these kinds of matters at all
<unk> legislators searching for ways <unk> to pay for the <unk> billion to n billion in damages from last week earthquake are laying the groundwork for a temporary increase in the state sales tax
the talk of a sales tax rise follows a rebuff from <unk> on the question of how much the federal government is willing to spend to aid in <unk> earthquake relief efforts
the state had sought as much as n billion in relief but yesterday the <unk> approved a more general scaled - back measure calling for <unk> billion in aid the bulk of which would go to <unk> with an unspecified amount going to regions affected by <unk> <unk>
that leaves the state roughly n billion to <unk> billion short
a sales tax increase appears to be the fastest and easiest n to raise funds in a hurry
according to the state department of finance a one - penny increase in the state six - cent per dollar sales tax could raise <unk> billion
<unk> <unk> speaker of <unk> <unk> said that <unk> <unk> <unk> has agreed to schedule a special session of the legislature within two weeks
<unk> so - called <unk> limit effectively prevents the state from spending new tax money and so drastically limits its options in an emergency
both <unk> <unk> the state most influential legislator and <unk> <unk> favor a temporary sales tax increase should more money be needed than the state can raise from existing sources and the federal government
according to a spokesman the governor is also studying the possibility of raising state gasoline taxes
<unk> <unk> meanwhile believes <unk> only one tax will be feasible and it will be a one - penny sales tax increase said <unk> <unk> an aide
one immediate source of money is an emergency fund set up by <unk> <unk>
the fund has about <unk> billion and is set up to handle precisely the kind of emergency n the state faces said <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> deputy press secretary
but the fund size is disputed by <unk> <unk> office which estimates n the fund holds from n million to n million
moreover an aide to <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> has expressed a desire not to spend all the reserve on this
to push through a sales tax increase however the state will have to suspend the <unk> limit citing an emergency
and then it will be required to lower taxes by a corresponding amount during a three - year period after the temporary tax increase ends said <unk> <unk> <unk> assistant director of the state department of finance
a sales tax increase would require two - thirds approval in both houses of the state legislature
but observers expect broad support
if there an emergency and there are n't sufficient funds from elsewhere i think n the attitude will be supportive said <unk> <unk> president of the <unk> <unk> of <unk>
but others think n property owners ought to pay a higher portion of the state earthquake relief tab
since the late <unk> <unk> property owners have benefited from a tax rollback as a result of a state ballot initiative known as <unk> <unk>
the state could also increase gasoline taxes every one penny increase in the tax would yield n million a month
but <unk> <unk> and others are reluctant to do anything n to harm the state chances of sharply raising gasoline taxes on a permanent basis
to raise more highway funds a measure n to double the state nine - cent a gallon tax over five years is set to appear on the state <unk> election ballot
but some fear n imposing a temporary gasoline tax increase in the meantime could undercut support among voters for the measure
not everyone is convinced <unk> the state must raise new revenue to meet its earthquake needs
it possible though not probable that the state could get by with its existing resources and federal help said <unk> <unk> chairman of the state senate transportation committee
separately two men injured in last week earthquake - triggered freeway collapse in <unk> began a legal battle against the state over whether officials adequately heeded warnings about the structure safety
the claims which were filed with the <unk> <unk> of <unk> but will probably end up in court are the first arising out of the collapse of the so - called <unk> structure viaduct
the men can defeat immunities that states often assert in court by showing that officials knew or should have known that design of the structure was defective and that they failed to make reasonable changes
a <unk> of <unk> spokesman said <unk> the board had not seen the claim and declined to comment

people start their own businesses for many reasons
but a chance to fill out sales - tax records is rarely one of them
red tape is the bugaboo of small business
ironically the person who wants to run his or her own business is probably the active results - oriented sort most likely to hate meeting the rules and record - keeping demands of federal state and local regulators
yet every business owner has to face the mound of forms and regulations and often is the only one available to tackle it
there is hope of change
last week <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> held hearings on a bill n to strengthen an existing law designed to reduce regulatory hassles for small businesses
a great many federal regulations are meant for larger entities and do n't really apply to small businesses says <unk> <unk> a legislative aide to <unk> <unk>
other lawmakers are busy trying to revive the recently lapsed <unk> <unk> <unk> which many feel n benefited small enterprises
thus optimistic entrepreneurs await a promised land of less red tape just as soon as <unk> <unk> gets around to arranging it
meanwhile they tackle the mounds of paper and fantasize about a dream world where bulk - mail postal regulations and government inspectors are banished
to find out what red tape riles entrepreneurs most the <unk> asked a completely unscientific random sample of business owners to fantasize about the forms and regulations n they would most like to get lost in the mail
some entrepreneurs say n the red tape n they most love to hate is red tape n they would also hate to lose
they concede that much of the government meddling that torments them is essential to the public good and even to their own businesses
rules that set standards for products or govern business behavior generally the best regarded form of red tape create a level playing field and keep unscrupulous competitors away says <unk> <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> business that designs telecommunication and other products
<unk> <unk> cites the <unk> communications <unk> and its standards for telecommunications equipment they monitor product quality and prevent junk from flooding the market
some gripes about red tape are predictable architects complain about a host of building regulations auto leasing companies about car insurance rules
determining when handicapped access is required can be a nightmare for architects says <unk> <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> architectural firm
there is such a maze of federal state and local codes that building inspectors are backing away from interpreting them <unk> <unk> says <unk>
taxi leasing and other companies that maintain fleets of vehicles devote substantial resources to complying with state insurance laws and a host of agencies
it very costly and time - consuming says <unk> <unk> a partner in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> car - leasing company
one senior executive at his firm spends nearly n of his time on insurance he says n
other forms of red tape are more pervasive
the most onerous many entrepreneurs say <unk> is the record - keeping and filing required by tax authorities
complying with environmental and workplace regulations runs a close second
but gripes run the gamut
here is the red tape that irks surveyed business owners the most
environmental regulations
next to medical insurance costs of compliance are the fastest - growing expense at <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> chemical company
<unk> <unk> the company owner says n spending on regulatory paper work and the people n to do it mostly n to comply with federal state and local environmental laws will rise almost n this year to <unk>
<unk> <unk> adds that spending on environmental red tape amounts to between <unk> and <unk> of <unk> total operating expenses
<unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> maker of thin metal precision parts must report to five federal and state agencies as well as to local fire police hospital and plumbing authorities says <unk> <unk> <unk> president
one state environmental regulator returned a report because it was n't heavy enough it could n't have been correct <unk> <unk> says <unk>
withholding rules
employers must deposit withholding taxes exceeding n within three days after payroll or pay stiff penalties and that a big problem for small businesses
it especially nettlesome if you on the road and you the one responsible says <unk> <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> money - management firm
employee manuals
revising employee manuals on pensions health care and other subjects costs over <unk> a year for <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> provider of business services to farmers
an employer leaves itself open to a great deal of liability if its employee manuals do n't reflect the most recent laws he says n
but the ever - changing laws are usually so complicated and confusing that you need professionals to help you you ca n't do it yourself he adds n
pension and profit - sharing rules
complying with these is enough to make business owners look forward to their own pension days
yearly changes in federal benefit laws force small businesses to repeatedly re - evaluate and redesign existing plans
<unk> <unk> who runs her own public - relations concern in <unk> <unk> says n she has had to overhaul her pension and profit - sharing plans three times in the past three years
it does n't increase benefits but it costly and time - consuming <unk> <unk> says
compliance added n to n to her accounting bill last year she says n
sales tax records
advertising agencies and other service companies are exempt from city and state sales tax in most locales but the exemption comes at a price of exhaustive records and rigorous reviews
to justify their exempt status and avoid penalties these businesses must show once a year that each and every transaction on which they did n't pay sales tax was a legitimate business expense
you need one person <unk> to just take care of sales tax says <unk> <unk> executive vice president of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
when the <unk> <unk> <unk> named <unk> <unk> its artistic director last spring the nation theatrical cognoscenti arched a collective eyebrow
<unk> <unk> an acclaimed creator of deconstructed dramatic collages that tear into such sacred texts as <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> is decidedly downtown
<unk> <unk> meanwhile is one of the nation oldest and most respected regional theaters still hosting an annual a <unk> <unk>
how would this bastion of traditional values fare in <unk> <unk> iconoclastic hands
she held her fire with her first production at the trinity earlier this season
it was a predictable revival of her prize - winning off - <unk> anthology of <unk> <unk> theoretical writings called no plays no <unk>
now with the opening of <unk> <unk> bourgeois - bashing <unk> <unk> <unk> has laid her cards on the table
hers is a hand that will test the mettle of her audiences
for <unk> <unk> who initially studied and directed in <unk> and cites such european directors as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> as influences tends to stage her productions with a brechtian rigor whether the text demands it or not
and <unk> considered the father of soviet socialist realism did not write plays that easily lend themselves to deliberately antirealistic distancing techniques
<unk> was a loyal if occasionally ambivalent proletarian writer committed to enlightening the masses with plain speaking rooted in a slightly sour version of chekhovian humanism
and <unk> penned in <unk> as a kind of sequel to <unk> <unk> <unk> is a lawn party of russian yuppies engaged in an exhausting ideological fight to the finish between the allrightniks and the reformers
along the way there also are lots of romantic dalliances
wisely <unk> <unk> has kept <unk> time and place intact
despite the absence of samovars and a tendency to turn the furniture upside down the production is rich in russian ennui voiced by languorous folk sporting beige linen and rumpled cotton with boaters and fishing poles aplenty
but beyond this decorative nod to tradition <unk> <unk> and company head off in a stylistic direction that all but transforms <unk> naturalistic drama into something akin to well farce
the director attempt to force some brechtian distance between her actors and their characters frequently backfires with performances that are unduly mannered
not only do the actors stand outside their characters and make it clear n they are at odds with them but they often literally stand on their heads
like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> manipulates her actors as if they were rag dolls sprawling them on staircases dangling them off tables even hanging them from precipices while having them perform some gymnastic feats of derring - do
there are moments in this <unk> when the characters populating the vast multilevel country house which looks like a parody of <unk> <unk> <unk> and is designed by <unk> <unk> spout philosophic bon mots with the self - conscious rat - a-tat-tat pacing of <unk> in
talk hurts from where it spurts one of them says
the clash of ideologies survives this treatment but the nuance and richness of <unk> individual characters have vanished in the scuffle
as for the humor that <unk> text provides when repainted in such broad strokes particularly by the lesser members of the ensemble it looks and sounds forced
<unk> <unk> does better with music than with words when she wants as she so often does want to express herself through <unk> helpless play
here she has the aid of her longtime associate <unk> <unk> whom she appointed <unk> first - ever musical director and whom she equipped with a spanking new n sound system and recording studio
for <unk> <unk> <unk> provided an aural collage of <unk> and <unk> which is less a score than a separate character with a distinct point of view
like <unk> and indeed <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has said that her intent in such manipulative staging of the classics is simply an attempt to make it new
indeed during a recent post - production audience discussion the director explained that her fondest artistic wish was to find a way n to play somewhere over the <unk> so that the song original beauty comes through surmounting the cliche
the danger that <unk> <unk> seems to be courting here is one of obfuscation rather than rejuvenation a vision so at odds with the playwright that the two points of view nullify rather than illuminate each other
<unk> <unk> cast is part and parcel of the problem
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> never find a real reason for their love affair as the foolish idealistic young <unk> and the tirelessly humanitarian doctor <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> as the long - suffering <unk> is a tiresome whiner not the inspirational counterrevolutionary n <unk> intended
better to look in the corners for performances that inspire or amuse
<unk> <unk> in addition to possessing one of the evening more impressive vocal instruments brings an unsuspected comedic touch to her role of <unk> everybody favorite mom
<unk> <unk> plays the maid with so much edge as to steal her two scenes
but it is the <unk> <unk> newcomer <unk> <unk> <unk> the paralegal who is the actor n to watch whether he is hamming it up while conducting the chamber musicians or seducing his neighbor wife <unk> <unk> by licking her bosom
<unk> <unk> <unk> writes frequently about theater
during its centennial year the <unk> <unk> <unk> will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of american business history
<unk> <unk> the once stodgy investment house in <unk> helped a corporate client complete a hostile takeover
it was the start of a boom in unfriendly even ungentlemanly mergers
on <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> advised by <unk> offered n a share equal to n million for <unk> a <unk> battery maker
<unk> said <unk> it was given only a three - hour advance warning on a take it or leave it basis from <unk> as the <unk> company is called
<unk> is aware that a hostile tender offer is being made by a foreign company for all of <unk> shares said <unk> <unk> <unk> president
hostile thus entered the merger - acquisition lexicon
<unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which became a leading legal firm in merger cases said <unk> the case made takeovers respectable
<unk> spurned <unk> and within five days <unk> had a white knight as <unk> <unk> headed by <unk> <unk> a shrewdly friendly acquirer of companies offered n a share
<unk> was advised by <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
esb directors warmly accepted but a whirlwind bidding match ensued
within a few days in <unk> <unk> raised its bid to <unk> and <unk> matched it
on a single day <unk> lifted its offer to <unk> and then to n equal to n million
<unk> met the <unk> but then withdrew
esb on <unk> <unk> accepted the <unk> offer and the brief battle unlike the intricate and lengthy big takeovers of <unk> was over
the new gritty game became a money maker for <unk> <unk> once austere old - name houses
<unk> paid <unk> an advisory fee of about <unk> a paltry figure by today measures
early this year <unk> and three other investment houses each received n million in advisory fees from <unk> <unk> <unk> in its n billion friendly buy - out of <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> said <unk> third - quarter net income slid <unk> to n million or n per fully diluted share from n million or <unk> a fully diluted share because of increased bad assets and unexpected trouble in unloading foreclosed property
the decline surprised analysts and jolted <unk> stock which lost n of its value closing at <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> down <unk>
<unk> had been one of the handful of large <unk> <unk> thrifts that in recent quarters had counteracted interest - rate problems dogging the industry by keeping a lid on problem assets and lending heavily into the furious <unk> housing market
analysts had been projecting fully diluted earnings in the third quarter in the range of about <unk> a share
however <unk> loan originations and purchases plunged n in the quarter to n billion from n billion a year earlier
meanwhile non - performing assets rose to n million from n million
some n million of the troubled assets is repossessed real estate a <unk> surge from the n million of repossesed property <unk> <unk> held a year ago
<unk> has <unk> billion of assets
<unk> said n most of the troubled assets are apartment complexes shopping malls and other commercial real estate
it said <unk> about half are in <unk> with the rest scattered across the country
it said n sales of such properties were slower than anticipated in the third quarter but it expects sales to pick up in the rest of the year
<unk> said n the slide in loan originations was more a matter of design than a sign of cooling in the <unk> market
any such downturn in <unk> would be grim news for <unk> <unk> thrifts particularly the less healthy ones which have performed poorly even with a torrid market
but <unk> said n it purposely curbed loan originations in the quarter because of uncertainty over the new capital requirements and regulations that will emerge from negotiations over implementing the government massive thrift bailout bill
it said <unk> its real - estate operations earned a record n million more than double year - earlier real estate profit of n million
and analysts said n they see no signs of an imminent swoon in <unk> real estate even with last week earthquake
the thrift said <unk> earnings also were nicked in the quarter by a n million provision for losses associated with its previously reported plan to liquidate a real - estate franchise network
for the nine months <unk> earned n million or <unk> a fully diluted share a n increase from year - earlier net income of n million or <unk> a fully diluted share
yields on certificates of deposit at major banks were little changed in the latest week
the average yield on six - month cds of <unk> and less slipped to <unk> from <unk> according to <unk> <unk> markets an information service based here
on one - year cds of <unk> and less the average slid to <unk> from <unk>
both issues are among the most popular with individual investors
because of shrinkage in the economy rates can be expected to decline over a one - year horizon said <unk> <unk> chairman of <unk>
it unclear how much rates can fall and how soon
changes in cd yields in the week ended <unk> were in line with blips up and down within a fairly narrow range for the last two months
interest rates generally began declining last spring after moving steadily upward for more than a year
the average yield on small - denomination three - month cds moved up two - hundredths of a percentage point in the latest week to n
long - term cds declined just a fraction
the average yield on both two - year cds and five - year cds was <unk>
only cds sold by major brokerage firms posted significant increases in average yields in the latest week reflecting increased yields on <unk> bills sold at <unk> auction
the average yield on six - month broker - sold cds rose to <unk> from <unk> and on one - year cds the average yield rose to <unk> from <unk>

<unk> <unk> <unk> has been the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> specialist firm in charge of trading stock in <unk> <unk> and its predecessors since the early n
but the firm has never had a day like yesterday
at first <unk> did n't open because of an order imbalance
when it did a half - hour into the session it was priced at <unk> a share down more than <unk> from <unk> close
it sank further to as low as <unk> but a big rally developed in the last half hour pushing the stock back up to close at <unk> down just n from <unk>
in the process n million shares traded making <unk> the second most active issue on the <unk> <unk>

added <unk> <unk> there were some pretty bad losses in the stock
<unk> <unk> traders said <unk> a <unk> buy order at <unk> a share entered by <unk> <unk> <unk> which was active in <unk> stock all day is what set off the <unk> crowd in the late afternoon
a subsequent rally in <unk> helped the staggering stock market stage an astonishing recovery from an n deficit to finish only slightly below <unk> close
both <unk> traders who had been hoping <unk> <unk> trading would get back to normal read the news about the unraveling of <unk> takeover plans on the train into work yesterday morning
the news told them n it would be a while longer before <unk> resumed trading like a regular airline stock after months of gyrations
when <unk> <unk> walked into the office at n a.m. <unk> he announced ok buckle up
<unk> <unk> and <unk> walked on the <unk> <unk> floor at about n a.m. yesterday and immediately spotted trouble

the <unk> news had already caused a selling furor in the so - called third market in which firms buy and sell stock away from the exchange floor
<unk> which closed on the <unk> <unk> <unk> at <unk> a share traded in the third market afterward as low as <unk> a share
there were rumors of n trades
in the <unk> minutes before the <unk> opening bell the <unk> specialists kept getting sell orders heavier than they imagined <unk>
and at <unk> they posted a n to n first indication or the price range in which the stock would probably open
that range was quickly narrowed to <unk> to n although traders surrounding the post were told that <unk> to <unk> would be the likely target
when <unk> finally opened a half hour late some n shares traded at <unk>
there was selling pressure from everyone said n one trader
this month <unk> market plunge spurred by <unk> news was n't as bad for the <unk> specialists as yesterday action
on that earlier day the stock trading was halted at a critical time so the specialists could catch their breath
not yesterday
<unk> <unk> his gray hair flying did n't wear out his red - white-and-blue sneakers but he sweat so much n he considered sending out for a new shirt
<unk> <unk> usually handles day - to-day <unk> trading on his own
but yesterday the heavy trading action eventually consumed not only <unk> <unk> and <unk> but four other <unk> partners all doing their specialist - firm job of tugging buyers and sellers together and adjusting prices to accommodate the market
about <unk> floor traders crammed near the <unk> post most of the day and probably hundreds more came and went a seething mass as one trader described it
the n million - share volume flowing through the <unk> specialist operation was about five times normal for the stock
the heavy buying in the last half hour led the specialists to take special steps
the <unk> <unk> order that marked the late - day turnaround caused a massive buying effort as <unk> jumped n a share to n in the last half hour said <unk> <unk> <unk>
with <unk> seconds of trading n to go <unk> <unk> with what voice he had left announced to the trading mob we going to trade one price on the bell
that meant <unk> no trading would occur in the final seconds as a way of making sure that last - second orders are n't subjected to a sudden price swing that would upset customers

<unk> current account deficit dropped to <unk> billion n billion in <unk> from an adjusted n billion n billion the previous month but the improvement comes amid increasing concern that a recession could strike the <unk> economy next year
the <unk> of <unk> <unk> latest survey shows that business executives expect a pronounced slowdown largely because of a <unk> series of interest - rate increases that has raised banks base lending rates to n
the outlook has deteriorated since the summer with orders and employment falling and output at a standstill said <unk> <unk> chairman of the industry group economic committee
he also said n investment by businesses is falling off
of <unk> companies surveyed n expect to cut spending on plant equipment and machinery while only n plan to spend more
but despite mounting recession fears government data do n't yet show the economy grinding to a halt

but he said n the downturn probably wo n't become a major contraction similar to those of <unk> and <unk>
still <unk> current slump is a cause for concern here as the nation joins in the <unk> <unk> plan to create a unified market by <unk>
compared with the major economies on the continent the <unk> faces both higher inflation and lower growth in the next several months
as a result <unk> <unk> warned <unk> investment will be more likely to flow toward the other european economies and the <unk> will be less prepared for the single market
<unk> latest trade figures contained some positive news for the economy such as a surge in the volume of exports which were n higher than a year earlier
but while <unk> exports rose to n billion imports shot up to <unk> billion
the resulting n billion merchandise trade deficit was partly offset by an assumed surplus of n million in so - called invisible items which include income from investments services and official transfers
despite the narrowing of the monthly trade gap economists expect the current account deficit for all of n to swell to about n billion from n billion in <unk>
increasingly economists say n the big deficit reflects the slipping competitive position of british industry
when the country gets wealthier we tend to buy high - quality imports <unk> <unk> said

it a big - risk business warns <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> attorney and former <unk> state securities commissioner
you have to go into it firmly believing that it the kind of investment where you can lose everything
and many have done just that
consider <unk> <unk> a prominent <unk> horse farm that went public in <unk> but hit hard times and filed for bankruptcy - court protection last year
a group of investors recently bought the remaining assets of <unk> hoping to rebuild it
other investors have lost millions in partnerships that bought thoroughbred racehorses or stallion breeding rights
one big problem has been the thoroughbred racehorse market
from <unk> to <unk> prices for the best yearlings at the summer sales rose n to an average of <unk>
since then prices have slumped to an average of <unk> this summer
but that for the best horses with most selling for much less as little as n for some pedestrian thoroughbreds

it just a matter of marketing and promoting ourselves says <unk> <unk> a fifth - generation horse breeder from <unk>
maybe it not that simple

and for every champion there are plenty of nags
<unk> <unk> a veteran trainer at the <unk> <unk> track offers neophytes a sobering tour of a horse barn noting that only three of about a dozen horses have won sizable purses

you can see the highs and lows of the business all under one roof she tells the group
there are n't too many winners
perhaps the biggest hurdle n owners face is convincing newcomers that this is a reputable business
some badly managed partnerships have burned investors sometimes after they received advice from industry consultants
so owners have developed a code of ethics outlining rules for consultants and agents and disclosure of fees and any conflicts of interest
but some are skeptical of the code effectiveness
the industry is based on individual honesty says <unk> <unk> a <unk> horse farmer and one of the investors who bought <unk>
despite the drop in prices for thoroughbreds owning one still is n't cheap
at the low end investors can spend n or more to own a racehorse in partnership with others
at a yearling sale a buyer can go solo and get a horse for a few thousand dollars
but that means paying the horse maintenance on average it costs <unk> a year to raise a horse

<unk> <unk> <unk> executives and lawyers provided misleading and false information to the <unk> in <unk> in an effort to cover up longstanding fraudulent billing practices federal prosecutors alleged n in legal briefs
the government startling allegations filed only days before the scheduled start of a criminal overcharge trial against <unk> in <unk> federal district court challenge the motives and veracity of the nation third - largest defense contractor
in a strongly worded response summarizing a filing made in the same court yesterday <unk> asserted that prosecutors have misstated the testimony of witnesses distorted documents and ignored important facts
the company attacked the government allegations as reckless and baseless mudslinging and said <unk> its management promptly and accurately reported to the <unk> all relevant information about billing practices
the case strikes at the corporate image of <unk> which provides the military with everything from jet engines and electronic warfare equipment to highly classified design work on the <unk> <unk> <unk> and could cause a loss of future defense contracts if <unk> and <unk> <unk> officials take a tough stance
the company has been considered an industry leader in advocating cooperation and voluntary disclosures of improper or inflated billing practices
but the government now claims that a group of company managers and lawyers engaged in an elaborate strategy over five years to obscure from federal authorities the extent and details of widespread fraudulent billing practices
the problems were uncovered during a series of internal investigations of the company <unk> <unk> division which has been the focus of two separate overcharge prosecutions by the government since <unk>
the dispute stems from pretrial maneuvering in the pending court case in which prosecutors have been demanding access to a host of internal company memos reports and documents
last <unk> a federal grand jury indicted <unk> on charges of fraud and false claims in connection with an alleged scheme to defraud the <unk> of n million on a logistics computer contract
the company for its part maintains that many of the disputed documents are privileged attorney - client communications that should n't be turned over to prosecutors
a hearing is scheduled on the issue today
the government n filing covers events leading up to the current case and an earlier indictment in <unk> <unk> when <unk> was accused of defrauding the <unk> by illegally claiming cost overruns on <unk> missile contracts
<unk> pleaded guilty and paid a fine of more than n million in the <unk> case which involved some of the same individuals and operations that are at the center of the dispute in the <unk> court
in order to show that all of its units had corrected billing problems and therefore should become eligible again for new contracts prosecutors contend that high - level <unk> executives and company lawyers provided misleading statements to then - <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other <unk> officials during a series of meetings in <unk>
overall the government contends that <unk> disclosure efforts largely were intended to curry favor with <unk> officials without detailing the extent of the management lapses and allegedly pervasive billing irregularities uncovered by company investigations
prosecutors depict a company that allegedly sat on damaging evidence of overcharges from <unk> to <unk> despite warnings from an internal auditor
when <unk> finally disclosed the problems prosecutors contend that <unk> <unk> was erroneously informed that the suspected practices had only just been discovered by <unk> management
in its brief the government asserted that it needs the internal <unk> documents to rebut anticipated efforts by <unk> during the trial to demonstrate its good corporate character
<unk> which was surprised by the last - minute subpoena for more than n boxes and file cabinets of documents countered that senior <unk> managers did n't find out about questionable billing practices until n and that the information was passed on quickly to <unk> <unk> at his first meeting with company representatives
subsequent meetings initiated after the company and two of its units were briefly suspended from federal contracts were held to familiarize <unk> <unk> with the company self - policing procedures and to disclose additional information according to <unk>
<unk> filing contends that the billing practices at the heart of the current controversy involved technical disputes rather than criminal activity
the company conduct does not even raise a question of wrongful corporate intent ratification or cover - up <unk> brief asserts <unk>
on the contrary it shows a corporation reacting swiftly and aggressively to very difficult issues in largely uncharted waters
<unk> <unk> could n't be reached for comment yesterday

savings and loans reject blacks for mortgage loans twice as often as they reject whites the <unk> of <unk> <unk> said <unk>
but that does n't necessarily mean <unk> thrifts are discriminating against blacks the agency said <unk>
the office an arm of the <unk> said n it does n't have data on the financial position of applicants and thus ca n't determine why blacks are rejected more often
nevertheless on <unk> <unk> where the information was released yesterday at a <unk> banking subcommittee hearing lawmakers said <unk> they are worried that financial institutions are routinely discriminating against minorities
they asked regulators to suggest new ways <unk> to force banks and thrifts to comply with anti - discrimination laws
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman of the subcommittee on consumer and regulatory affairs said i not a statistician
but when blacks are getting their loan applications rejected twice as often as whites and in some cities it is three and four times as often i conclude that discrimination is part of the problem
<unk> <unk> a spokesman for the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> said the data is a red flag but lacking the financial data you ca n't make a case that discrimination is widespread
the trade group official added certainly the federal government should take a hard look at it
<unk> <unk> held the hearing to follow up on a provision in the savings and loan bailout bill that required regulators to report on evidence of discimination in mortgage lending
the legislation also requires broad new disclosures of the race sex and income level of borrowers but that information wo n't be gathered in new studies for several months at least
the <unk> <unk> said <unk> its studies in recent years which adjust for income differences and other variables showed that blacks received fewer home mortgages from banks and thrifts than whites
but <unk> <unk> a <unk> governor told the subcommittee n the evidence is mixed and that the <unk> believes <unk> the vast majority of banks are n't discriminating
for instance he noted n the <unk> studies have shown that blacks receive more home improvement loans than whites
several lawmakers were angered that the bank and thrift regulators generally said n they have been too busy handling the record number of bank and thrift failures in the past few years to put much energy into investigating possible discrimination
we would be the first n to admit that we have not devoted the necessary amount of emphasis over the past several years to developing examinations for discrimination said <unk> <unk> a top official of the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
if we got folks out there who are being turned away in the mortgage market improperly and unfairly said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman of the banking committee then that is a matter that needs remedy now not six months from now or six years from now or n years from now
officials of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> said n they have punished only a few banks for violations of anti - discrimination laws
the <unk> said n it has issued five citations to banks over the past three years for discriminatory practices
the comptroller office said n it found no indications of illegal discrimination in <unk> examinations of banks since <unk> n
the comptroller office also said that of <unk> complaints n it received since <unk> <unk> only n alleged racial discrimination in real estate lending
the agency investigated the complaints but no violations were cited
thrift regulators did n't give any figures on their enforcement actions
<unk> <unk> said that among the possibilities being considered by regulators to fight discrimination is the use of testers government investigators who would pose as home buyers
the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> has used testers to investigate discrimination in rental housing

<unk> <unk> <unk> is considering a legal challenge to <unk> - <unk> <unk> plan to buy half of <unk> <unk> <unk> a move that could lead to all - out war between the cable industry two most powerful players
<unk> is also fighting the transaction on other fronts by attempting to discourage other cable operators from joining <unk> - <unk> as investors in <unk> cable - tv industry executives say n
<unk> officials declined to comment
last week <unk> - <unk> agreed to pay <unk> <unk> n million for a <unk> stake in its <unk> subsidiary which is a distant second to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the delivery of pay - tv networks to cable subscribers
<unk> - <unk> the <unk> largest cable company said n it may seek other cable partners <unk> to join in its investment
<unk> - <unk> is <unk> largest customer and the two have a number of other business relationships
earlier this year <unk> even discussed bringing <unk> - <unk> in as an investor in <unk> executives at both companies said <unk>
the purchase of the <unk> stake is a direct slap in our face said n one senior <unk> executive
<unk> is expected to mount a legal challenge in <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> where <unk> in <unk> filed a n billion antitrust suit charging <unk> and <unk> with monopolizing the pay - tv business and trying to crush competition from <unk>
executives involved in plotting time defense say n it is now preparing a countersuit naming both <unk> and <unk> - <unk> as defendants
the executives say <unk> <unk> may seek to break up the transaction after it is consummated or may seek constraints that would prevent <unk> - <unk> from dropping <unk> in any of its cable systems in favor of <unk>
<unk> officials declined to comment
<unk> <unk> <unk> - <unk> chief outside counsel said <unk> he was n't aware of <unk> legal plans
but he said that any effort by <unk> to characterize the <unk> - <unk> investment in <unk> as anti - competitive would be the pot calling the kettle black
it hard to see how an investment by the largest cable operator in the weaker of the two networks is anti - competitive when the stronger of the two networks is owned by the second largest cable operator <unk> <unk> said
in addition to owning <unk> with n million subscribers <unk> <unk> separately operates cable - tv system serving about n million cable - tv subscribers
<unk> - <unk> controls close to n million cable subscribers and <unk> has about one million
in its suit against <unk> <unk> says <unk> the ownership of both cable systems and cable - programming networks gives the company too much market power
<unk> argues that in joining up with <unk> - <unk> <unk> has potentially more power particularly since <unk> also owns cable networks <unk> <unk> and <unk> at <unk>
ironically <unk> - <unk> and <unk> have often worked closely in the cable business
together they control nearly n of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> - <unk> has a <unk> stake while <unk> <unk> has a <unk> stake
but since <unk> merger with <unk> <unk> <unk> relations between the two have become strained
each company worries that the other is becoming too powerful and too vertically integrated
meanwhile some legal observers say <unk> the <unk> - <unk> investment and other developments are weakening <unk> antitrust suit against <unk>
<unk> accuses <unk> in its suit of refusing to carry <unk> or a sister service the <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> tv system one of the nation largest urban systems
but yesterday <unk> <unk> announced <unk> it will launch <unk> on <unk> n to over <unk> subscribers
<unk> has also accused <unk> of locking up the lion share of <unk> movies by signing exclusive contracts with all the major studios
but <unk> has continued to sign new contracts with <unk> studios and yesterday announced n it will buy movies from <unk> pictures <unk> <unk> which currently has a non - exclusive arrangement with <unk>
the <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> it authorized its staff to seek a preliminary injunction barring <unk> <unk> <unk> from acquiring the shares outstanding of the <unk> unit of the british company <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for n million
the <unk> said <unk> it had reason to believe that the proposed acquisition could substantially reduce competition in the production of certain image intensifier tubes which are important components of night - vision devices sold primarily to the defense industry
the <unk> said n it would seek to enjoin the proposed acquisition in a federal trial court but declined to specify which one
under federal law if the court grants a preliminary injunction the <unk> must begin administrative proceedings n to determine the legality of the proposed stock purchase within <unk> days

the airline industry fortunes in dazzling shape for most of the year have taken a sudden turn for the worse in the past few weeks
citing rising fuel costs promotional fare cuts and a general slowdown in travel several major carriers have posted or are expected to post relatively poor third - quarter results
yesterday <unk> <unk> <unk> recently one of the industry stellar performers posted a worse - than-expected n million net loss for the period
so far the industry fourth quarter is n't looking too strong either prompting many analysts to slash earning projections for the rest of the year by as much as one - fourth
and they say n the outlook for <unk> is nearly as bad
airlines in <unk> came in like a bang and are going out like a whimper said <unk> <unk> <unk> an airline analyst at <unk> <unk> <unk>
this turn of events has put a big damper on an industry that seemed almost invincible last spring when fares were rising at double - digit rates and many carriers seemed to be growing fat on near - monopolies in certain markets
now many airline companies might become a lot less attractive as takeover targets on <unk> <unk>
the downturn also raises questions about the carriers ambitious orders for new airplanes which currently total n billion over the next three years
for travelers though the industry problems have had some positive effects
in recent weeks airlines have cut numerous fares in leisure markets to try to win back customers
others have tried to spruce up frequent - flier programs
previously airlines were limiting the programs because they were becoming too expensive
just last week for example <unk> <unk> airlines and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> airways went so far as to offer cash rebates or gift checks of <unk> to <unk> to certain frequent - flier members making trans - <unk> flights in business class or first class
the industry slowdown became apparent this month when <unk> <unk> parent of <unk> <unk> reported an n drop in third - quarter net income and said <unk> its fourth quarter would be disappointing
shortly before that <unk> had said <unk> its third - quarter results would be significantly lower than a year earlier
yesterday it provided the details
its loss of n million or <unk> a share contrasted with net of n million or <unk> a share in the <unk> third quarter
revenue rose only n in the latest period to n billion from n billion
for the nine months the <unk> <unk> company net plunged <unk> to n million or n cents a share from n million or <unk> a share
revenue rose <unk> to n billion from n billion
the results surprised many analysts because <unk> has almost no competition in its <unk> hub and has expanded operations by completing its acquisition of <unk> airlines
shortly after announcing its quarterly loss <unk> stock tumbled n a share
it ended at <unk> down <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> composite trading
nobody was expecting this size of a loss said <unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk> <unk>
one airline executive who declined to be identified called the loss amazing
in announcing the results <unk> cited many of the same problems that several other industry officials have named recently
it said <unk> the industry domestic traffic was flat in the third quarter analysts say n this was because hefty fare increases earlier in the year scared off many leisure travelers this summer
to try to combat the traffic slowdown airlines started reducing fares average fares rose only n in <unk> in contrast to increases of <unk> each in <unk> and <unk>
but so far the effort has failed and traffic is still slow
some other fare promotions have backfired
this summer the industry introduced a kids fly free program in which children were allowed to fly free if they were traveling with an adult
airlines tried to restrict the program substantially by limiting the offer to certain days of the week but it still was apparently used far more heavily than the airlines expected n
airlines also say n their frequent - flier programs are squeezing profits because awards are being redeemed at a heavier - than-normal rate
one airline official said <unk> about three times as many free - travel coupons are being turned in as in previous years not surprisingly as the airlines last year allowed many travelers to build up mileage at triple the normal rate
rising operating expenses are another problem
fuel costs were up n in the third quarter
labor costs which leveled off in the past few years because of lower pay scales for newer employees are on the upswing again at many carriers
and some carriers are facing other unexpected headaches <unk> for example blamed some of its loss on merger expenses and on disruptions caused by <unk> <unk> last month
we can not quantify the total adverse effects of <unk> said <unk> <unk> chairman and president of <unk> <unk>
whatever the cause for the downturn few people are predicting any sudden improvement
<unk> <unk> <unk> an aviation consulting firm is projecting an industrywide operating profit of <unk> billion for n compared with earlier forecasts of <unk> billion to n billion
as for <unk> the firm predicts n that profit will slip to between <unk> billion and n billion
good grief
<unk> <unk> is selling out
those <unk> <unk> ads were bad enough
but now <unk> <unk> is about to start pitching everything from <unk> <unk> <unk> to light bulbs
why is he cashing in now
turns out that next year <unk> <unk> <unk> and the gang turn <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> unit the syndicator and licensing agent for <unk> <unk> comic strip sees a bonanza in licensing the cartoon characters to a bevy of advertisers for ads tie - ins and promotions
peanuts has become a major part of american culture says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> vice president of marketing and licensing
the comic strip has a magical everlasting quality about it
our plan is to honor <unk> <unk> and the strip all year long
the effort will make the peanuts gang very familiar pitchmen in <unk>
<unk> <unk> plans to use the characters to plug its <unk> light bulb
<unk> will run tv ads at <unk> <unk> promoting its <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> will promote its <unk> <unk> <unk> three new flavor packets named for <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
the characters will also be featured in a new public service effort for the <unk> <unk>
beyond the advertisements the syndicator is planning a traveling arena show new tv specials for <unk> and even an exhibit at the <unk> <unk>
the yearlong schedule of festivities will be kicked off officially with a combination live and animation half - time special at the <unk> <unk> in <unk>
all the tie - ins though have some marketing experts questioning whether the party may go too far
there are too many people participating says <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> marketing consulting firm
if you want to cut through the clutter you have to make your message as distinct sharp and individual as possible
sharing a character with other advertisers is n't a way n to do that
but <unk> <unk> says n it very scrupulous with the contracts n it hands out
we not interested in promoting every single product that comes along <unk> <unk> says
<unk> <unk> ad executives could n't be reached about the use of the peanuts characters by others
but <unk> <unk> says n that company exclusive advertising rights extend only to the insurance and financial services category

he predicted n the debt will be reduced by another <unk> n billion this fiscal year ending <unk> <unk> <unk> but did n't explain how this will be achieved
<unk> <unk> blamed rising australian interest rates and the acquisition of <unk> <unk> with its very high levels of shortterm debt for producing a condition that was no longer sustainable
in order to restore confidence and ensure the support of our principal lenders <unk> <unk> said we embarked on fundamantal changes in the structure and direction of the group
that reassessment resulted in continuing asset sales as well as write - offs exceeding a$ n billion last fiscal year

a year ago the <unk> glass products and aluminum window maker earned n million or n cents a share on revenue of n million
<unk> said <unk> the charge stems from a building supply contract in which the company guaranteed a contractor performance
<unk> said <unk> a subcontractor had severe cost overruns and was unable to fulfill the contract terms on its own making it necessary for <unk> to advance cash to ensure completion of the project
the company said <unk> its core businesses have performed well and it expects them to continue to do so in the remainder of the fiscal year
<unk> production of cars trucks and buses in <unk> fell n from a year ago to n units because of a slip in exports the <unk> <unk> manufacturers <unk> said <unk>

the association said n domestic demand grew <unk> in <unk>
demand has been growing consistently under the encouragement of pro - consumption government policies an association spokesman said n

stock of <unk> <unk> parent <unk> <unk> gyrated wildly yesterday amid speculation that one or more investors may challenge the <unk> board decision to remain independent instead of pursuing a buy - out or other transaction
the board decision announced after the market closed <unk> initially prompted a severe sell - off in <unk> shares which at midday traded as low as <unk> a share down <unk> a share in composite trading on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the deepening bloodbath for takeover - stock traders who by then had seen <unk> stock tumble n since <unk> <unk> also triggered a marketwide sell - off that sent the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> down more than n points at n a.m
but then steady concentrated buying by <unk> <unk> <unk> which frequently buys stock for corporate raiders took hold and steadied the fall in <unk> which eventually buoyed the entire market
the industrial average closed down only n points at <unk>
late in the afternoon several big purchases by <unk> <unk> particularly a block of n shares at n p.m. at <unk> a share triggered a buying spree that took <unk> up more than <unk> points in the final hour of trading
<unk> stock closed at <unk> a share down n
volume was a tumultuous n million shares or n of the n million <unk> shares outstanding
traders estimated that <unk> <unk> bought more than n million shares
the two most frequently rumored buyers neither of whom would comment were <unk> partners which battled the <unk> board in <unk> and <unk> <unk> real estate developer <unk> <unk> who recently made and withdrew an offer for <unk> <unk> parent <unk> <unk>
however one person familiar with <unk> said n the signs pointed to <unk> because <unk> <unk> has n't asked for permission to buy more than n million of stock under federal antitrust rules
takeover - stock traders stung by their huge losses in <unk> stock remained eager for some action by an outside catalyst following the collapse <unk> n of a <unk> <unk> billion labor - management buy - out
their hope was that the catalyst would seek to oust the board in a solicitation of shareholder consents
<unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> takeover - stock trader that owns <unk> stock would n't comment on reports n the firm is considering seeking such a shareholder vote
but partner <unk> <unk> said this is the most extraordinary failed transaction n i seen in n years in this business
it would make sense for somebody to do it
i have never seen a case of incompetence shared by so many participants
in <unk> <unk> <unk> waged a proxy fight for control of <unk> <unk> <unk> that ultimately led to <unk> being sold
some traders pointed hopefully to earlier estimates by <unk> investment adviser <unk> <unk> <unk> that recapitalizations could yield <unk> to n a share
but those would require pilots cooperation
any investor who acquires <unk> stock in an attempt to force a buy - out or recapitalization must deal with <unk> contentious unions
the pilots are working under an expired contract and the machinists contract expires next month
that gives them enormous leverage including the threat of a strike n to block any buy - out or recapitalization attempt n they oppose
however a catalyst like <unk> could seek shareholder support for a sale to a labor - management group at the last price discussed by that group before the board meeting <unk>
the pilots had been working on a buy - out bid between <unk> and <unk> a share or n billion to <unk> billion
one person familiar with <unk> said n the unsettled labor situation and the uncertain world - wide financial markets contributed to the board decision to avoid rushing around selling the company at a bargain price particularly since it accepted a <unk> offer just last month
even some takeover - stock traders said <unk> they could n't quarrel with the board logic
but the board decision prompted many to bail out of the stock yesterday
we had a lot of people who threw in the towel today said <unk> <unk> a partner in <unk> <unk> <unk> a specialist in trading <unk> stock on the <unk> <unk>
another trader noted that many arbitrage firms are afraid to sell their <unk> stock at the bottom but already own so much n they ca n't buy any more
this deal is like a <unk> <unk> he said
they check in but they ca n't check out
but both the traders and the pilots remain interested in some transaction
so too according to many reports is british <unk> <unk> despite its public withdrawal from the buy - out
the pilots might end up teaming up with their longtime adversaries the machinists union in a recapitalization
the machinists are reviewing proposals <unk> they made in the past for recapitalizations that would pay a special shareholder dividend and give employees a minority stake
the company rejected those past proposals
it is unclear however if the machinists would support a majority stake as the pilots want
a machinist official said <unk> that would depend on how much in concessions machinists would have to give in return for the majority stake
some investors whose names were bandied about by traders as potential <unk> stock buyers said n they were n't buying
i not interested said <unk> investor <unk> <unk>
a source close to <unk> <unk> a corporate raider who owns <unk> <unk> airlines <unk> said n he has n't owned any <unk> stock and is n't buying
one person familiar with <unk> billionaire <unk> <unk> said <unk> he is n't likely to make any hostile moves
and a spokesman for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which had held n of <unk> before the first buy - out bid but later reduced its holdings below <unk> would n't comment
<unk> <unk> whose <unk> billion takeover bid originally put the nation second - largest airline in play is limited by a standstill agreement with <unk> n he signed in <unk>
the <unk> <unk> investor ca n't buy <unk> stock solicit shareholder consents or make a new offer unless he makes a formal offer of <unk> a share or <unk> accepts an offer below <unk>
however <unk> <unk> could pressure the board by asking that the agreement be waived or letting it be known that he has financing for an offer at a lower price
<unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> third - quarter net income fell <unk> to n million or n cents a share compared with net income of n million or n cents a share a year earlier
the <unk> <unk> media concern said that the year - ago period included a n million gain from the sale of assets primarily timberlands
revenue was n million up <unk> from n million
stronger results from the company broadcast and cable television units and professional and textbook publishing divisions plus increased advertising at the company largest newspaper the <unk> <unk> <unk> offset advertising declines in the company newspapers in the <unk> <unk> the company said n
looking ahead to the fourth quarter the outlook for the newspaper group remains guarded with no improvement yet seen in operating trends in our eastern markets said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman and chief executive
copper futures sold off sharply yesterday influenced by declines in the stock market and dollar and a rally in bonds
<unk> copper opened near <unk> close tried to rally but failed and then triggered stop - loss orders on its way down to settle at <unk> a pound off n cents for the day
stop - loss orders are placed previously with instructions to execute them if the market hits a predetermined price
<unk> <unk> president of the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> said n the decline was almost certainly influenced by the early sell - off in the stock market which partly reflected a weakening economy
he said n the recent decline in copper stocks was misleading in the face of a slowdown in manufacturing
<unk> <unk> said n traders could have picked up signals of an imminent price decline had they been watching the scrap metal markets which became noticeably weaker two to three weeks ago
but though a weakening economy implies reduced demand <unk> <unk> said that <unk> <unk> copper - producing countries have n't any choice but to sell copper
they might even step up sales in a falling market he said n in an effort to maintain the flow of foreign exchange into their treasuries
technically <unk> <unk> noted that a lot of traders had bought into the market when the price was in the <unk> to n range thinking n there was support at the <unk> level
when the market fell below that level on <unk> and then yesterday could n't climb above that level traders started selling out their positions
<unk> <unk> senior metals analyst at <unk> - <unk> securities in <unk> <unk> agreed that most of the selling was of a technical nature
she said n the market hit the <unk> level at around n a.m. <unk> where it encountered a large number of stop - loss orders
more stop - loss orders were touched off all the way down to below <unk> where modest buying was attracted
<unk> <unk> said <unk> the settling of strikes in <unk> and <unk> will have little effect on supplies of copper until early next year
she thinks <unk> the next area of support for copper is in the <unk> to n range
i believe that as soon as the selling abates somewhat we could see a rally back to the <unk> region she added
she thinks n a recovery in the stock market would help copper rebound as well
she noted that the preliminary estimate of the third - quarter gross national product is due out tomorrow and is expected to be up about <unk> to n
if the number is a little better then copper will respond positively if it is worse then more selling could ensue she predicted
<unk> <unk> noted that relating economic numbers to specific market activity is tricky
yesterday for example the durable goods numbers came out for <unk> and the number was down only n she said
however if you exclude defense - related orders then durable goods were down n
i believe n that number reflects a slowing economy
she said n copper traders will also be looking toward the release of the index of leading economic indicators next <unk>
however <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> an international metals company noted that so far this year copper consumption is way ahead of the same period of <unk> and that projected production is below last year
<unk> <unk> said <unk> the copper market seems to be anticipating a recession in three months with declining use being the result
but he added we have had that exact same perception six times in the last six years
he noted that currently the ratio of available copper to consumption is about n weeks
he said <unk> the normal ratio is five to six weeks
according to <unk> <unk> the bottleneck in copper production is n't at the mines but at the copper refineries
it takes three months to turn copper concentrate into cathodes he said
if there is n't a recession he said n we will be out of copper by the end of <unk>
if there is a recession that will change the statistical situation
he thinks that without a recession copper prices could exceed a high of <unk> a pound which was reached last year
in the past <unk> <unk> has been known to have substantial long positions that is he had bought copper futures in anticipation of rising prices in the copper futures market
in other commodity markets yesterday
energy the attitude was wait - and-see in crude oil futures yesterday in trading on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
prices for the <unk> benchmark <unk> <unk> <unk> crude remained locked in a fairly narrow range before ending the session four cents lower at <unk> a barrel for <unk> delivery
several analysts and brokers said n the petroleum market was ready to rally after two days of price declines from profit - taking
but an early n drop in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> stopped the crude rally cold
the industrial average recovered to close only n points lower but petroleum futures never shook off the chill
most market participants said n they were looking to this week inventory statistics from the <unk> <unk> <unk> to give the market some direction
the report is n't generally available until late on tuesdays
precious metals futures prices inched upward in mostly lackluster trading
<unk> gold was up n an ounce at n <unk> silver gained <unk> cents to n an ounce
<unk> platinum rose n an ounce to <unk>
<unk> <unk> said n there were no fundamental factors moving these markets
he noted that two weeks ago there were rumors of soviet sales of precious metals n to finance grain purchases but the sales do n't seem to have materialized
<unk> <unk> thought <unk> yesterday price action reflected weakness in the stock market and the dollar
gold still acts as a haven when uncertainty prevails in the financial markets as it did yesterday she said
<unk> <unk> noted that gold was more than <unk> times the price of silver at the close yesterday which is historically high
the high ratio reflects the fact that silver is still regarded as about a half - industrial metal and its price lagging relative to gold says that traders are expecting a weakening economy he said
grains and soybeans prices closed lower after trading in relatively narrow ranges because of strong selling in the cash market and continued favorable harvest weather
the sale to the chinese government of <unk> metric tons of wheat under the government export enhancement program was announced after the close of trading <unk> but the sale was expected and failed to buoy prices yesterday said <unk> <unk> <unk> a futures analyst with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>
as for other export customers the <unk> <unk> is n't expected to be back buying <unk> corn in significant amounts until early next year he said n
a number of commercial grain users buttressed that opinion yesterday by buying certain corn options for delivery in <unk> indicating to analysts that the commercial companies would use the options to hedge against expected corn sales in next year first quarter
cocoa futures at first continued the rally begun on <unk> but then faltered and closed lower
the <unk> contract opened just under <unk> close triggered some previously placed buy orders just above n a metric ton pushing the price to <unk> and then encountered heavy selling by traders who buy and sell for their own accounts and by commercial interests
the contract settled at <unk> a ton off <unk>
<unk> <unk> senior commodities analyst at <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> rally continued yesterday for only about <unk> minutes after the opening
he said <unk> even though there was arbitrage buying in <unk> <unk> because of the weak dollar cocoa fell to relentless pressure from bearish traders
but he noted that speculators apparently do n't believe n there is much more of a decline in store for cocoa
the <unk> contract reached its life - of-contract low of <unk> a ton on <unk> n its lifetime high was n set in <unk> and its recent high was <unk> set in early <unk>
the last time <unk> cocoa traded at prices as low as currently was in <unk>
but while further modest declines might be ahead <unk> <unk> said n it would be difficult to get through resistance levels just above yesterday high
citizens <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> it agreed to buy <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> bank holding company for about n million in cash and stock
citizens <unk> which controls citizens <unk> <unk> <unk> and is based in <unk> <unk> <unk> will pay a maximum of <unk> in cash for the parent of <unk> <unk> <unk> and the remainder in convertible preferred stock with a liquidation value of <unk> a share
<unk> holders will have the option to request either stock or cash
the convertible preferred will pay dividends at n and be convertible into shares of citizens first at a rate equal to <unk> above the average closing price of the stock during a n period prior to the transaction completion
the deal requires regulatory and shareholder approval
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> its major creditor <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> agreed to convert n million of debt owed into <unk> of <unk> <unk> fully diluted common stock
the agreement also calls for <unk> <unk> <unk> a unit of <unk> <unk> <unk> to receive as much as <unk> of <unk> systems fully diluted common stock depending on the proceeds from the sale of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and its receivables
<unk> <unk> <unk> took control of the <unk> library last month after <unk> systems defaulted on the loan
the agreement depends on <unk> <unk> ability to win similar concessions from other creditors
<unk> <unk> president said <unk> the company expects to conclude negotiations with other creditors within <unk> days
<unk> <unk> which converts black - and-white film to color videotape posted a loss of n million or <unk> a share on revenue of n million for the fiscal year ended <unk> <unk>
its stock fell n cents to n in <unk> <unk> <unk> composite trading yesterday
next to <unk> <unk> <unk> megabillion <unk> <unk> deal <unk> <unk> is small fry
but the troubles of <unk> <unk> are a classic tale of the leveraged buy - out excesses of the <unk> especially the asset - stripping game
<unk> <unk> which expects to release a plan to restructure n billion of debt in the next day or so is n't just another <unk> that went bad after piling on debt though it did do that
the cable and tv station company was an <unk> of an <unk> a set of assets that were leveraged twice enabling the blue - chip buy - out king <unk> <unk> in <unk> to take more than <unk> billion of cash out of the com pany
<unk> <unk> buy - out was an ace in the hole for <unk> <unk> and for investors in <unk> partnerships
but it has left holders of <unk> <unk> junk bonds holding the bag including some heavyweights that <unk> might need to finance future deals such as <unk> <unk> services <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>
some junk - holders are said to be considering legal action against <unk> or moves to force <unk> <unk> into bankruptcy court
and <unk> majority partner in <unk> <unk> buy - out <unk> <unk> entrepreneur <unk> <unk> also is said to be very unhappy
<unk> <unk> six stations once were part of <unk> communications
<unk> loaded up the cable and television company with debt in an <unk> buy - out then later sold <unk> cable operations at a fat profit
in <unk> <unk> for the second time piled debt onto <unk> tv stations selling them for n billion to a new entity that was n by <unk> and <unk> by <unk> <unk> which now operates the <unk> <unk> stations
in this second <unk> <unk> with one hand took more than <unk> billion of cash out of the tv company assets and moved it into the <unk> cable operations making them more valuable in a n sale
<unk> also took n million of junior <unk> <unk> bonds as partial payment for the tv assets
with the other hand <unk> put back into <unk> <unk> less than n of the cash n it had taken out buying <unk> <unk> common and preferred shares
so while <unk> today has an estimated n million sunk in now - shaky <unk> tv including equity and debt the <unk> firm still is n billion ahead on the <unk> <unk> buy - out after taking cash up front
on <unk> as a whole <unk> racked up compound annual returns of <unk> in the three years n it owned <unk>
meanwhile <unk> <unk> risks losing his entire equity investment of about n million in <unk> <unk> if the company ca n't be restructured
overall <unk> <unk> holding company <unk> holdings is heavily indebted and except for its <unk> <unk> resorts is n't doing very well
with the tv business falling on hard times in recent years analysts say that if <unk> <unk> had to be liquidated today it might fetch <unk> less than in the <unk> buy - out wiping out most of the company junk - holders and its stockholders
meanwhile <unk> <unk> can barely pay its cash interest bill and to stay out of bankruptcy court it must soon reschedule a lot of bank loans and junk bonds that have fallen due
<unk> <unk> grace period for paying its bills is due to expire <unk> n
it now is quietly circulating among creditors a preliminary plan to restructure debt
negotiations have started con structively but that not to say n we like this particular offer says <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> adviser to <unk> <unk> junk - holders
no major player in the <unk> <unk> deal will talk publicly
but it understood that <unk> <unk> is disappointed that <unk> <unk> did n't manage to boost <unk> <unk> operating profit after the buy - out
<unk> <unk> apparently thinks <unk> <unk> <unk> can survive if lenders extend its debt payments until tv stations rise in value again allowing <unk> <unk> to sell assets to pay debt
<unk> <unk> is said to be proud of his operating record he has lifted some stations ratings and turned around a <unk> station
as for junk - holders they discovering n it can be a mistake to take the other side of a trade by <unk>
the bonds of <unk> <unk> now are being quoted at prices ranging from only five cents to about n cents on the dollar according to <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> which trades distressed securities
people who have seen <unk> <unk> restructuring plan say n it offers concessions by <unk> and <unk> <unk>
they would both give part of their combined n million in common equity in <unk> <unk> to holders of <unk> <unk> n million of junk bonds as a carrot n to persuade them to accept new bonds that might reduce the value of their claims on the company
but some militant <unk> <unk> junk - holders say n that not enough
they contend that <unk> <unk> equity now is worthless
they add that it is n't costing <unk> anything to give up equity because of its big up - front cash profit on the buy - out which they think n contributed to <unk> <unk> current problems
<unk> the biggest holder of senior <unk> <unk> bonds has refused to join the bond - holders committee and is said to be reviewing its legal options
to protect their claims some junk - holders want <unk> and perhaps <unk> <unk> to invest new money in <unk> <unk> perhaps n million or more
one investment banker who is n't involved in the deal says <unk> <unk> <unk> needs at least n million of new equity to survive
junk - holders say n they have a stick n to beat <unk> with the threat of bankruptcy is a legitimate tool n to extract money from <unk> says n one big <unk> <unk> holder
this could be the first major bankruptcy - law proceeding for <unk> he adds n
a big bankruptcy - court case might tarnish <unk> name and provide new fuel for critics of <unk> in <unk> and elsewhere
but others say n junk - holders have nothing <unk> to gain by putting <unk> <unk> into bankruptcy - law proceedings
while <unk> does n't control <unk> <unk> which is unusual for a <unk> investment it clearly has much deeper pockets than <unk> <unk>
bankruptcy specialists say <unk> <unk> <unk> set a precedent for putting new money in sour lbos recently when <unk> restructured foundering <unk> <unk> doubling <unk> equity stake
but with <unk> <unk> was only trying to salvage its original investment says <unk> bankruptcy investor <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
by contrast <unk> probably has already made all the money n it can on <unk> <unk>
and people who know <unk> <unk> say n he is n't in a hurry to pour more money into <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> reflecting strong earnings growth boosted its quarterly dividend <unk> to n cents a share from n cents
the maker of household products said n the new dividend is payable <unk> n to shares of record <unk> n
separately the company board adopted a proposal to amend its n shareholder rights plan further insulating the company from takeover
<unk> officials said n they are n't aware of any effort to take over the company but believed <unk> the shareholder plan needed to be strengthened
the board has stated repeatedly that <unk> should be independent said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> president
some changes to the plan were minor adjustments but the most significant was an amendment that provides that if any investor holds n or more of <unk> voting securities each right held by others would entitle the holder to buy <unk> shares with a market value of twice the right exercise price
<unk> <unk> said <unk> the exercise price is <unk> meaning <unk> holders would have the right to buy <unk> of <unk> stock for half price diluting the investor <unk> stake
for the third quarter <unk> earned n million or n cents a share up n from n million or n cents a share a year earlier
sales rose <unk> to n million from n million
<unk> shares closed yesterday at <unk> off n cents in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> composite trading
the stock market went on a dizzying ride as <unk> parent of <unk> <unk> once again led shares into a breathtaking decline and then an afternoon comeback
at the end of it all the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> closed down n to n
at one point yesterday morning the <unk> was down n points
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> volume was n shares
declining issues swamped advancers <unk> to n
yesterday sell - off and rebound was a powerful reminder that <unk> days after the n plunge on <unk> the n the stock market still has a bad case of nerves
takeover stock speculation and futures - related program trading drove the industrial average through wide ranges
and there is more volatility to come
<unk> n left us with a cut and exposed nerve said <unk> <unk> technical analyst for <unk> <unk>
people are fearful and sensitive
everybody finger is one inch closer to the button
i have never had as many calls as i had this morning
volatility is here to stay
the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> plunged about n points in slightly more than one hour after the opening bell
for many it began to look like a replay of <unk> n
as stocks and stock - index futures fell a trading limit was hit in the <unk> <unk> stock futures pit
under a <unk> crash reform the <unk> <unk> <unk> would n't permit the <unk> <unk> futures to fall further than n points for a half hour
that caused a brief period of panic selling of stocks on the <unk> <unk>
but at a critical moment stock - index arbitrage traders showed their power and control
they scooped up hundreds of <unk> futures when the market needed it most
at about n a.m. <unk> several big buy orders hit the <unk> pit simultaneously lifting the futures up out of the trading limit and eventually into ranges that caused computer - driven program buying of stocks
it is very clear that those buy orders came from people who wanted their franchise protected said one <unk> - based futures trader
these guys wanted to do something to show how powerful they are
traders said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> brothers were the main force behind the futures buying at the pivotal moment
<unk> <unk> <unk> declined to comment
officials at <unk> <unk> and <unk> brothers were unavailable for comment
as in the <unk> <unk> massacre yesterday morning drop was triggered by bad news for speculators in <unk>
a <unk> statement after the market closed <unk> indicated that the airline board wanted to keep the company independent effectively crushing hopes of an immediate buy - out
five minutes before the <unk> <unk> opened a preliminary price was flashed for <unk> somewhere between <unk> and <unk> a loss of as much as <unk> a share from <unk> close
<unk> finally opened for trading at <unk> <unk> at <unk> down <unk>
floor traders said n there was a huge crowd around the <unk> <unk> specialist post where <unk> trades
there was a seething mass of people said one floor trader
then there was a big liquidation of stock across the board he added
takeover speculators who have already taken a record loss estimated at more than n million on <unk> started selling other stocks as well as <unk> futures in an attempt to hedge against a further <unk> blood bath
shortly after the <unk> opening program traders started selling stocks in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> index
the <unk> <unk> mimics the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
by <unk> <unk> the <unk> was down <unk>
all n in the <unk> except <unk> <unk> motors and <unk> were down <unk> to n
at <unk> when the <unk> <unk> <unk> futures contract crunched to a <unk> loss under the force of sell programs <unk> futures trading was halted and program trades on the <unk> <unk> were routed into a special computer that scans for order imbalances
under the rules adopted by the <unk> <unk> <unk> the futures contract can not drop below the limit but buyers can purchase futures
at this point the <unk> industrials were down n points and falling
the trading halt in the <unk> <unk> futures exacerbated selling and confusion many traders maintain n
but as the fright began to spread through the <unk> pit the big brokerage firms came in and bought futures aggressively
it was whooosh said one futures trader
in five minutes the <unk> industrials climbed almost n points
the big futures buying triggered stock - index buy programs that eventually trimmed the <unk> loss to n points by n a.m
traders said <unk> the futures buying was finely calculated by program traders
these firms sold stock into the big morning decline but seeing the velocity of the market drop held back on their offsetting purchases of futures until the <unk> futures hit the trading limit
then they completed the other side of the trade by buying futures which abruptly halted the stock market decline as traders began to buy stocks
from then on the <unk> industrials held at a loss of <unk> to <unk> points
then in late - afternoon trading hundred - thousand-share buy orders for <unk> hit the market including a n order through <unk> <unk> that seemed to spark <unk> late price surge
almost simultaneously <unk> began a very visible buy program for dozens of stocks
the combined buying rallied the <unk> into a small gain before closing at a slight loss
some institutional traders loved the wild ride
this is fun asserted <unk> <unk> <unk> head equity trader at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
she said n she used the market wild swings to buy shares cheaply on the sell - off
on the comeback <unk> <unk> <unk> unloaded shares n she has been aiming to get rid of
but traders who risk money handling big blocks of stock were shaken
this market is eating away my youth said <unk> <unk> head equity trader at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
credibility sounds intangible
but i think n we are losing credibility because when the market does this it does n't present itself as a rational investment
but if you overlook all this it is a beautiful market for investment still
traders attributed rallies in a number of stocks to a japanese buy program that <unk> carried out as part of a shift in portfolio strategy according to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> climbed <unk> <unk> to <unk> on very heavy volume of n shares
analysts said <unk> a big japanese buy order was behind the rise
a <unk> <unk> spokesman said n there were no corporate developments that would account for the activity
other issues said to be included in the buy program were <unk> <unk> which rose n <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which gained <unk> to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> which jumped <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk>

child
there was very slow play on the market today they were selling and buying by halves instead of trading like bears and bulls they behaved like cubs and calves
<unk> <unk> <unk>
i learned one thing from candidates a technique so deftly done if a question ca n't be answered strongly answer an unasked one
<unk> <unk>
we need to get a space platform set up soon just in case we want to step out for a breath of fresh air

after being whipsawed by a volatile stock market <unk> bonds closed higher
but junk bonds took more hits
early in the day bond dealers said n trading volume was heavy as large institutional investors scrambled to buy long - term <unk> bonds on speculation that the stock market volatility would lead to a flight - to-quality rally
that happens when nervous stock investors dump equities and buy treasurys which are higher in quality and thus considered safe
some retail accounts such as commercial banks and pension funds wanted to get on the bandwagon before it was too late said <unk> <unk> <unk> chief economist at <unk> <unk> <unk>
at one point the <unk> <unk> <unk> average fell about n points on news that <unk> <unk> decided to remain independent
in response <unk> prices soared n <unk> points or about n for each <unk> face amount
but the gains in <unk> bonds were pared as stocks staged a partial recovery
the industrial average ended at <unk> down n points
economists said <unk> the bond market strength also is a sign that investors expect the <unk> <unk> to cut interest rates amid growing evidence that the economy is slowing
while they do n't expect the <unk> to move right away they say n the case for lower rates is building
yesterday for example the <unk> <unk> reported that new orders for durable goods fell n while the nation auto makers reported lackluster mid - <unk> sales
the <unk> <unk> bond ended over <unk> point higher
municipal mortgage - backed and investment - grade corporate bonds rose n to n point
but high - yield high - risk bonds fell n to n point with the stock market early in the session and never recovered
according to a trader at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the hardest hit junk bonds were those issued by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which are the easiest to sell
<unk> <unk> bonds due n fell <unk> <unk> points
trading activity in the junk market was extremely light as dealers could n't find enough buyers n to match sellers
while the stock market was falling most junk bond holders were just watching it not knowing what to do said <unk> <unk> director of fixed - income securities at <unk> <unk> <unk>
it was like driving down the highway watching a wreck
everybody was rubber - necking
adding to the junk market jitters were reports that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is having trouble structuring a <unk> billion offering for <unk> <unk> services <unk> and will postpone or even cancel the issue
tw is the largest franchisee of <unk> a fast - food restaurant and operates several other food chains
<unk> <unk> would n't comment
credit analysts said n investors are nervous about the issue because they say n the company ability to meet debt payments is dependent on too many variables including the sale of assets and the need to mortgage property to retire some existing debt
also the <unk> offering includes interest - deferred and pay - in-kind securities which are currently unpopular
meanwhile investors turned a cold shoulder to the <unk> sale of <unk> billion of new two - year notes yesterday
it not too surprising that the auction was sloppy given the volatility in the bond market because of stocks said <unk> <unk> <unk> a senior vice president at <unk> <unk> <unk>
people are looking past supply to lower interest rates but they also worried about being whipsawed by the volatility in the stock market
the new two - year notes were priced with an average yield of <unk>
that was higher than the <unk> to <unk> average yield that traders had expected
in when - issued trading the notes were quoted at a price n to yield n
sluggish demand was also evidenced by the weak <unk> bid - to-cover ratio which was lower than the average <unk> ratio at the last <unk> similar auctions
the ratio which reflects the number of bids n the <unk> receives for each bid accepted is used to gauge investor demand
dealers said n players shied away from the note sale because they were concerned that prices at the time of the auction might erode if the stock market staged a recovery which in fact did happen
individual and japanese participation in the auction was disappointing according to dealers
interest by japanese investors was limited said <unk> <unk> chief economist at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
they are typically not active in two - year note auctions but today participation could be viewed as lighter - than-normal
however <unk> <unk> added that the <unk> generally have a positive view of the <unk> bond market because of expectations that the dollar will remain strong and interest rates will decline
he said possibly they waiting to buy at the quarterly refunding of government debt <unk> to be held next month by the <unk>
a trader at a japanese firm estimated that the japanese purchased no more than n of the two - year notes
<unk> <unk>
today investors will focus on the long - awaited auction of <unk> billion of <unk> bonds by <unk> <unk> <unk>
the initial bond offering by the new government agency which was created to help rescue the nation troubled thrifts is n't expected to see robust demand
a small yield premium over comparable treasurys and a lack of liquidity is hampering dealers efforts to drum up interest in the so - called bailout bonds
in when - issued trading the <unk> bonds were quoted at a price n to yield n
yesterday the benchmark <unk> bond was quoted late at <unk> <unk> <unk> to yield n compared with <unk> <unk> <unk> to yield n on <unk>
the latest <unk> <unk> was quoted at <unk> <unk> <unk> to yield n compared with <unk> <unk> <unk> to yield n
short - term rates were unchanged to slightly lower
the discount rate on three - month <unk> bills was quoted at <unk> for a bond - equivalent yield of n while the rate on six - month <unk> bills was quoted at <unk> for a yield of <unk>
rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value
thus higher bidding narrows the investor return while lower bidding widens it
corporate
several blue - chip companies tapped the new - issue market yesterday to take advantage of falling interest rates
three of the largest offerings by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> were underwritten by groups led by <unk> brothers <unk>
<unk> <unk> long - rumored to be a potential debt issuer offered n million of n notes priced to yield n
<unk> issued n million of seven - year notes priced to yield n and <unk> priced <unk> million of six - year notes to yield n
meanwhile <unk> <unk> machines <unk> paved the way for a visit to the credit markets by filing a shelf registration with the securities and <unk> <unk> for n million in new debt
this is in addition to <unk> existing shelf registration under which n million in debt securities are available for issuance
in secondary trading investment - grade corporate bonds ended <unk> to n higher
actively traded municipal bonds ended <unk> to <unk> point higher in brisk trading despite a flood of new supply
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> issue of <unk> finished n point stronger at <unk> <unk> bid n to yield n
traders said <unk> municipals were underpinned by influences including the climb in <unk> issue prices
also municipal bonds lured buying because the stock market remains wobbly traders contended n

genetic defect spotted in n
researchers diagnosed a genetic defect in a three - day-old mouse embryo in an experiment directly applicable to humans
prenatal diagnosis of genetic defects as early as the sixth week of pregnancy is increasingly common today
but the mouse experiment at a <unk> <unk> <unk> laboratory in <unk> shows n genetic defects can be detected three days after conception using a new <unk> - developed gene - copying technique
the experiment applicable to many genetic disorders involved beta - thalassemia a severe blood anemia resulting from a missing hemoglobin gene
it an inherited human disorder that been duplicated in mice
in the experiment mice with the defective gene were mated
three days later before the new embryo had become implanted in the uterus it was washed out of the mother mouse
the embryo had progressed only to a clump of eight identical cells
one cell was teased out and its <unk> extracted
using the new technique developed by <unk> <unk> called the polymerase chain reaction the scientists rapidly made millions of copies of the section of <unk> that ordinarily contains the hemoglobin gene providing enough copies n to test
a genetic probe showed <unk> the hemoglobin gene was missing the researchers report n in the medical journal <unk>
in the report two molecular biologists suggest <unk> such embryo diagnosis can be used by couples at high risk of passing a genetic defect to a child
for example infertile couples who have the woman eggs fertilized in the test tube usually have several eggs fertilized at a time
when the fertilized cells divide to eight cells a single cell from each embryo can be tested for genetic defects
a healthy embryo can be picked for implantation and defective ones discarded
or in other couples the embryo could be temporarily taken out and tested three days after conception and returned if healthy or discarded if not

it also could convert glucose from farm wastes into edible protein
single - cell protein never panned out and most companies abandoned such research
but <unk> persisted calling in scientists from the <unk> <unk>
they now adapted the yeast to making genetically engineered drugs
like the bacteria used by genetic engineers the yeast can take in human genes and churn out human proteins for medical use
but the yeast genetic apparatus is more like that of animals than the bacterial genetic apparatus
thus the proteins from the yeast are molecularly more like human proteins than those from bacteria
the oil company claims n its yeast system also is better than bacteria at high - volume production of genetically engineered drugs

he said <unk> some infected cells may not have the relevant antigen and so would n't be killed even after exposure to the antibody
the results seem to be very premature said <unk> <unk> editor of <unk> <unk> a leading japanese industry newsletter
<unk> <unk> responded that he thought n the antibody could potentially kill all infected cells
but he and <unk> <unk> said n there were still several uncertainties particularly regarding possible side effects

a n million n million <unk> <unk> <unk> rights issue flopped badly the victim of recent market turbulence and the collapse of the buy - out bid for <unk> <unk> parent <unk> <unk>
the <unk> <unk> carrier had planned the issue to help finance its n million purchase of a <unk> stake in <unk>
but <unk> <unk> withdrew from the <unk> labor - management buy - out plan last <unk> after the group failed to get bank financing for its n billion buy - out
<unk> <unk> said <unk> its shareholders accepted only n of the convertible capital bonds but that the rest of the issue will be taken up by underwriters
analysts said <unk> that <unk> level marked the poorest showing for any major british rights issue since the <unk> global stock market crash
it is close to being a record undersubscription said <unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> broker <unk> <unk> <unk> securities
fund managers do n't like to have rights issues that do n't have an obvious reason
the obvious reason was for british <unk> to buy a stake in <unk> <unk>
in a statement british <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> the company was obviously disappointed that the issue was not taken up but it would have been unreasonable to expect a better result given the volatility of the stock market since the launch of the issue
but except for the embarrassment british <unk> will emerge relatively unscathed from the flopped issue
underwriters led by <unk> brothers <unk> will pick up the rest of the airline offer of four convertible capital bonds for every nine common shares
<unk> and other primary underwriters have reduced or eliminated their exposure by sub - underwriting the issue among <unk> institutional investors
the paper loss here is very small for these sub - underwriters observed <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> managing director
in any case he added n most institutions probably wo n't sell the bonds
and instead of buying the <unk> stake the <unk> carrier will be able to reduce its high debt level and build an acquisition war chest
from a cash flow point of view <unk> airways is better off not being in <unk> <unk> in the short term said <unk> chambers an analyst at <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>
added another <unk> analyst it gives them some cash in the back pocket for when they want to do something
for instance british <unk> is continuing to negotiate with <unk> <unk> <unk> airlines about each acquiring a <unk> stake in <unk> <unk> airlines the air transport subsidiary of the belgian national airline
a definitive agreement had been expected by the end of <unk>
the failed rights issue also should have a modest impact on british <unk> shares
the airline share price already is far below the <unk> pence n level seen after the company announced the rights issue in late <unk>
in late trading on <unk> <unk> <unk> yesterday the shares were off three pence at <unk> pence
and because british air is issuing convertible bonds rather than ordinary shares the share price wo n't be directly hurt by any surplus left with underwriters after they try to sell the issue in the open market
but british <unk> withdrawal from the <unk> buy - out could have further repercussions
some analysts speculated yesterday that the move has set off a board room split which may lead to the resignation of <unk> <unk> <unk> the carrier chief executive officer
the stories are rubbish a british <unk> spokesman said
there is no difference of opinion between <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on any aspect of company policy
minority recruiting has yet to meet hopes raised by <unk> administration
six months ago as some personnel specialists saw it a perception that <unk> <unk> really cared about fair employment after what they said <unk> was eight years of <unk> - era neglect was prodding top management to raise hiring goals for females blacks and other minorities

in an <unk> n editorial - page article it the <unk> <unk> turn to adjust <unk> <unk> <unk> lays most of the blame for what ails developing countries at the doorstep of the <unk> <unk>
the article is unfortunately replete with outrageous distortions
one of <unk> <unk> observations is that the <unk> own loan portfolio is in deep trouble because of its lending to developing countries
this is just not so
the reality is that <unk> finances are rock solid
as of <unk> <unk> <unk> the day n our past fiscal year came to a close only <unk> of the <unk> portfolio was affected by arrears of over six months
this is an enviably low level
moreover the <unk> follows a prudent provisioning policy and has set aside n million against possible loan losses
for the same fiscal year by the way the <unk> net income was a robust n billion after provisions
because of the business - like manner in which the <unk> goes about development financial markets have confidence in it
this helps explain the triple - a rating enjoyed by our bonds and our ability to borrow n billion in fiscal n on the most advantageous terms
another of <unk> <unk> criticisms is that <unk> lending has done more harm than good by implanting the wrong incentives and deflecting energy away from economic development
here too <unk> <unk> is way off the mark
the reality is that <unk> loans have been linked to policy improvements for n years
our traditional project loans have for instance supported sensible energy pricing in the power sector sound interest - rate policies in the credit area and the operation of public utilities as efficient autonomous agencies
by and large these efforts have borne fruit
in my home region <unk> <unk> much of the existing infrastructure base an important building block for development has been financed by the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> also takes a swipe at the <unk> adjustment lending
what are the facts on this type of lending
the <unk> has been making adjustment loans for n years
as their name implies these operations are linked to far - reaching policy reforms that aim at helping borrowing countries get back on the growth path and at enhancing their credit - worthiness
typically these measures include reforms n to downsize the role of government and parastatals in the economy to open up inward - looking economies to international competition and to promote the development of a vigorous private sector
support for the private sector has been a longstanding concern of the <unk>
over the years it has helped encourage investments by entrepreneurs in the <unk> <unk> through its extensive credit operations and through loans and investments by the <unk> <unk> <unk>
most recently the <unk> <unk> has been expanded to include the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to stimulate direct foreign investment in developing countries by offering guarantees against noncommercial risk and advice to member countries on how to improve their business climate
these are not the actions of a development agency wed to central planning and to the concentration of investment decisions in the hands of government as <unk> <unk> alleges
rather they reflect the <unk> time - tested pragmatic approach which aims at ensuring that developing countries put their scarce resources to the best possible use

the agency will withdraw from the production of nine food products maintaining production of the two most important ones corn and milk
<unk> <unk> also said n <unk> will cut back subsidies to producers of nonessential farm products and close retail outlets in wealthy neighborhoods
the agency workers and private companies would be allowed to bid for the assets up for sale
<unk> controls prices on agricultural goods and operates retail outlets where basic consumer items are sold at state - subsidized prices
business leaders have long criticized the agency as a leading example of bureacratic waste
private - sector leaders praised the <unk> restructuring
but most economists doubt n the streamlining would cut deeply into <unk> government subsidy which largely goes to reduce consumer prices for corn and milk
the <unk> and <unk> <unk> banned all imports of mushrooms from <unk> in response to a rash of food - poisoning outbreaks linked to canned chinese mushrooms
the agency has concluded that contamination may be widespread throughout the mushroom - processing industry in <unk> an <unk> spokesman said yesterday
the agency wo n't allow mushrooms that were canned or packed in brine at any chinese plant to enter the <unk> until satisfactory sanitation - control measures are implemented in <unk> to prevent bacterial contamination
on <unk> <unk> the <unk> began detaining chinese mushrooms in <unk> cans after more than n people in <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> became ill from eating tainted mushrooms
in subsequent tests the agency found smaller - size cans from several chinese plants to be similarly contaminated
the outbreaks were traced to staphylococcus aureus a type of bacteria that produces a toxin capable of surviving the high temperatures used in canning vegetables
a recall of the mushrooms blamed for the food poisoning began in early <unk>
in <unk> <unk> exported n million pounds of mushrooms valued at n million to the <unk>
the shipments went mostly to food - service distributors that supply pizzerias and restaurants
a spokesman for the chinese <unk> here said that the <unk> government has taken many effective measures to stop the mushroom contamination and is further investigating the underlying causes
he predicted n the problem will be solved very soon
your <unk> n <unk> <unk> article about <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> gives the impression that the <unk> has not been nor is actively involved
this is not the case
the <unk> is very supportive of and an active participant in <unk> <unk> initiative
it was agreed at the outset of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that the <unk> role would be to continue targeting the major drug traffickers through our <unk> <unk> <unk>
through these investigations we do not focus on the street drug user but rather we target and attack major drug - trafficking organizations that control a large segment of the drug market
the trial of <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> serves to highlight our efforts in this area and the results achieved through our excellent working relationship with the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the <unk> role is to complement the <unk> initiative through not only these major trafficking investigations but also by providing a full range of services through various task forces and our contacts with local police squads handling drug - related crimes
in fact we have agents assigned full time to assist the <unk> in drug - related crimes such as homicide and other crimes of violence

that unease is expected to grow today when the government reports on <unk> durable goods orders and again <unk> when the first assessment of third - quarter economic growth is released
analysts say n they think n durable goods orders fell about <unk> compared with a <unk> gain in <unk> and that growth in the third quarter slowed to about <unk> from the second quarter <unk>
the stock market decline coming after a record weekly gain of <unk> points surprised some investors
but <unk> <unk> director of research at <unk> <unk> said <unk> last week rally was a reflex reaction to the <unk> n stock market rout
overall he said n the trend in stock prices will be down as the economy weakens
we think n we on target in looking for renewed economic deterioration he said
corporate profits are going to decrease faster than interest rates will fall and the probability is that we see negative economic growth in the fourth quarter
<unk> <unk> chief investment officer at <unk> <unk> <unk> agreed that a deteriorating economy is worrisome but he said n the real concern among stock investors is that some new problem will crop up in the junk bond market
in major market activity <unk> prices slumped in sluggish trading
volume on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> totaled n million shares
declining issues on the <unk> <unk> were ahead of gainers <unk> to n
bond prices rallied
the yield on the <unk> benchmark <unk> bond slipped to <unk>
the dollar weakened against most other major currencies
in late <unk> <unk> trading the dollar was quoted at n marks and n yen compared with n marks and <unk> yen late <unk>
the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> consists of two separate door - to-door nationwide polls conducted for the <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> associates and the <unk> <unk>
the two surveys which asked different questions were conducted using national random probability samples
the poll conducted by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> interviewed <unk> adults age n and older from <unk> n to <unk> <unk> <unk>
the poll conducted by the <unk> <unk> interviewed <unk> adults age n and older from <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>
responses were weighted on the basis of age and gender to conform with <unk> <unk> data
for each poll the odds are n out of <unk> that if pollsters had sought to survey every household in the <unk> using the same questionnaire the findings would differ from these poll results by no more than <unk> <unk> percentage points in either direction
the margin of error for subgroups for example married women with children at home would be larger
in addition in any survey there is always the chance that other factors such as question wording could introduce errors into the findings

ironically <unk> <unk> attempt to lead industry prices higher was reported in the same issue as your survey showing that consumers had the least confidence in the airline industry <unk> n

even if <unk> <unk> is correct he of all people must realize <unk> our society relies on competition to keep prices at a competitive level
in <unk> he settled an antitrust suit based on a taped telephone conversation of him proposing to <unk> president that they both raise fares n
<unk> declined
when i asked <unk> airlines for its side of the story for use in my <unk> class where i teach business ethics it did not respond
perhaps the ethics of an industry leader filters down and is one of the factors that ultimately shapes consumer trust in that industry

<unk> <unk> is launching a new service n to offer advertisers package deals combining its book magazine and videocassette products
the <unk> <unk> - based publisher said <unk> it created a new <unk> <unk> <unk> that will offer advertisers special rates for combination packages in its magazines such as <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> homes and gardens
in addition the group will create custom - designed media such as cookbooks newspaper inserts and videos for ad campaigns
earlier this year <unk> sold its first such package for n million to <unk> <unk> now a unit of <unk> <unk> - based <unk> <unk> <unk>
the <unk> package included a specially published cookbook a national free - standing insert in <unk> newspapers and a <unk> advertorial section that ran in five <unk> magazines
<unk> recently agreed to spend an additional n million on similar programs through n
<unk> <unk> director of the new marketing unit said <unk> <unk> is negotiating other large - scale packages with leading companies in several product categories but he would n't disclose their names
sources close to the company and ad agencies that work with <unk> said n leading advertisers in consumer electronics packaged goods and automotive products were among those negotiating ad packages with the <unk> group
other magazine publishing companies have been moving in the same direction
the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> earlier this year began offering advertisers extensive merchandising services built around buying ad pages in its <unk> <unk> magazine
<unk> <unk> <unk> recently formed a synergy department n to seek out ways n to offer advertisers packages that could combine <unk> magazines with <unk> products such as videocassettes
<unk> <unk> director of media services at <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> is the leader in providing multimedia packages
they may get passed up later when other publishers get their acts together but for now they are the quickest offering the most extensive plan he said
<unk> <unk> of <unk> said n one advertiser which he would n't identify wants <unk> to provide ad pages in seven <unk> magazines publish an interior - decorating book that will be distributed at point of purchase give away a videotape on installation pointers and possibly use <unk> <unk> homes and gardens residential real - estate agents to distribute discount - coupon books to new homeowners
five years ago magazine publishers would simply bid on an advertiser big ad schedule for their magazine said <unk> <unk>
but the marketplace changed
advertisers now say help us improve our image and extend our selling season
they are coming to publishers looking for ideas
your <unk> n article it so <unk> to get burned when buying a small firm was excellent
i been advising small businesses many years and have lived with the fact that <unk> will go out of business within two years and n in five years
the economic loss jobs lost anguish frustration and humiliation are beyond measure
and most of these are absolutely unnecessary
your article points out the traps n people fall into but when reviewing those traps one sees <unk> just about all of them could have been avoided
an accountant did not review the seller books before buying a business

a few months ago your paper reported the results of a study to determine why asians who arrive in this country without any money and unable to speak <unk> become overnight successes
their secret is that they gather a small group of advisers around them listen to what they have to say prepare a business plan and they are on their way
successful american business owners do the same thing
unfortunately they are in the minority
avoiding failure is easy
it unfortunate <unk> so many must learn the hard way
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the management turnover at <unk> <unk> <unk> continued with the resignation of company president <unk> <unk> <unk> who joined <unk> just two years ago
<unk> <unk> departure follows by two months the resignation of <unk> <unk> as senior vice president and chief marketing officer after only n months at <unk>
the resignations by the two executives considered hard - charging and abrasive by <unk> insiders reflect a difference in style with <unk> <unk> chairman and chief executive according to several former executives
the two executives are among a number of outsiders recruited by <unk> in the past few years to help it make the transition from a small start - up company to a marketing giant with sales last year of n billion
the changes come as <unk> which grew rapidly in the n but has seen its sales flatten of late is seeking to regain momentum in the athletic - shoe business against rivals <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
the departures said <unk> <unk> <unk> an analyst at <unk> securities in <unk> <unk> should enable the company to focus on business issues instead of management differences
i think n it more an issue of style
i would view it as a net positive
the company can go about its business
they in the midst of a turnaround she noted
earnings have rebounded in <unk> after a n decline last year
a former executive agreed that the departures do n't reflect major problems adding if you see any company that grows as fast as <unk> did it is going to have people coming and going
<unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> will resume the presidency of <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> - based venture capital firm that he founded in <unk>
before that he was president and chief operating officer of <unk> <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> added that <unk> <unk> will assume the title of president
a spokesman said that neither <unk> <unk> nor <unk> <unk> would be available for comment
we will not be commenting beyond the news release the spokesman said
<unk> <unk> who had been president of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> division before joining <unk> in <unk> n left in <unk> to pursue other interests
magazine publishers are facing spiraling costs and a glut of new titles
but even a raft of recent failures is n't stopping them from launching new publications
at the <unk> <unk> <unk> here publishers are plenty worried about the industry woes
but they are also talking about new magazines
for example <unk> - based <unk> <unk> will publish <unk> <unk> a new food and health magazine due out next summer
<unk> <unk> - based <unk> <unk> this fall plans to publish its first issue of <unk> <unk> a magazine for expectant mothers and has already launched <unk> <unk>
and <unk> <unk> <unk> is developing a spinoff of <unk> magazine aimed at kids on the heels of its successful <unk> <unk> for kids
over the past four years the number of consumer magazines has increased by an average of <unk> magazines annually according to <unk> <unk> president of the <unk> publishers of <unk>
this is an impressive show of faith in the future of the magazine industry said <unk> <unk>
entrepreneurs do n't rush to get into a stagnant or declining industry
and despite the recent tough advertising climate industry figures released at the meeting here indicate n things may be turning around
for the first nine months advertising pages in consumer magazines tracked by the publishers <unk> <unk> increased <unk> from the same period last year to <unk> pages
total magazine ad revenue for the same period increased <unk> to n billion
<unk> for some magazines categories a tough advertising climate persists the industry in general is doing well compared with the newspaper industry
though some magazines are thriving the magazine publishing industry remains a risky business
within the same nine months <unk> <unk> closed down in <unk> a once - promising young woman fashion magazine <unk> <unk> <unk> has folded the long - troubled <unk> magazine and <unk> <unk> has announced <unk> <unk> magazine after n years will no longer carry advertising as of <unk>
<unk> is cutting costs and will attempt to operate the magazine with only subscription revenue
meanwhile <unk> <unk> partners publisher of <unk> <unk> magazine is deep in debt and <unk> <unk> founder and managing partner is being forced to sell the magazine to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> absence from the meeting here raised speculation that the sale is in trouble
<unk> <unk> said in a telephone interview from <unk> <unk> that the sale was proceeding as planned
the magazine is strong
it simply the right time n to do what we are doing <unk> <unk> said
magazines can no longer be considered institutions said <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> magazine group
publishers will find that some magazines have served their purpose and should die he added
magazines could like other brands find that they have only a limited life
there are also indications that the number of magazine entrepreneurs traditionally depended upon to break new ground with potentially risky start - ups are dwindling
more than ever independent magazines and small publishing groups are being gobbled up by larger publishing groups such as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a unit of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a unit of <unk> <unk> <unk> which are consolidating in order to gain leverage with advertisers
some entrepreneurs are still active though
<unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> - based <unk> <unk> <unk> earlier this year sold his <unk> <unk> <unk> magazine to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> said that in the next six months he will take n million from the <unk> <unk> <unk> sale to acquire new magazines
he would not reveal which magazines he is considering
the magazines n i am looking for are underdeveloped said <unk> <unk>
they could be old or new but they are magazines whose editorial quality needs to be improved

the crisis had peaked on <unk> <unk> <unk> when the bank disclosed severe foreign - exchange losses due to unauthorized trading
massive withdrawals followed and there was a brief rescue attempt with political undertones including <unk> billion in <unk> <unk> loans

he heads <unk> sciences <unk> the nation largest legal consulting firm which is helping corporate <unk> prepare for high - stakes litigation by predicting and shaping jurors reactions
in the process <unk> sciences is quietly but inexorably reshaping the world of law
little known outside the legal world but a powerhouse within <unk> sciences a unit of <unk> <unk> <unk> employs more than n psychologists sociologists marketers graphic artists and technicians
twenty - one of its workers are <unk> . <unk>
among other services the firm provides pre - trial opinion polls creates profiles of ideal jurors sets up mock trials and shadow juries coaches lawyers and witnesses and designs courtroom graphics
much like their cohorts in political consulting and product marketing the litigation advisers encourage their clients to play down complex or ambiguous matters simplify their messages and provide their target audiences with a psychological craving n to make the desired choice
with jury verdicts getting bigger all the time companies are increasingly willing to pay huge sums for such advice
recently <unk> sciences helped <unk> <unk> win a n billion jury verdict against <unk> <unk>
it advised the <unk> <unk> <unk> in its largely successful defense of antitrust charges by the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
and it helped win defense verdicts in product - liability suits involving scores of products ranging from <unk> <unk> tires to the anti - nausea drug <unk>
largely as a result <unk> sciences has more than doubled in size in the past two years
its n revenue was n million
meanwhile competitors are being spawned almost daily some n new businesses many just one - person shops have sprung up
<unk> <unk> estimates n the industry total revenues approach n million
in any high - stakes case you can be sure that one side or the other or even both is using litigation consultants
despite their ubiquity the consultants are n't entirely welcome
some lawyers and scholars see the social scientists vision of the american jury system as a far cry from the ideal presented in civics texts and memorialized on the movie screen
in the film classic <unk> <unk> men the crucible of deliberations unmasks each juror bias and purges it from playing a role in the verdict
after hours of conflict and debate that jury focuses on the facts with near - perfect objectivity
in real life jurors may not always work that way but some court observers question why they should n't be encouraged to do so rather than be programmed not to
litigation consulting is as <unk> <unk> trial attorney <unk> <unk> puts it highly manipulative
he adds the notion n they try to sell is that juries do n't make decisions rationally
but the effort is also being made to try and cause jurors not to decide things rationally
i find it troubling
but <unk> <unk> also acknowledges that consultants can be very effective
it gotten to the point where if the case is large enough it almost malpractice not to use them he says
others complain that the consultants growing influence exacerbates the advantage of litigants wealthy enough to afford such pricey services
the affluent people and the corporations can buy it the poor radicals in political cases get it free and everybody in between is at a disadvantage and that not the kind of system n we want says <unk> <unk> a prominent sociologist who teaches at <unk> <unk> <unk>
sophisticated trial consulting grew ironically from the radical political movements of the <unk> and n before finding its more lucrative calling in big commercial cases
the <unk> <unk> trial in <unk> in which <unk> <unk> and others were charged with plotting anti - war-related violence was a landmark
in that case a group of left - leaning sociologists interviewed n registered voters around <unk>
the researchers discovered that episcopalians <unk> methodists and fundamantalist protestants were nearly always against the defendants the lawyers resolved to try to keep them off the jury
the defense also learned that college - educated people were uncharacteristically conservative about the <unk> <unk>
a more blue - collar panel became a second aim
ultimately that carefully picked jury deadlocked with a <unk> vote n to acquit and the prosecution decided not to retry the case
litigation consulting had arrived
the fledgling science went corporate in <unk> when <unk> <unk> machines <unk> hired a marketing professor n to help defend a complex antitrust case
the problem for <unk> trial lawyers <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> was how to make such a highly technical case understandable
as the trial progressed they were eager to know if the jury was keeping up with them
the solution devised by the professor was to hire six people who would mirror the actual jury demographically sit in on the trial and report their reactions to him
he then briefed <unk> <unk> and <unk> who had the chance to tilt their next day presentation accordingly
thus the shadow jury was born
<unk> <unk> the professor got the law bug and formed <unk> sciences
<unk> won the case
the hardest thing in any complex case is to retain objectivity and in some sense your ignorance says <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>
what you look for in a shadow jury is very much what you do when you give an opening argument to your wife or a friend and get some response to it
a shadow jury is a way n to do that in a more systematic and organized way
the approach worked well in the recent antitrust case in which <unk> <unk> systems <unk> sued <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> over the transport of semi - liquefied coal the kind of case likely to make almost anyone eyes glaze over
<unk> <unk> retained <unk> sciences at a cost of several hundred thousand dollars n to poll pre - try profile and shadow
just before the actual closing arguments the firm put the case to a vote of the five shadow jurors each of whom was being paid <unk> a day
the jurors who did n't know which side had retained them decided for <unk> <unk> and awarded n million in damages
the real jury returned days later with a n million victory for <unk> <unk>
it just like weather forecasting says <unk> <unk> trial attorney <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
it often wrong but it better than consulting an indian rain dancer
forecasting is only one part of <unk> sciences work
changing the outcome of the trial is what really matters
and to the uninitiated some of the firm approaches may seem chillingly manipulative
theoretically jurors are supposed to weigh the evidence in a case logically and objectively
instead <unk> <unk> says <unk> interviews with thousands of jurors reveal that they start with firmly entrenched attitudes and try to shoe - horn the facts of the case n to fit their views
<unk> - trial polling helps the consultants develop a profile of the right type of juror
if it is a case in which the client seeks punitive damages for example depressed underemployed people are far more likely to grant them
someone with a master degree in classical arts who works in a deli would be ideal <unk> sciences advises <unk>
so would someone recently divorced or widowed
since <unk> sciences generally represents the defense its job is usually to help the lawyers identify and remove such people from the jury
for personal - injury cases <unk> sciences seeks defense jurors who believe that most people including victims get what they deserve
such people also typically hold negative attitudes toward the physically handicapped the poor blacks and women
the consultants help the defense lawyers find such jurors by asking questions about potential jurors attitudes toward volunteer work or toward particular movies or books
<unk> sciences does n't make moral distinctions
if a client needs prejudiced jurors the firm will help find them
as <unk> <unk> explains it we do n't control the facts
they are what they are
but any lawyer will select the facts and the strategy <unk> to employ
in our system of advocacy the trial lawyer is duty bound to present the best case n he possibly can
once a jury is selected the consultants often continue to determine what the jurors attitudes are likely to be and help shape the lawyers presentation accordingly
<unk> plays a minimal role here
more important are what <unk> calls psychological anchors a few focal points calculated to appeal to the jury on a gut level
in one personal - injury case a woman claimed <unk> she had been injured when she slipped in a pool but the fall did n't explain why one of her arms was discolored bluish
by repeatedly drawing the jury attention to the arm the defense lawyers planted doubt about the origin of the woman injuries
the ploy worked
the defense won
in a classic defense of a personal - injury case the consultants concentrate on encouraging the jury to shift the blame
the ideal defense in a case involving an accident is to persuade the jurors to hold the accident victim responsible for his or her plight <unk> <unk> has written
slick graphics pre - tested for effectiveness also play a major role in <unk> sciences operation
studies show the consultants say <unk> that people absorb information better and remember it longer if they receive it visually
computer - generated videos help
the average <unk> watches seven hours of tv a day
they are very visually sophisticated explains <unk> graphics specialist <unk> <unk>
lawyers remain divided about whether anything is wrong with all this
supporters acknowledge that the process aims to manipulate but they insist that the best trial lawyers have always employed similar tactics
they may not have been able to articulate it all but they did it says <unk> <unk> a legal ethics expert at <unk> <unk> <unk> law school
what you have here is intuition made manifest
many lawyers maintain that all fair in the adversary system as long as no one tampers with the evidence
others point out that lawyers in small communities have always had a feel for public sentiment and used that to advantage
litigation consulting is n't a guarantee of a favorable outcome
<unk> sciences concedes that in one in n cases it was flatout wrong in its predictions
a few attorneys offer horror stories of jobs botched by consultants or of overpriced services as when one lawyer paid a consultant not at <unk> sciences <unk> to interview a jury after a big trial and later read more informative interviews with the same jurors in the <unk> <unk> magazine
some litigators scoff at the notion that a sociologist knows more than they do about what makes a jury tick
the essence of being a trial lawyer is understanding how people of diverse backgrounds react to you and your presentation says <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> who recently won a huge case on behalf of insurers against <unk> <unk> <unk>
he says n he used consultants in the case but found them to be virtually useless
but most lawyers accept that the marketplace has spoken
and the question remains whether the jury system can maintain its integrity while undergoing such a skillful massage
for more than a decade <unk> <unk> the sociologist has been a leading critic of the masseurs
there no reason n to believe that juries rule inappropriately he says
but the last thing n you want to do is manipulate the subconscious to make them think better
what you then do is <unk> you make them think inappropriately
to hamper the work of litigation scientists he suggests that courts sharply limit the number of jurors that lawyers can remove from the jury panel through so - called peremptory challenges exclusions that do n't require explanations
in most civil cases judges allow each side three such challenges
for complex cases judges sometimes allow many more
<unk> <unk> also suggests forbidding anyone from gathering background information about the jurors
some courts release names and addresses and researchers can drive by houses look up credit ratings and even question neighbors
furthermore he says n psychologists should not be allowed to analyze jurors personalities
even some lawyers who have used consultants to their advantage see a need to limit their impact
<unk> <unk> the first lawyer <unk> to use <unk> <unk> services cautions against courts allowing extensive jury questioning known as voir dire or giving out personal information about the jurors
the more extensive the voir dire the easier you make it for that kind of research to be effective and i do n't think <unk> courts should lend themselves to that <unk> <unk> says
<unk> <unk> <unk> a fast - growing maker of computer workstations said <unk> it landed two federal government contracts worth more than n million over the next five years
one award is part of a <unk> of <unk> contract to <unk> <unk> <unk> - <unk> computers and could be valued at more than n million over five years
the other involves the sale of about <unk> of the company high - end workstations to the <unk> institutes of <unk>
the models which cost about <unk> each will be used in research
the awards are evidence that <unk> <unk> approach to computer graphics is catching on with users of powerful desktop computers analysts said n
the company on a roll said <unk> <unk> an analyst at <unk> <unk>
no other computer vendor offers graphics performance that good for their price
in the battle <unk> to supply desktop computers for researchers and design engineers most of the attention is given to the biggest competitors <unk> microsystems <unk> <unk> - <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> which make computers mainly aimed at a wide range of engineering and scientific needs
<unk> <unk> on the other hand has targeted a specific niche since its inception in <unk> which has been dubbed by some as motion - picture computing
this is a style of visual computing that provides three - dimensional color models of everything from the inside of a house to the latest in women fashion
<unk> <unk> <unk> is much smaller than <unk> <unk> and <unk> it has emerged in recent years as a feared adversary in this graphics portion of the workstation market
in addition the company has made it tough on competitors by offering a stream of desktop computers at sharply lower prices
a year ago <unk> <unk> introduced a model priced at <unk> almost as cheap as mainstream workstations that do n't offer special graphics features
<unk> <unk> also plans to unveil even less expensive machines in the near future
it pretty safe to assume n we can bring the cost down of these systems by <unk> to <unk> a year said <unk> <unk> the company chief executive officer
<unk> <unk> strategy seems to be paying off
revenue for its first quarter ended <unk> <unk> was n million a <unk> increase over the year - ago period
profit was n million compared with n million for the year - ago quarter
remember those bulky thick - walled refrigerators of n years ago
they or at least something less efficient than today thin - walled units may soon be making a comeback
that something whatever it is could add as much as <unk> to the n or so n consumers now pay for lower - priced refrigerators
these and other expensive changes in products ranging from auto air conditioners to foam cushioning to commercial solvents are in prospect because of something called the <unk> <unk> signed by <unk> nations in <unk>
in one of the most sweeping environmental regulatory efforts to date involving products with an annual value of n billion in the <unk> alone the signatories agreed to curtail sharply the use of chlorofluorocarbons <unk>
world - wide production would be cut in half by n
the <unk> <unk> liked the treaty so well n it ratified it by a vote of <unk> to n
not to be outdone <unk> <unk> wants <unk> banished altogether by the year <unk> a goal endorsed at an n <unk> environmental meeting in <unk> in the spring
that a lot of banishment as it turns out
cfcs are the primary ingredient in a gas often referred to by the <unk> <unk> trade name freon which is compressed to liquid form to serve as the cooling agent in refrigeration and air - conditioning equipment
gases containing <unk> are pumped into polyurethane to make the foam used in pillows upholstery and insulation
polyurethane foam is a highly efficient insulator which accounts for why the walls of refrigerators and freezers can be thinner now than they were back in the days when they were insulated with glass fiber
but even though by some estimates it might cost the world as much as n billion between now and the year n to convert to other coolants foaming agents and solvents and to redesign equipment for these less efficient substitutes the <unk> <unk> legions of supporters say n it is worth it
they insist that cfcs are damaging the earth stratospheric ozone layer which screens out some of the sun ultraviolet rays
hence as they see it if something is n't done earthlings will become ever more subject to sunburn and skin cancer
<unk> <unk> a specialist in heat transfer is running a project at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> n to find alternative technologies that will allow industry to eliminate cfcs
in addition to his interest in ozone depletion he has extensively studied the related topic of global warming a theory that mankind generation of carbon dioxide through increased combustion of fossil fuels is creating a greenhouse effect that will work important climatic changes in the earth atmosphere over time
i would be the first n to admit that there is not a complete consensus in the scientific community on either one of these problems says <unk> <unk>
in the kind of literature n i read i come across countervailing opinions quite frequently
but the nature of the problem is such that many others feel n it has to be addressed soon before all the evidence is in
we ca n't afford to wait
but does it have to be so soon
some atmospheric scientists think that even if cfcs were released into the atmosphere at an accelerating rate the amount of ozone depletion would be only n by the middle of the next century
it easy to get something comparable by simply moving to a higher altitude in the <unk>
moreover there are questions particularly among atmospheric scientists who know this subject best about the ability of anyone to know what in fact is happening to the ozone layer
it is generally agreed that when <unk> rise from earth to stratosphere the chlorine in them is capable of interfering with the process through which ultraviolet rays split oxygen molecules and form ozone
but ozone creation is a very large - scale natural process and the importance of human - generated <unk> in reducing it is largely a matter of conjecture
the ozone layer is constantly in motion and thus very hard to measure
what scientists have known since the late <unk> is that there is a hole in the layer over <unk> that expands or contracts from year to year
but it is at least worthy of some note that there are very few refrigerators in <unk>
moreover surely someone has noticed that household refrigerators are closed systems running for many years without either the <unk> gas or the insulation ever escaping
another argument of the environmentalists is that if substitutes are available why not use them
<unk> <unk> cites a list of substitutes but none so far match the nonflammable nontoxic <unk>
butane and propane can be used as coolants for example but are flammable
moreover new lubricants will be needed to protect compressors from the new formulations which as with cfcs are solvents
<unk> <unk> points out as well that if the equipment designed to get along without <unk> is less efficient than current devices energy consumption will rise and that will worsen the greenhouse effect
folks in the <unk> who just suffered a mid - <unk> snowstorm may wonder where the greenhouse was when they needed it but let not be flippant about grave risks
as it happens <unk> <unk> <unk> is not at all interested in throwing cold water on ozone depletion and global warming theories
it is interested in making some money advising industry on how to convert to a world without <unk>
there is after all big money in environmentalism
maybe we should ask why it was that <unk> <unk> so quickly capitulated and issued a statement giving it wide publicity that it was withdrawing <unk>
<unk> introduced in <unk> revolutionized <unk> by making refrigeration and air conditioning practical after all
one answer is that big companies are growing weary of fighting environmental movements and are trying instead to cash in on them although they never care to put it quite that way
<unk> <unk> as it happens has a potential substitute for cfcs
<unk> <unk> industries of the <unk> also has one and is building a plant in <unk> <unk> to produce it
japanese chemical companies are at work developing their own substitutes and hoping to conquer new markets of course
there are still others who do n't mind seeing new crises arise
environmental groups would soon go out of business were they not able to send out mailings describing the latest threat and asking for money n to fight it
university professors and consultants with scientific credentials saw a huge market for their services evaporate when price decontrol destroyed the energy crisis and thus the demand for alternative energy
they needed new crises to generate new grants and contracts
in other words environmentalism has created a whole set of vested interests that fare better when there are many problems than when there are few
that tends to tilt the public debate toward solutions even when some of the most knowledgeable scientists are skeptical about the seriousness of the threats and the insistence of urgency
there is an element of make - work involved
consumers pay the bill for all this in the price of a refrigerator or an air - conditioned car

with most legislatures adjourned for the year small business is tallying its scorecard
much of its attention was spent fighting organized labor initiatives on issues n the small - business community traditionally opposes from raising state minimum wage levels to mandating benefits in health plans
while results were mixed in many states small business got by fairly well concludes <unk> <unk> <unk> associate director of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> the largest small - business organization
five states <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> passed bills n to boost the minimum wage but measures in <unk> other states were defeated
<unk> rate will rise to n an hour the nation highest in <unk> n <unk>
<unk> will be the second highest at n an hour in <unk> n but small - business lobbyists won an exclusion for tiny concerns and a lower training rate
in n central states one small - business count shows <unk> lawmakers adopted only three of n bills mandating health coverage or parental leave
the <unk> <unk> narrowly passed a parental - leave bill which <unk> <unk> <unk> vetoed and <unk> and <unk> amended laws <unk> to require that employers pay for breast - cancer exams
small business is bracing for an avalanche of similar proposals next year
those kinds of issues always keep coming back says <unk> <unk> who manages the <unk> <unk> of <unk> small - business office
despite victories this year small business fears losing parental - leave war
only two states <unk> and <unk> this year joined five others requiring private employers to grant leaves of absence to employees with newborn or adopted infants
similar proposals were defeated in at least n other states
but small business which generally detests government - mandated benefits has taken note of the growing number of close votes
it just a matter of time before the tide turns says one midwestern lobbyist
consequently small business is taking more pro - active steps n to counter mandated leaves
in <unk> small businesses are pushing for a voluntary alternative they favor a commission that would develop sample leave policies that employers could adopt
they also support a tax credit for employers <unk> to offset the cost of hiring and training workers who temporarily replace employees on parental leave
in <unk> the issue is expected to be especially close in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
we be playing a lot of defense especially in the <unk> and <unk> says <unk> <unk> of the <unk>
in <unk> <unk> more small businesses ponder adopting a child - care policy
triggering the re - examination is a recent city council decision to give preference in letting city contracts to suppliers with a stated policy on child care for their employees
the preferential treatment even applies to awarding small contracts under <unk> and consulting and temporary services which often go to the smaller concerns
firms are permitted wide flexibility in the child - care arrangements n they provide
council member <unk> <unk> the measure chief advocate considers it part of a pro - family policy that makes <unk> <unk> a leader in humanizing the workplace
<unk> ballots will contain few referendum or initiative issues that especially affect small business
in <unk> <unk> small businesses are urging passage of a local initiative n to build a new n million downtown baseball stadium they believe n it will spur retail sales and hotel - restaurant business
but in <unk> state small business generally opposes an initiative n to boost spending on children programs by n million fearing <unk> the state n sales tax will be raised to finance the outlays

<unk> a trend - setter in franchising rules stirs a controversy
with some new rules state officials say n they made it easier and faster to sell new franchises whose terms stray from those in state - registered contracts
previously regulators insisted that franchisers pre - register such changes with the state a costly process taking at least six weeks
now some negotiated sales that meet a series of tests do n't have to be pre - registered
for instance franchisers no longer must pre - register sales to aspiring franchisees who qualify as sophisticated purchasers
such buyers must have a minimum net worth of n million n annual income or recent experience in the business area of the franchise being sold
but critics consider the changes regressive
<unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> lawyer who represents franchisers contends <unk> <unk> is narrowly limiting rather than expanding opportunities for negotiating sales
he argues <unk> <unk> regulators historically have misinterpreted their law and he says n negotiated sales that are n't pre - registered have been legal all along
<unk> <unk> lawyer <unk> <unk> <unk> who represents franchisees insists <unk> <unk> cautiousness helps protect franchisees from crafty sales negotiators who push unlawful clauses

about n commuters trying to find their way through the <unk> area quake - torn transportation system wedged cheek - to-jowl into subways sat in traffic jams on major freeways or waited forlornly for buses yesterday
in other words it was a better - than-average <unk> commute
city officials feared widespread gridlock on the first day that normal business operations were resumed following last <unk> earthquake
the massive temblor which killed at least n people severed the <unk> <unk> a major artery to the east and closed most ramps leading to and from <unk> <unk> the biggest artery to the south
it will take several weeks to repair the bridge and several months to repair some of the <unk> connections
but in spite of a wind - driven rainstorm gridlock never materialized mainly because the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> subway system carried n more passengers than normal
for the first time in memory it was standing - room only in <unk> sleek modern railcars
moreover the two main bridges still connecting <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> did n't charge tolls allowing traffic to zip through without stopping
officials also suspect that traffic benefited from steps by major employers <unk> to get workers to come in at odd hours or that many workers are still staying at home
many commuters who normally drove across the <unk> <unk> which is shut down for several weeks because of damage to one span actually may have reached work a bit faster on <unk> yesterday provided n they could find a parking space at the system jammed stations
in the best of times the <unk> <unk> is the worst commute in the region often experiencing back - ups of <unk> to <unk> minutes or more
not that getting into town was easy
storm flooding caused back - ups on the freeway and many commuters had to find rides to <unk> stations because parking lots were full before dawn
bus schedules were sometimes in disarray stranding commuters such as <unk> <unk>
her commute from <unk> <unk> normally takes an hour and <unk> minutes via the <unk> <unk> <unk> which connects <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> area
yesterday she was still waiting at a bus stop after three hours trying to transfer to a bus going to the financial district
it worse than i thought she said
i do n't know where all the buses are
but while traffic was heavy early in the commute over the <unk> <unk> by n a.m. it already had thinned out
it one of the smoothest commutes n i ever had said <unk> <unk> an insurance broker on the bus from <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
it looks like a holiday
i think n a lot of people got scared and stayed home
however a spokeswoman for <unk> <unk> said <unk> yesterday absenteeism at the bank holding company was no greater than on an average day
at the <unk> <unk> <unk> which connects the <unk> <unk> peninsula with the <unk> <unk> police were surprised at the speed with which traffic moved
everybody pretty much pitched in and cooperated said <unk> <unk> a sergeant with the <unk> <unk> <unk>
there were many indications that the new work hours implemented by major corporations played a big role
the <unk> <unk> handled as many cars as normally yesterday but over four hours rather than the usual two - hour crush
<unk> <unk> <unk> the giant closely held engineering concern says n it has instituted a n a.m. to <unk> <unk> flextime arrangement whereby employees may select any eight - hour period during those hours n to go to work
of <unk> <unk> employees about n work in <unk> <unk> one - third of them commuting from stricken <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is offering its <unk> <unk> <unk> employees a two - tier flextime schedule either n a.m. to <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> to <unk> p.m
the flextime may cut by almost a third the number of <unk> employees working conventional <unk> hours a spokesman says n
some of the utility employees may opt for a four - day workweek n hours a day to cut the commute by <unk>
at <unk> <unk> <unk> flextime is left up to individual working groups because some of the telephone company employees must be on - site during normal business hours a spokeswoman says n
some individuals went to some lengths on their own to avoid the anticipated gridlock
one senior vice president at <unk> said n he got up at <unk> a.m. to drive into <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk>
but transportation officials worry that such extraordinary measures and cooperation may not last
although one transportation official said <unk> drivers who did n't use car pools were committing an anti - social act about two - thirds of the motorists crossing the <unk> <unk> were alone compared with the normal n rate
and some commuters relieved by the absence of gridlock were planning to return to their old ways
<unk> <unk> went to combat <unk> with the world most advanced chess computer and kicked it around symbolically anyway like an old tin can
playing black in the first game the human champion maneuvered <unk> <unk> known for its attacking prowess into a totally passive position
then he unleashed his own unstoppable attack
and in the second game with <unk> <unk> advancing ferociously as white <unk> offered feeble resistance and lost even faster
well mankind can rest easier for now
though almost everybody at the playing site had been looking for the <unk> <unk> to beat the <unk> - based computer he gave the machine a far worse drubbing than many expected
and when <unk> <unk> strode into the playing hall he called the outcome
as if he were <unk> <unk> about to enter the ring with a n weakling he declared i be able to beat any computer for the next five years
his strategy against <unk> was based on a thorough study of dozens of its games he said n including its notorious whippings of the grandmasters <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> of the <unk>
<unk> <unk> was underwhelmed
the computer mind is too straight too primitive lacking the intuition and creativity needed to reach the top he said n
the champion apparently was not worried at all about <unk> strong points
its chief builder <unk> - born <unk> - <unk> <unk> nicknamed his brainchild the <unk> for its tactical flair at wriggling out of horrible positions
<unk> also has a prodigious and flawless memory is utterly fearless and could n't be distracted by the sexy nude sculptures spread around the playing hall in the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>
in fact <unk> never left home <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> but communicated with its human handlers by telephone link
they conceded that the odds favored <unk> <unk> but they put their hope in <unk> recently enhanced capacity for examining positions up to a million per second from <unk>
but the handlers mistakenly stuck with silicon chips they needed kryptonite
this became apparent as game one a <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> proceeded
no human can examine millions of moves but <unk> <unk> using his ineffably powerful brain consistently found very good ones
after eight moves by each side the board was the same as in a game in which <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> fought the champion to a draw in <unk>
but the computer did n't play <unk> <unk> ninth move a key pawn thrust and its position deteriorated rapidly
instead of castling a standard measure n to safeguard the king <unk> made a second - rate rook maneuver at move <unk> then it put a knight offside on move n
only two classes of minds would think of this very weak human players and computers said <unk> <unk> the expert commentator for the match which was attended by hundreds of chess fans
by move <unk> <unk> had fallen into a deep positional trap
it allowed <unk> <unk> to exchange his dark - squared bishop for one of <unk> knights
bishops usually are worth slightly more than knights but in this case <unk> <unk> was left with a very dangerous knight and <unk> surviving bishop was reduced to passivity
indeed it looked more like a pawn a tall pawn as spectators snidely put it
consistently <unk> was over - optimistic about its chances which it continually sized up in numerical form
when most spectators thought its position hopeless the computer thought n it was only in effect one - half of a pawn down
such evaluations met with derision and kept the machine from resigning as soon as humans would have prompting more derision
while <unk> shuffled its king back and forth in a defensive crouch <unk> <unk> maneuvered the knight to a dominant outpost
he also launched a kingside storm sacrificing a pawn to denude <unk> king
no amount of weasling could have saved this game for <unk>
a piece down the computer resigned
now with the crowd in the analysis room smelling figurative blood the only question seemed to be how fast <unk> <unk> could win game two
with the advantage of playing white which moves first <unk> <unk> followed up cleverly against the computer defense a <unk> <unk> <unk>
as early as move six <unk> <unk> deviated from a well - known sequence of moves developing a knight instead of making a standard bishop attack against the computer advanced knight
this left the computer with a broader range of plausible replies and it immediately blundered by moving a queenside pawn to the neglect of kingside development
in a new position just after the opening a computer will have serious problems <unk> <unk> said later
in such positions he explained n you have to create something new and the computer is n't able to do that right now
after only n moves for each side the computer position was shaky
greedily it grabbed a pawn at the cost of facing a brutal attack
and when a defensive move was called for <unk> passed up an obvious pawn move and instead exposed its queen to immediate tactical threats
<unk> <unk> remarked later that even a weak club player would have avoided the queen move
now after only a dozen moves spectators were looking for a mating combination
on a demonstration board emcee <unk> <unk> showed a quick kill initiated by a knight sacrifice no spectator refuted this line of play
<unk> <unk> continuation was slower but in the end just as deadly
he won <unk> queen for two minor pieces and two pawns not enough compensation in this position n to give the computer much hope
in a hopeless position the computer resigned rather than make its n move
and <unk> <unk> to cheers and applause marched back into the analysis room
in both games i got exactly what i wanted he said
what he had demonstrated he added <unk> is that there more to chess than sheer calculation
undeterred <unk> handlers vowed to press on
indeed three of them will be building a successor machine for <unk> <unk> machines <unk>
promises <unk> - <unk> <unk> in three years we mount a better challenge
<unk> <unk> is a reporter in the <unk> <unk> <unk> bureau
reaching for that extra bit of yield can be a big mistake especially if you do n't understand what you investing in
just ask <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> dentist who considers himself a reasonably sophisticated investor
in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> gave <unk> <unk> <unk> about <unk> for a federally insured certificate of deposit offering an effective yield of more than <unk>
it was a time when interest rates came down very rapidly <unk> <unk> recalls
yields on five - year cds at major banks were averaging about <unk> and <unk> <unk> notes were paying less than n
the <unk> seemed like a great deal
but nearly <unk> n years later <unk> says n the investment is worth about <unk> an amount that represents an annual return of just over <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk>
the problem is that the <unk> n he bought for a retirement plan was n't a plain vanilla cd
instead his <unk> broker put him in a zero - coupon cd which is sold at a deep discount to its face value
the difference between the price and the face value payable at maturity is the investor return
more important the cd was purchased on the secondary or resale market
because the <unk> had an effective yield of <unk> when it was issued in <unk> and interest rates in general had declined sharply since then part of the price <unk> <unk> <unk> paid was a premium an additional amount on top of the <unk> base value plus accrued interest that represented the <unk> increased market value
now the thrift that issued the <unk> is insolvent and <unk> <unk> has learned to his surprise that the premium is n't insured under federal deposit insurance
the tip - off came when he opened a recent <unk> <unk> statement and found that the <unk> estimated current market value had plummeted by <unk> in a month
several phone calls and a visit to his broker office later the dentist found out that the <unk> drop represented the current value of the premium n he paid when he bought the <unk> and that the amount was n't insured
this is one thing n i was never aware of he says
he assumed that principal and interest were fully insured up to <unk> he adds
<unk> <unk> is n't unique
especially at times like these when declining rates make it hard for investors to get yields <unk> they have come to expect too many people chase the promise of above - market returns without fully appreciating the risk
yield greed often gets in the way of understanding things says <unk> <unk> research director of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> a <unk> - based educational group
the biggest problem n we have is that investors realize after the fact that they did n't understand what they were investing in
<unk> <unk> concedes <unk> he did n't fully understand what he was buying
he says that he knew n he was getting a zero - coupon cd and that he had previously invested in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> receipts a type of zero - coupon <unk> security sold by <unk> <unk>
but he says <unk> he did n't understand <unk> he was buying the <unk> on the secondary market and he contends n his broker never fully explained the risks
the broker <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> office refuses to discuss the matter with a reporter referring inquiries to <unk> <unk> officials in <unk> <unk>
those officials say n there was full disclosure of the risks in a fact sheet sent to all <unk> investors with their confirmation of sale
the fact sheet dated <unk> n says on page three if the price paid for a <unk> purchased in the secondary market is higher than the accreted value in the case of zero - coupon cds the difference is not insured
computations involving zero - coupon cds are more complicated and you should discuss any questions n you may have with your financial consultant
<unk> <unk> says <unk> he does n't remember the paragraph about premiums in the fact sheet <unk> he received and did n't realize <unk> part of what he paid was a premium
i assumed n i was buying a <unk> as a <unk> he says
nevertheless <unk> <unk> has agreed that if the thrift that issued <unk> <unk> <unk> peoples <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> is liquidated and the <unk> terminated the brokerage firm would cover the premium <unk> <unk> <unk> paid
federal deposit insurance would pay principal and interest accrued to the date of liquidation to a maximum of <unk>
it not a blanket commitment it a case - by-case situation says <unk> <unk> a managing director of <unk> <unk> <unk> markets <unk>
there a question whether brokers at the time were fully aware of the risks
we were n't sure that full disclosure as we wanted it was being made
<unk> <unk> says n it impossible to estimate how many investors are in <unk> <unk> situation although it says <unk> the firm has received only one other complaint about premiums on the secondary market in three years
<unk> <unk> now provides credit rating information about the institutions whose cds it sells which it did n't provide in <unk>
zero - coupon cds are only a small portion of the <unk> trillion - plus in cds outstanding and those purchased on the secondary market are an even smaller part of the total
<unk> <unk> estimates that fewer than n financial institutions currently issue zero - coupon cds
still there are several billion dollars of zero - coupon cds with various maturities outstanding
because of the tax consequences of zero - coupon investments income tax is payable in the year n interest is accrued although interest is n't actually paid until maturity zero - coupon cds are usually sold for tax - advantaged accounts to finance things like retirement and children education
most zero - coupon cds are in maturities of six to nine years and they usually double in value by maturity
but investors who bought zero - coupon cds in the secondary market are n't the only ones who may be surprised to learn <unk> the full amount of their investments is n't insured
people who paid a premium for standard cds purchased on the secondary market could also find that those premiums are n't insured if the institutions that issued the cds failed
however those premiums are usually far smaller than on zero - coupon cds and the simpler pricing structure of a standard cd makes it more apparent when a premium is paid
whatever the case a <unk> <unk> spokesman emphasizes n investors should n't have to worry about the uninsured premium issue unless the bank or thrift that issued the <unk> is closed and its deposits paid off before maturity or transferred to another institution at a lower rate
<unk> <unk> says <unk> he satisfied that his problem has been resolved
and he says <unk> he learned a lesson you always have to watch out for yourself
no one else will watch out for you
americans are drinking less but young professionals from <unk> to <unk> <unk> are rushing to buy premium - brand american vodka brandy and other spirits
in particular many are snubbing the scotch preferred by their parents and opting for bourbon the sweet firewater from the <unk> countryside
with <unk> liquor consumption declining steadily many american producers are stepping up their marketing efforts abroad
and those efforts are paying off spirits exports jumped more than <unk> <unk> times to n million in <unk> from n million in <unk> according to the <unk> spirits <unk> of the <unk> a trade group
spirits companies now view themselves as global marketers says <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> <unk> a research and consulting firm
if you want to be a player you have to be in <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk>
you must have world - class brands a long - term perspective and deep pockets
the internationalization of the industry has been hastened by foreign companies acquisitions of many <unk> producers
in recent years for example <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> acquired <unk> <unk> while another british company <unk> <unk> took over <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> industries <unk>
but the shift has also been fueled by necessity
while premium - brand spirits like <unk> vodka and <unk> <unk> whiskey are riding high in the <unk> domestic spirits consumption fell <unk> to n million cases in <unk> from n million cases in <unk>
in recent years growth has come in the foreign markets
<unk> brandy exports more than doubled last year to <unk> proof gallons a standard industry measure according to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> an industry association
exports of rum surged <unk> to n proof gallons
<unk> is the biggest importer of both rum and brandy from the <unk>
<unk> the world third - largest liquor market after the <unk> and <unk> helped american companies in <unk> when it lowered its tax on imported spirits and levied a tax on many domestic products
<unk> wineries benefiting from lowered trade barriers and federal marketing subsidies are expanding aggressively into <unk> as well as <unk> and <unk> <unk>
in <unk> the wineries are promoting their products pacific roots and courting restaurant and hotel chefs whose recommendations carry weight
in <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> - <unk> <unk> has increased its marketing of <unk> <unk> <unk>
using cinema television and print ads the company pitches <unk> <unk> as a grand old drink of the antebellum <unk> <unk>
the biggest foreign inroads though have been made by bourbon
while <unk> makers of vodka rum and other spirits compete against powerhouses abroad trade agreements prohibit any other country from making bourbon
all bourbon comes from <unk> though <unk> <unk> <unk> whiskey often is counted as bourbon because of similarity of taste
moreover just as vodka has acquired an upscale image in the <unk> bourbon has become fashionable in many foreign countries a uniquely american product tied to frontier folklore
how was the <unk> won

we imagine with bourbon the <unk> <unk> <unk> motion pictures and gunmen appearing says <unk> <unk> vice president of <unk> <unk> <unk> a division of <unk> <unk> <unk> largest liquor company

systemwide sales which include sales at franchisee as well as company - owned stores totaled n billion compared with n billion
but sales for <unk> franchisees were flat at best on a per - store basis despite weak <unk> figures
compared with the first nine months of last year average franchisee store sales this year were down nearly n reflecting a fierce discounting war among fast - food chains
since <unk> menu prices rose this year the actual decline may have been more
<unk> closed at <unk> up <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> composite trading yesterday
while franchisees were having a tough time holding sales <unk> company - operated stores posted hefty gains for the nine months with sales per company - operated unit rising n
one analyst noted that the company often has better store locations than do its franchisees thus aiding promotional efforts
on average in the latest nine months company - operated units in the <unk> had n more in sales than did franchised outlets
there are more than three times as many franchised domestic outlets as there are company stores
profit margins at <unk> company - owned stores in the quarter were up nearly n which the company attributed in part to lower food costs
<unk> - <unk> securities analyst <unk> <unk> said <unk> reduced labor costs helped boost margins although she doubted <unk> that kind of performance is sustainable
calling sales still relatively soft <unk> <unk> believes that in real terms <unk> sales slipped <unk> <unk> to n at company - operated stores in the quarter
apparently acknowledging weaker <unk> sales systemwide <unk> vowed to use our size and muscle to do all that is necessary to build the brand
overseas both franchisees and the company performed substantially better than a year ago
third - quarter sales in <unk> were exceptionally strong boosted by promotional programs and new products although weaker foreign currencies reduced the company earnings
<unk> said that systemwide sales would have been n million greater had n exchange rates remained in effect
going into the fourth quarter the sales comparison will be more difficult predicted restaurant analyst <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>
reflecting better growth prospects abroad <unk> noted that as of <unk> <unk> more stores were under construction overseas than a year ago while the opposite was true for domestic expansion

<unk> <unk> lines <unk> common stock was dragged down yesterday amid concerns that a bankruptcy filing by a finnish shipbuilder would delay delivery of three big cruise ships
the <unk> - based company stock fell <unk> yesterday to n a share in heavy <unk> <unk> <unk> composite trading
early yesterday <unk> said in a company statement that it had been notified unofficially that <unk> <unk> industries the finnish shipyard that is building its three new cruise ships planned to file for bankruptcy
officials at <unk> declined to comment
there is just a tremendous amount of uncertainty about what the effect if any of all this is said <unk> <unk> <unk> an analyst at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
i did n't even know that a company in a socialistic country could file for bankruptcy
<unk> said n the <unk> the first of the three n million ships that <unk> has on order is scheduled to be delivered next month just in time for the winter tourist season in the <unk>
that ship which would carry about n passengers would expand the capacity of <unk> existing n fleet by <unk>
the second ship which is half - completed is scheduled to be delivered in fall n and the third in fall n
there a n chance that the <unk> will be delivered close to schedule said <unk> <unk> an analyst at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the others will probably be delivered as well but <unk> will likely have to pay a higher price for them
she said n the company could pay as much as <unk> more for the ships
if the ships are n't delivered however it will likely have an effect on the company earnings as soon as the <unk> fiscal year which begins <unk> n
analysts said n those estimates which range from about <unk> a share to n a share are based on <unk> being in operation in <unk>
if the ship fails to arrive those per - share earnings estimates could be trimmed <unk> cents or more
analysts were n't willing to speculate on how much money <unk> might lose through deposits
normally a company pays a portion of the total cost of a ship as it reaches various stages of construction
<unk> for example has already paid about n million of the total cost for <unk>
some analysts say n this may give it the right n to seize the ship if the situation warrants it
according to reports from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by conglomerate <unk> <unk> filed for bankruptcy yesterday after the shipyard contractors had started to demand bank guarantees

<unk> <unk> had a n drop in third - quarter profit mainly because of lower sales of truck parts its largest and most profitable single business
sales of medium and heavy - duty trucks continue to lag previous - year rates leading <unk> to expect fourth - quarter net income to fall below year - earlier levels said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> vice chairman and chief financial and administrative officer
he declined to make a specific earnings estimate
third - quarter net was n million or <unk> a share from n million or <unk> a share a year ago
sales rose <unk> to n million from n million
the quarter net was below analyst expectations mainly because truck - parts sales did n't rebound in <unk> from the summer doldrums as they usually do said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> analyst with <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> who had been expecting quarter profit of about <unk> a share says n he is reducing his estimate for the year to the area of <unk> a share from his previous estimate of <unk>
<unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> who a couple of weeks ago reduced his n estimate to n a share because of the weakening truck market says <unk> he will make another cut to about <unk> a share in light of the third - quarter report
he said n <unk> quarter profit margin on controls was lower than he anticipated
<unk> said n sales of truck axles transmissions and other parts fell <unk> to n million
sales of parts for cars and construction vehicles rose
<unk> does n't provide profit figures separately for each category but operating profit for vehicle parts as a group fell <unk> to n million on an about n drop in sales to n million
<unk> <unk> said <unk> truck - fleet operators appear to be cautious about buying new trucks until they see how the economy behaves
the truck sales slowdown reflects the general slowing in sales of consumer goods he said <unk> and the latest reports show a slight improvement rather than any indication of a downward spiral
operating profit from electrical and electronics controls <unk> other major business group fell <unk> to n million despite a <unk> increase in sales to n million
the company attributed the decline to weakness in the commercial - switch market in <unk> <unk> and in the european appliance - controls market
for the nine months net including profit from discontinued operations both years and in <unk> an extraordinary charge of n million related to settlement of a lawsuit was n million or <unk> a share up n from n million or <unk> a share a year ago

in <unk> rapid shift from socialism to an undefined alternative environmental issues have become a cutting edge of broader movements to restructure the economy cut cumbersome bureaucracies and democratize local politics
initial steps were taken at <unk> first international environmental conference which i attended last month
the conference held in <unk> <unk> was co - sponsored by the <unk> <unk> the <unk> brothers <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and was attended by <unk> poles from government and industry as well as hungarians czechs russians japanese and americans
the conference was entitled <unk> mechanisms for <unk> <unk> a significant departure from <unk> <unk> usage which recognizes only one economic mechanism central planning <unk> to direct industrial behavior
even more remarkably it focused on emissions trading and similar market approaches n to address pollution notwithstanding <unk> lack of functioning markets
why did <unk> <unk> participants unanimously endorse market - based pollution approaches
the answer lies both in the degraded environment of these countries and the perceived causes of that degradation
like other <unk> <unk> countries <unk> possesses environmental laws more honored in their breach than in their observance
according to a detailed report by <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> n areas containing a third of <unk> population are regarded as ecological hazards due to multiple violations of standards
norms are consistently exceeded at n of nitrogen oxide monitoring sites and n of those for dust and soot emissions
four - fifths of <unk> soils have become highly acidified n of its southern forests are projected to die by century end
between <unk> and <unk> polish waters fit for human consumption dropped from <unk> to n of all surface waters while those unfit even for industry use nearly doubled
<unk> produces about n times more soot and five times more sulfur dioxide and solid waste per unit of gross national product than does <unk> <unk>
its mortality rate for males over <unk> is about n higher than <unk> <unk> and <unk> higher in hazard areas than the national average
since <unk> average annual growth rates for most pollutants have outstripped the growth of <unk>
conference participants saw these effects as flowing directly from a marxist devaluation of environmental resources which are not produced by labor b planned economies inability to control pollution where enterprises are state - owned and penalties are paid by the government and c the continuing stalinist emphasis on heavy industry for economic development producing a far heavier and more wasteful use of energy and natural resources than in the <unk>
they repeatedly noted that environmental progress could not be secured without true ownership genuine competition based on market factors and the risk of bankruptcy if a business makes the wrong decisions
the solutions n they formally proposed included lead\/sulfur taxes conservation and recycling incentives reforestation offsets transferable pollution permits an ecological bank n to finance pollution - reduction credits and debt - for-environment swaps
but their most fundamental recommendation was to separate industry from the state making it fully accountable for pollution control
a revolution takes more than conference manifestos
indeed skepticism was amply captured by a joke told by poles at the conference the world must be coming to an end
the russians are talking peace
the palestinians are talking elections
and the poles are engaged in commerce
but the implications of such a shift to market approaches go well beyond the fact that <unk> is already working on nationwide emissions trades n to reduce smelter pollution or that the soviets plan to introduce marketable pollution permits in some republics next year
those implications include <unk>
faced with a n billion foreign debt and skyrocketing inflation <unk> must privatize industry and eliminate subsidies to stabilize its currency and qualify for international assistance
market - based pollution control may consume some capital that would otherwise purchase state industries
but it could also accelerate marketization by reinforcing industrial accountability breaking up state monopolies giving managers a stake in solutions and ensuring that modernization is not reversible for failure to address environmental effects
least - cost solutions
as conferees noted scarce capital means n the costs of control must be minimized through a broad menu of compliance choices for individual firms
that means simple clear rules that secure the first large blocks of reduction deferring more complex issues such as risk
it also means use of quantity - based pollution limits such as transferable permits rather than price - based limits such as effluent fees
that because quota - trained managers will likely respond better to quantity than to price signals
creative financing
even least - cost environmental solutions will require billions of dollars
new types of financing must make funds available without draining <unk> hard - currency reserves
democratization
<unk> <unk> pollution data typically have been state secrets
while polish data have been freely available since <unk> it was no accident that participants urged the free flow of information
for once information flows public participation follows and repression becomes difficult to reimpose
global reciprocity
one participant prematurely declared that <unk> has had a free market in goods but a planned economy for environmental protection while <unk> represents the opposite
his point it will be increasingly difficult for the <unk> to cling to command - and-control measures if even the <unk> <unk> steps to a different drummer
at the moment <unk> resembles n <unk> more than a modern industrial society with antiquated production inadequate environmental management and little ecological awareness
but the continuing pressures for free - market economics suggest <unk> the conference vision was not all fantasy

it nothing dramatic just a routine sell - off
some of it was due to lower - than-expected earnings from leading companies he said n

why ca n't we teach our children to read write and reckon
it not that we do n't know how to because we do
it that we do n't want to
and the reason n we do n't want to is that effective education would require us to relinquish some cherished metaphysical beliefs about human nature in general and the human nature of young people in particular as well as to violate some cherished vested interests
these beliefs so dominate our educational establishment our media our politicians and even our parents that it seems almost blasphemous to challenge them
here is an example
if i were to ask a sample of american parents do you wish the elementary schools to encourage creativity in your children the near - unanimous answer would be yes of course
but what do we mean specifically by creativity
no one can say
in practice it ends up being equated with a self - expression that encourages the youngsters self - esteem
the result is a generation of young people whose ignorance and intellectual incompetence is matched only by their good opinion of themselves
the whole notion of creativity in education was and is part and parcel of a romantic rebellion against disciplined instruction which was and is regarded as authoritarian a repression and frustration of the latent talents and the wonderful if as yet undefined potentialities inherent in the souls of all our children
it is not surprising that parents find this romantic extravagance so attractive
fortunately these same parents do want their children to get a decent education as traditionally understood and they have enough common sense to know what that demands
their commitment to creativity can not survive adolescent illiteracy
american education future will be determined by the degree to which we all of us allow this common sense to prevail over the illusions that we also share
the education establishment will fight against common sense every inch of the way
the reasons are complex but one simple reason ought not to be underestimated
progressive education n as it was once called is far more interesting and agreeable to teachers than is disciplined instruction
it is nice for teachers to think n they are engaged in personality development and even nicer to minimize those irksome tests with often disappointing results
it also provides teachers with a superior self - definition as a profession since they will have passed courses in educational psychology and educational philosophy
i myself took such courses in college thinking <unk> i might end up a schoolteacher
they could all fairly be described as pap courses
but it is unfair to dump on teachers as distinct from the educational establishment
i know many schoolteachers and on the whole they are seriously committed to conscientious teaching
they may not be among the best and brightest of their generation there are very few such people by definition
but they need not be to do their jobs well
yes we all can remember one or two truly inspiring teachers from our school days
but our education proceeded at the hands of those others who were merely competent and conscientious
in this sense a teacher can be compared to one family doctor
if he were brilliant he probably would not be a family doctor in the first place
if he is competent and conscientious he serves us well
our teachers are not an important factor in our educational crisis
whether they are or are not underpaid is a problem of equity it is not an educational problem
it is silly libel on our teachers to think n they would educate our children better if only they got a few thousand dollars a year more
it is the kind of libel n the teachers unions do n't mind spreading for their own narrow purposes
it is also the kind of libel n politicians find useful since it helps them strike a friendly posture on behalf of an important constituency
but there is not one shred of evidence that other things being equal salary differentials result in educational differentials
if there were such evidence you can be sure n you would have heard of it
if we wish to be serious about american education we know exactly what to do and just as important what not to do
there are many successful schools scattered throughout this nation some of them in the poorest of ghettos and they are all sending us the same message
conversely there are the majority of unsuccessful schools and we know which efforts at educational reform are doomed beforehand
we really do know all n we need to know if only we could assimilate this knowledge into our thinking
in this respect it would be helpful if our political leaders were mute rather than eloquently concerned
they are inevitably inclined to echo the conventional pap since this is the least controversial option that is open to them
thus at the recent governors conference on education <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> announced that this country needs a comprehensive child - development policy for children under five
a comprehensive development policy for governors over <unk> would seem to be a more pressing need
what <unk> <unk> is advocating in effect is extending the educational system down to the pre - kindergarten years
whether desirable or not this is a child - care program not an educational program
we know that very early exposure to schooling improves performance in the first grade but afterward the difference is quickly washed away
let us sum up what we do know about education and about those education reforms that do work and do n't work parental involvement is a bad idea
parents are too likely to blame schools for the educational limitations of their children
parents should be involved with their children education at home not in school
they should see to it that their kids do n't play truant they should make certain that the children spend enough time n doing homework they should scrutinize the report card
if parents are dissatisfied with a school they should have the option of switching to another
community involvement is an even worse idea
here the experience of <unk> <unk> <unk> is decisive
locally elected school boards especially in our larger cities become the prey of ambitious generally corrupt and invariably demagogic local politicians or would - be politicians
<unk> <unk> is in the process of trying to disengage itself from a <unk> commitment to this system of school governance even as <unk> and other cities are moving to institute it
in most states increasing expenditures on education in our current circumstances will probably make things worse not better
the reason is simple education takes place in the classroom where the influence of money is minimal
decades of educational research tell us unequivocally that even smaller classes have zero effect on the academic performance of the pupils though they may sometimes be desirable for other reasons
the new money flows into the already top - heavy administrative structure which busies itself piling more and more paper work on the teachers
there is neither mystery nor paradox in the fact that as educational expenditures in real terms have increased sharply in the past quarter - of-a-century we now spend more per pupil than any other country in the world educational performance has declined
that is the way n the system works
students should move up the educational ladder as their academic potential allows
no student should be permitted to be graduated from elementary school without having mastered the <unk> r at the level that prevailed n years ago
this means tracking whose main purpose is less to permit the gifted youngsters to flourish though that is clearly desirable than to ensure that the less gifted get the necessary grounding for further study or for entering the modern world of work
the notion that tracking is somehow undemocratic is absurd
the purpose of education is to encourage young men and women to realize their full academic potential
no one in his right mind actually believes that we all have an equal academic potential
it is generally desirable to use older textbooks many of them alas out of print rather than newer ones
the latter are modish trendy often downright silly and at best insubstantial
they are based on dubious psychological and sociological theories rather than on educational experience
one of the reasons n american students do so poorly in math tests as compared with british french german or japanese students is the influence of the <unk> <unk> on american textbooks and teaching methods
anyone who wants to appreciate just how bizarre this situation is with students who ca n't add or subtract learning the conceptual basis of mathematical theory should read the article by <unk> <unk> himself a recent math major at <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk>
most important of all schools should have principals with a large measure of authority over the faculty the curriculum and all matters of student discipline
study after study the most recent from the <unk> <unk> tells us that the best schools are those that are free of outside interference and are governed by a powerful head
with that authority of course goes an unambiguous accountability
schools that are structured in this way produce students with higher morale and superior academic performance
this is a fact though in view of all the feathers that are ruffled by this fact it is not surprising that one hears so little about it
<unk> <unk> an <unk> <unk> <unk> fellow <unk> - edits the <unk> <unk> and publishes the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> machines <unk> unveiled a broad strategy n to tackle the biggest problem that manufacturers face when computerizing their operations most machines ca n't talk to each other
the company unveiled more than <unk> products mostly software that are designed to integrate the three areas of a manufacturing operation the plant floor design operations and production planning
the aim ultimately is to increase the flow of information into a manufacturer main computer network for use in business planning marketing and other operations
manufacturers have already spent so heavily on automation that they are one of the computer industry leading revenue sources
but many manufacturers find that communication between different computers has been rendered nearly impossible by the babel of computer languages used by different machines including robots and machine tools
<unk> announcement which was expected and will formally be made to customers today also marks an attempt to gain credibility on the plant floor where <unk> <unk> <unk> has long dominated and where <unk> - <unk> <unk> has recently gained market share
consultants have said that it will take a while for all the pieces of the <unk> strategy to fall into place even though the specific products n <unk> unveiled will generally be available by the end of the first quarter
<unk> <unk> a consultant in <unk> <unk> said that in the past <unk> has developed broad software strategies only for problems that crossed industry lines
he said <unk> he believes <unk> <unk> decision to invest this sort of effort into a single industry showed that it was getting serious about understanding customers problems and was n't just selling technology
he said <unk> he expects <unk> to unveil similar strategies for other industries in coming months
<unk> push is also unusual in its approach to marketing
rather than just send out marketing people to knock on customers doors <unk> is making several hundred of its own manufacturing people available to discuss specific needs
<unk> manufacturing staff also will be able to provide software that <unk> has developed internally and will be able to form teams with a customer <unk> to jointly solve manufacturing problems
<unk> can obviously bring its expertise to bear on problems related to computer manufacturing but it could also help customers on software n to deal with such things as changes in engineering documents
we may not have every manufacturing problem but we have most said <unk> <unk> <unk> top marketing official

the tougher new regulations under the savings - and-loan bailout law are accelerating the thrift industry shrinking act
largely to meet tougher new capital requirements thrifts reduced their assets n billion in <unk> by selling such assets as mortgage - backed securities and loans
industry assets as of <unk> <unk> were n trillion the lowest since <unk> <unk>
as thrifts sell assets to improve their capital - to-asset ratio as required under the new law passed in <unk> they must also reduce liabilities such as deposits
as interest rates paid depositors were lowered thrift withdrawals exceeded deposits by n billion not including interest credited to accounts
it was the third consecutive month in which thrifts shed assets to increase the size of their capital in relation to their assets the <unk> of <unk> <unk> said <unk>
the asset shrinkage was particularly concentrated in several large <unk> institutions
the downsizing of the thrift industry is well under way said <unk> <unk> an industry consultant in <unk> <unk>
this suggests <unk> the bailout law is having a more dramatic effect than anyone would have imagined so soon
<unk> <unk> an economist with the <unk> of <unk> <unk> also attributed some of the outflow to seasonal factors
<unk> is a month when people are paying school tuition he said
that and adjustment to the new law were the biggest factors in the industry
not including thrifts under government conservatorship <unk> reduced their assets by n billion from the previous month and deposit outflows totaled n billion
for the <unk> insolvent thrifts under government management at the end of <unk> assets declined by n billion and withdrawals exceeded deposits by n billion
thrifts raised capital mostly by selling mortgages and mortgage - backed securities which were reduced by n billion in <unk> from the prior month
as of <unk> n thrifts held n billion in mortgage - backed securities
the deposit numbers for <unk> marked a swing back to huge outflows after a <unk> net deposit inflow of n million the only net inflow in more than a year
deposits are n't expected to exceed withdrawals in the foreseeable future as the industry continues to shrink
i think n we are going to see deposit shrinkage continue unless we see big changes in rates <unk> <unk> said
for the first eight months of n thrifts withdrawals exceeded deposits by n billion
for the prior year deposits exceeded withdrawals by n billion
the estimates of real gross national product prepared by the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> significantly understate the rate of economic growth
since the bureau estimates for the business sector provide the numerator for the productivity ratios calculated by the <unk> of <unk> underestimated growth rates artificially depress official productivity statistics
if this thesis is correct it has important implications for macroeconomic policies it may lower the sense of urgency behind efforts n to enact tax incentives and other measures <unk> to increase the rate of growth in productivity and real <unk>
it would also affect the perceptions of the board of governors of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the informed public generally as to what constitutes a reasonable degree of price stability
in the early <unk> i predicted a significant acceleration in productivity growth over the rest of the decade
this forecast was based on the apparent reversal of most of the negative forces such as demographic changes the oil shock and accelerating inflation that had reduced productivity gains in the n
there has indeed been more than a one percentage point improvement in productivity growth since <unk>
but i had expected more which is one reason n i began looking at evidence suggesting defects in the official output estimates
the evidence does not clearly support the view that the downward bias in output growth has become greater during the n period but all <unk> i am claiming is that the growth trend is understated
it is however possible that further study will reveal increasing bias
this bias is in no way deliberate
the understatement of growth is due largely to the conservative expedients adopted to deal with deficiencies in basic economic data
the first of three major sources of error is the use of labor input estimates mainly employment or hours instead of output estimates for those sectors such as governments paid household services and private non - profit institutions where there are difficulties in assembling output data
this means that no allowance is made for possible increases in output per unit of labor
in an unrelated program in which the <unk> <unk> does estimate output per employee for more than two - thirds of federal civilian employees it found an average annual rate of productivity improvement of n during the n
even if it is assumed that productivity rose no more than half as quickly in the rest of the nonbusiness sector this <unk> <unk> estimate indicates a downward bias in the real gnp estimates of n percentage point a year on average
the federal productivity estimators use labor input rather than output data for their calculations of half of private financial and service industries as well
independent estimates of output in those industries including one by the <unk> of <unk> for banking suggests that productivity in finance and services appears to have risen by an average of at least <unk> a year between <unk> and <unk>
because finance and services contribute n to final business product missing these productivity improvements depresses the overall growth rate by <unk> a year
the second source of error in growth statistics is the use of inappropriate deflators n to adjust for price changes
i estimate that these mismeasurements as detailed by <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> add a further n percentage point to the downward bias in the growth rate of real business product
finally the official estimates understate growth because they make inadequate allowance for improvements in quality of goods and services
in <unk> a new price index for computers adjusted for changes in performance characteristics was introduced and that resulted in a significantly larger increase in real outlays for durable goods than the earlier estimates had showed
since then further research argues that failure to take account of quality improvements has contributed a total of at least n percentage point to the downward bias in the growth rate
in sum the biases ennumerated above indicate a n percentage point understatement in growth of total real gnp
for the private domestic business economy the bias was a bit over n percentage point
in other words the growth rates of both total <unk> and real private business product per labor hour have been underestimated by about <unk>
<unk> <unk> is professor emeritus of economics at <unk> <unk> <unk>

<unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> third - quarter net income plunged n from a year earlier on weakness in the company mainstay chemicals and plastics business
net was n million or n cents a share for the quarter compared with n million or <unk> a share a year ago
sales were <unk> billion up <unk> from n billion the previous year
<unk> like other companies with a heavy reliance on the so - called commodity end of the chemicals industry was expected to post earnings sharply lower than in an exceptionally strong n third quarter
but the company latest quarter was a few pennies a share lower than the more pessimistic projections on <unk> <unk>
it certainly was n't a disaster but it does show weakness in some of the company chief markets said <unk> <unk> <unk> a chemicals - industry analyst at <unk> <unk>
in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> composite trading carbide closed at <unk> a share down n cents
prices for polyethylene a common plastic and an important <unk> product started to fall early this year the slide accelerated in the third quarter as buyers continued to trim inventories
prices also fell for ethylene oxide and glycols products used in making antifreeze
some producers of polyethylene figuring n the inventory reductions are near an end have announced price boosts
the first real test of whether prices have hit bottom may come in the next several weeks when the new prices become effective
a <unk> spokesman said n the conditions are right for the increase to hold
for the third quarter operating profit from <unk> chemicals and plastics business fell to n million from n million a year ago before accounting for taxes and interest expense
operating profit from carbon products such as graphite electrodes also declined to n million from n million
in the industrial - gases segment operating profit climbed to n million from n million
the latest quarter included a gain of about n million on the sale of the company urethane polyols and propylene glycols businesses
propylene glycols are used in making personal - care products such as shampoo and urethane polyols are used in making the polyurethane foam found in furniture cushioning and other products
that gain was mostly offset by a loss of about n million from a write - down in its polysilicon business
polysilicon is used in making integrated circuits
for the nine months net totaled n million or <unk> a share up n from n million or <unk> a share a year ago
sales rose <unk> to n billion from n billion
at least n states are resisting <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> nationwide effort n to settle its legal troubles and some might instead try to revoke the firm license n to sell securities within their borders
the reluctance of some states n to let <unk> off the hook could hamper the firm attempts to polish its image after its guilty plea to six felonies last month say <unk> several people familiar with the discussions
up to now <unk> has made a rapid - fire series of settlements with n states and the commonwealth of <unk> <unk>
just yesterday <unk> <unk> announced n it made a n settlement with <unk> a record - tying fine for a securities - law matter in that state
these states have been entering into settlements with <unk> as part of the firm efforts <unk> to operate freely anywhere in the <unk> despite its record as an admitted felon
but individuals familiar with the generally successful <unk> talks say n the firm is meeting resistance from some big states including <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
officials in some of these states say n they do n't want to simply accept the settlements offered by <unk>
they question if <unk> is getting easier treatment than the many small penny - stock firms whose brokerage licenses are routinely revoked
<unk> has to settle with state securities regulators in the wake of its criminal guilty plea and a related civil settlement with the securities and <unk> <unk> that includes payment of n million in penalties
these stem from a two - year federal investigation of insider trading and securities fraud on <unk> <unk>
<unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> have been less resistant to <unk> than the other six states but nonetheless have refused to settle so far say n those familiar with the discussions
<unk> says <unk> it does n't expect <unk> any of its state brokerage licenses will be revoked and even if some are its securities business would n't be directly hurt
it already has sold its retail or individual - investor brokerage network securities firms do n't need brokerage licenses for non - retail activities such as investment banking
still if nothing else a revoked brokerage license could be a burden because it must be disclosed in many of the transactions in which <unk> could be involved
securities regulators praise <unk> for its energetic effort led by government - approved general counsel <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to settle its legal problems with the states
but they disagree about the message n these settlements give to the public
there was a lot of internal debate about that specific issue said <unk> <unk> <unk> chief securities regulator and president of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which drafted a voluntary settlement plan for the states with <unk>
the question she said <unk> is whether <unk> should be allowed to pay and move on or whether you should simply revoke the license when someone is convicted of a felony
while <unk> <unk> state went ahead and accepted <unk> settlement offer of <unk> she said i do n't have any argument with those who came to different conclusions
i can see both sides
similarly <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> director of securities regulation said <unk> his state had n't received any complaints about <unk> so it really could n't press the issue
still i understand the reasons that other states are holding out he said n
<unk> <unk> the <unk> general counsel said i do n't think as we say in investment banking that by the end of the day we be losing any licenses
asked about states that are taking a hard line he said there are states that have asked for additional information which we are providing to them
<unk> <unk> said <unk> more than n million has been paid to n states and that <unk> still expects to pay out a total of n million
by the end of this week <unk> should have another three to four settlements <unk> <unk> said
the rate n we going i think that by the end of the month we looking to have a total of n to n he said
that total would be important for <unk>
the investment bank has previously announced that as part of its punishment it would create an independent foundation n to promote ethical behavior in the securities industry
a proviso to that promise is that a minimum of n states reach settlement agreements before next <unk>
there are according to several securities commissioners at least n states that are either close to settlements with <unk> or who do n't appear opposed to settling
<unk> proposed state fines have been based on a state population and on the size of <unk> business in the state
<unk> <unk> for example was asked to accept <unk> but refused
the state is n't ruling out revoking <unk> brokerage license
the state can also bar <unk> as an investment adviser
state officials wo n't describe their position in detail but <unk> <unk> <unk> state securities chief said we really are still looking at it and have informed <unk> that the proposal is really not sufficient for settlement
<unk> already has issued a notice of intent to revoke <unk> brokerage license
it is one of the states that have met with <unk> <unk> and asked for additional information about investors accounts and other matters
this particular issue goes to the very integrity of the capital - formation market state <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said
a banking department spokesman added <unk> <unk> does n't feel <unk> that money alone is the issue here
particularly touchy are the cases of <unk> <unk> which is <unk> base and <unk> the base of <unk> highly profitable junk - bond operation that led to the firm legal difficulties
neither state has settled and officials in the two states wo n't discuss their reasons for not doing so
but <unk> has made it clear n it could mount a significant legal battle in each state if its license is revoked according to state officials
<unk> <unk> the head of the state securities group said <unk> <unk> has done a better job of settling with the states than <unk> <unk> did after its guilty plea to a massive check - kiting scheme several years ago
still she said <unk> <unk> trouble with some states is n't a bad thing
this process should point out that it not going to be easy for a firm that convicted of a felony to immediately jump back into the retail business <unk> <unk> said
we need to have somebody worried so they do n't do this again
these are the n states including the commonwealth of <unk> <unk> that have settled with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> reported a third - quarter net loss of n million or n cents a share reflecting acquisition costs for a <unk> stake in <unk> communications <unk> and the purchase method of accounting for the transaction
separately <unk> reported a net loss of n million or n cents a share including merger expenses of n million and n million in charges associated with stock - appreciation-based compensation plans
<unk> <unk> is in the process of completing its acquisition of the remaining <unk> shares
<unk> <unk> emphasized in a news release that it should be evaluated based on its cash flow which the company defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization
on a pro - forma basis assuming <unk> the merger was effective <unk> <unk> <unk> including the results from both <unk> <unk> and all of <unk> that cash flow figure would be n million for the latest quarter more than double the comparable figure a year ago or n million according to <unk> <unk>
some analysts at least are buying that argument and were n't alarmed by the losses
what really matters is the operating income of the divisions i look at these numbers and i say these businesses are doing well said <unk> <unk> a vice president of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
for example <unk> made more than n million from filmed entertainment in three months
that a big number
<unk> also had a gain of more than <unk> from records and music publishing even though the domestic record business was sluggish this summer
in the year - ago third quarter <unk> on its own reported net income of n million or <unk> a share
combined revenue for the latest quarter of <unk> <unk> was <unk> billion compared with the year - ago <unk> revenue of <unk> billion
on a pro forma basis including all of <unk> earnings <unk> <unk> had a third - quarter loss of n million compared with a n million loss a year earlier
on the same basis revenue rose to n billion from n billion
for the third quarter <unk> <unk> million loss compared with a year - ago loss of n million or n cents a share
revenue rose to n billion from n billion
the n figures were restated to include the results of <unk> telepictures <unk> which <unk> acquired in <unk>
<unk> <unk> operating earnings got a boost from <unk> record box - office results
batman alone has racked up more than n million in box - office receipts to date making it <unk> <unk> largest grossing film ever
lethal <unk> <unk> was also a big hit
<unk> also contributed record results from its music business where unit sales of compact discs rose more than <unk> from a year ago the company said <unk> helped by <unk> <unk> soundtrack
<unk> <unk> said <unk> its cable division turned in a n increase in operating cash flow to n million from n million reflecting higher per - subscriber revenue
in addition the <unk> results included a n million charge reflecting a reserve for relocation related expenses at american <unk> <unk> <unk>
on the other hand <unk> <unk> said <unk> its operating cash flow declined in the quarter for its magazine division its books division and the <unk> <unk> <unk> programming division
in magazines higher advertising revenues at sports <unk> and <unk> were offset by lower ad revenue for other major magazines
the programming division saw a decline in operating cash flow because the year - ago quarter included a n million dividend from <unk> <unk> <unk> and because the quarter includes expenses associated with the <unk> n launch of <unk> <unk> <unk>
in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> composite trading <unk> <unk> closed at <unk> a share up n while <unk> closed at <unk> a share up n cents
<unk> <unk> <unk> president and chief executive officer will take early retirement from this steelmaker <unk> <unk>

<unk> recently emerged from bankruptcy - law proceedings that left n of the reorganized company common stock in the hands of trustees of an asbestos - disease claims trust
the company said n it would have no further comment
<unk> <unk> <unk> was elected chairman earlier this year by the company new board having served as vice president for legal and corporate affairs

some <unk> democrats are trying to head off an appointment by <unk> <unk> to the board that oversees the savings - and-loan bailout contending that the prospective nominee is the head of troubled banks himself
four democrats on the <unk> <unk> <unk> sent <unk> <unk> a letter stating their concerns about the expected appointment of <unk> <unk> an <unk> banker and former fund - raiser for <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
the <unk> <unk> created in the savings - and-loan law signed in <unk> sets policy for the <unk> which will sell hundreds of the nation sick thrifts and billions of dollars of their assets
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are members of the board
<unk> <unk> must appoint two other members one a <unk> and one a <unk>
an administration official confirmed last week that <unk> <unk> the chairman of <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> is the <unk> appointee and that a security clearance was under way
the democratic appointee has n't been determined the official said <unk>
<unk> <unk> declined to comment and the <unk> <unk> said <unk> the congressmen letter is under review
the letter dated last <unk> cited the losses at <unk> <unk> and at <unk> <unk> also of <unk> where <unk> <unk> was chairman for n years
both banks have been battered as have other <unk> banks by falling real estate prices
<unk> <unk> for example had n million in problem assets as of <unk>
we believe that there are numerous other candidates more qualified for this important position and we encourage you to give them your thorough consideration before making this key <unk> appointment the letter said
the <unk> needs the most able competent management available
but <unk> <unk> has long ties to both republicans and banking
he was co - chairman of <unk> <unk> <unk> campaign committee in last year election and also worked for <unk> <unk> in the <unk> election
the two met more than n years ago when <unk> <unk> worked for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> where <unk> <unk> was an organizing director
in <unk> <unk> <unk> also served on a committee of businessmen headed by <unk> <unk> chairman of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
that committee determined to open <unk> to banking across state lines
<unk> <unk> magazine referred to <unk> <unk> this year as one of the <unk> most influential people in the state
the letter to <unk> <unk> was signed by reps . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the chairman of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> a vice chairman of this bank - holding company was named to the additional position of chairman of its principal unit <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> years old will remain president and chief executive officer of the unit
<unk> also named <unk> <unk> <unk> a vice chairman of the parent company and the unit and elected him to the newly created position of chief credit officer of <unk> <unk> increasing the number of corporate board members to <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> was formerly senior executive vice president of the parent company and the unit
<unk> investors <unk> <unk> said n it lowered the debt ratings of certain long - term debt held by this company
the debt - rating concern cited the bank move into the <unk> market noting n its profitability and capital adequacy measurements will be depressed relative to the bank past performance
<unk> also said n it raised its rating on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> now known as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> reflecting the support of other banking affiliates and substantial assistance for the <unk>
officials at the <unk> <unk> bank - holding company were n't available for comment on the debt - rating changes
at <unk> of <unk> underwriters still scratch out policies using fountain pens and blotting paper
visitors are ushered into the premises by red - frocked doormen known as waiters a reminder of the insurance market origins in a coffeehouse in <unk> century <unk>
such trappings suggest a glorious past but give no hint of a troubled present
<unk> once a pillar of the world insurance market is being shaken to its very foundation
the <unk> exchange is battered by enormous claims from a decade - long run of unprecedented disasters the most recent of which is last week earthquake in <unk> <unk> <unk>
at the same time <unk> is besieged by disgruntled investors and hamstrung by inefficient but time - honored ways of conducting business
the exchange is gradually being squeezed into narrow less - profitable segments of the market by less hidebound competitors
<unk> is on the ropes says <unk> <unk> a <unk> investor for n years who now leads a dissident group threatening to sue exchange underwriters for alleged mismanagement and negligence
it needs more discipline
it needs to sort itself out
most troublesome is the shrinking pool of names the well - heeled investors some of them royal who as members of about <unk> syndicates underwrite policies
some n members quit the exchange last year more than triple the number of resignations in <unk>
names are resigning at an even faster pace this year
lackluster returns are one reason
the average after - tax return on investment in <unk> the most recent year for which results are available was <unk> according to <unk> <unk> an insurance consulting firm in <unk>
in <unk> it was <unk>
between <unk> and n the most recent five - year period for which figures are available <unk> reported over n billion in claims and reserves against future losses n billion at today exchange rates more than double the n billion posted in the previous five - year period
many of the <unk> investors who remain are beginning to question one of the exchange most basic tenets the concept of unlimited personal liability
investors may reap huge profits when premiums exceed claims but they are liable to their last pound or dollar in the event of a catastrophe
and catastrophes are getting ever more costly
<unk> claims for the <unk> <unk> <unk> oil - rig disaster in the <unk> <unk> for instance may reach <unk> billion
during the five - year period ended <unk> roughly <unk> of the names had money tied up in money - losing syndicates according to <unk> consultants
the peril of unlimited liability looms large for a number of them now
i have wished <unk> i could die and be out of it that how bad it is <unk> <unk> a secretary from suburban <unk> says
<unk> <unk> whose <unk> membership was a bonus from a former employer in <unk> belongs to <unk> <unk> dissident group on the <unk> syndicate which has been hard hit by asbestos reinsurance claims
<unk> <unk> who underwrote <unk> or about <unk> of insurance coverage on that syndicate now faces potential losses of roughly <unk> or <unk>
if <unk> wants <unk> out of me they will have to take everything <unk> i got and even then i do n't know if it will be enough she says
unease is widespread among exchange members
i ca n't think of any reason n to join <unk> now says <unk> <unk> a british businessman and a <unk> member since <unk>
the downside is very considerable and at the moment the upside is very marginal
if profits do n't improve <unk> <unk> says n he may quit the exchange
meanwhile competition from rivals unencumbered by history is intensifying
<unk> is being squeezed out of low - margin but more consistently profitable product lines such as primary property and marine insurance
over the past decade competitors have chipped away at the exchange share of the <unk> billion marine market in <unk> where half the world ships are insured
<unk> <unk> stake in that market has shrunk to <unk> in that period according to an official at the <unk> of <unk> <unk> a <unk> competitor
the official asked not to be named
much of the business has gone to the institute an association of more than n insurers including <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> has endured decades of genteel decline
at the peak of its power and influence a century ago <unk> dominated the insurance world with a <unk> stake
it virtually dictated how ships were to be built and it monitored commerce through a unrivaled intelligence network in ports around the globe
today <unk> share of the world market excluding life insurance is about <unk>
its stake is even smaller if life insurance is included
bigger rivals such as <unk> and <unk> backed by armies of statisticians using computers in hundreds of branches operate more efficiently and often can offer lower rates brokers say n
<unk> <unk> pioneered such now - standard policies as worker compensation insurance burglary insurance for homeowners and businesses and bankers liability insurance competitors now underwrite most of that business
beyond that many big oil chemical and airline companies are siphoning off big chunks of the market by insuring themselves through captive offshore companies for industry - specific coverage
even <unk> specialty unusually risky ventures is being challenged
only n years ago for instance <unk> was the pre - eminent insurer of thoroughbred horses
but since <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> has grabbed a <unk> stake of the market
<unk> <unk> <unk> says <unk> <unk> has suffered because its structure does n't allow underwriters to deal directly with clients brokers are required intermediaries
thus he asserts <unk> <unk> ca n't react quickly to competition
<unk> has lost control of the situation he says
they are n't controlling their destiny like they used to
<unk> <unk> <unk> chairman agrees <unk> the exchange faces big challenges
this is a watershed time and we are trying to plot our way ahead he says
we have been a great market for inventing risks which other people then take copy and cut rates
<unk> he says <unk> is cut off from the vast body of premium down at the bottom end which acts as a steadying influence against catastrophic losses
by that he means low - margin but low - risk products such as certain types of primary property insurance
the exchange he says n must find new products and new markets
that wo n't be an easy task
tradition is dictator at <unk>
three years ago the exchange took up residence in a space - age tower of steel and glass evocative of the kind of modern architecture that <unk> <unk> <unk> has denounced
some exchange wags call the building the oil rig
but along with such treasured artifacts as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> also brought its outmoded ways of doing business
the <unk> market actively underwrites insurance just n n hours a day brokers say n
underwriting does n't get under way until after morning tea at <unk> a.m
a two - hour lunch break follows
things wind down at about n p.m. just in time for afternoon tea
<unk> vast trading hall houses a warren of well - polished desks
the hall few computers are used mostly to send messages
sandwiched between desks underwriters sit on benches surrounded by stacks of policies
brokers clutching thick folders stand in lines waiting their turn n to speak to the underwriters
a broker may have to approach as many as <unk> underwriters who insure the endeavors on behalf of the syndicates
it could take six months for a claim to be paid
the system says <unk> <unk> - <unk> a <unk> broker who left the exchange in <unk> is so ludicrously unprofessional n it drives you mad
some maintain n underwriters also have been inept
<unk> <unk> a <unk> underwriter says <unk> he and his fellow underwriters underestimated by as much as <unk> the premiums n they should have charged for property risks from <unk> to n
how unprofessional we must have appeared to the outside world how incompetent at risk assessment and evaluation he says
<unk> officials decline to comment on the matter
more recently property rates have increased
many at <unk> expect <unk> the <unk> <unk> earthquake will cause the industry to boost rates even further
but it will be years before it is clear whether higher rates will offset the payouts for such disasters
the magnitude of the exchange problems may not become known for some time because of <unk> practice of leaving the books open for three years to allow for the settlement of claims
<unk> only recently reported its financial results for n
that year it posted record pretax profit of n million a gain n it attributes to higher rates and fewer claims
but <unk> <unk> says <unk> reported profit will be down in <unk> <unk> and n though he declines to specify how steep the decline will be
insurance analysts say n the exchange downturn in profitability is likely to be aggravated by more than n million in aviation losses including the <unk> <unk> <unk> airline disaster over <unk> <unk> and a still - uncalculated chunk of claims from <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> says <unk> the departures of names is n't likely to hurt its underwriting capacity currently about n billion
<unk> <unk> says n the drain of funds has been offset by an increase in investments by the remaining names
meanwhile the exchange has been trying to lower costs
it recently cut its work force by <unk> or <unk>
but <unk> is hampered in its efforts to overhaul operations by its reluctance to embrace modern technology
<unk> <unk> the underwriter reckons <unk> half of his business could be transacted by computer cutting costs at least n
<unk> <unk> has talked for years about computerizing underwriting transactions the effort has n't gotten very far
competition among underwriters and brokers makes them loath to centralize price and policy information
both groups cling to traditional face - to-face dealings even for routine policies
<unk> overblown bureaucracy also hampers efforts to update marketing strategies
some underwriters have been pressing for years to tap the low - margin business by selling some policies directly to consumers
<unk> presently sells only auto insurance directly to the public and such policies are sold only in limited markets such as the <unk> and <unk>
but such changes must be cleared by four internal committees and dozens of underwriters brokers and administrators before being implemented
the proposal to sell directly to the public remains mired in bureaucratic quicksand
<unk> is moving forward on some fronts though
<unk> <unk> says <unk> the exchange is updating some procedures to make speedier payments on claims
by next year all underwriters will be linked to a communications network that could reduce paper work on claims
<unk> <unk> securities <unk> named <unk> <unk> president
<unk> <unk> succeeds <unk> <unk> who will become vice chairman
<unk> <unk> retains his title of chairman of <unk> <unk> second - largest securities firm
in japanese firms the president usually is in charge of day - to-day operations while the chairman role is more a ceremonial one
the title of chief executive officer is n't used
while people within <unk> particularly internationalists expected that <unk> <unk> <unk> would eventually become <unk> president the speed of his promotion surprised many
it was only earlier this year that the jovial easygoing executive he likes to joke with americans about how his name is synonymous with twelve was appointed deputy president
<unk> <unk> is taking over the reins of a securities company that does very well in its domestic market but that is still seeking to realize its potential in global investment banking and securities dealing
<unk> is one of the world largest securities firms
as of <unk> <unk> the <unk> group had shareholder equity of n billion yen n billion
for the six months ended <unk> <unk> <unk> reported unconsolidated parent company net income of n billion yen n million on revenue of n billion yen n billion
both figures were record highs
several observers interpreted <unk> <unk> appointment as an attempt by <unk> to make its international operations more profitable while preparing the firm for the effects of the continuing deregulation of <unk> domestic markets which should mean increased competition
all of <unk> so - called <unk> <unk> securities firms <unk> securities <unk> <unk> the world largest <unk> securities <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> have suffered setbacks in their attempts to break into foreign markets
while they have moved to the fore in underwriting fixed - income securities in the eurobond market mostly for japanese firms they have been only marginally profitable if at all in the <unk>
american institutional investors have never had a large appetite for japanese equities
and while the japanese have stepped up their purchases of <unk> shares in the past several months they have shown themselves in the past to be fickle investors
at the same time <unk> and its brethren have faced stiff competition from well - entrenched american competitors that have prevented them from building strong links to <unk> corporations and institutional investors
<unk> <unk> knows these problems firsthand
when he arrived in the <unk> in <unk> the start of an eight - year tour he tried selling <unk> yen - denominated bonds to <unk> investors
he made desperate efforts using the yellow pages from beginning to end said <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> unit
but not a single piece of paper was sold
by his own account <unk> <unk> did n't do much better with <unk> bonds
in an interview a few months ago he recalled how after some training at <unk> <unk> <unk> he successfully bid for the opportunity to sell portions of <unk> <unk> corporate bond issues
but he could n't sell any
japanese stock salesmen selling american bonds
maybe it crazy he said
<unk> <unk> even related the indignity suffered when he and two colleagues went on an overnight fishing expedition off the <unk> <unk> shore and caught nothing
upon returning to <unk> <unk> <unk> i got into a taxicab and the woman driver said americans make better fishermen he recalled <unk>
undaunted <unk> <unk> said that <unk> goal is to build a high - technology oriented international organization with maybe some japanese flavor to it
he said that he was particularly interested in his firm gaining expertise in futures options mortgaged - backed securities computerized trading and investment systems as well as mergers and acquisitions
<unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> strengths were its large capital base its influential position in the <unk> market and its links to japanese corporations and institutional investors
<unk> <unk> joined <unk> upon his graduation from <unk> <unk> in <unk>
like many young recruits in japanese securities firms he began his career peddling stock to individual investors
in his climb to the top <unk> <unk> also headed the company stock - exchange division its fixed - income units and its international operations
he was constantly picking up new things <unk> to fill out his experience he is very well - balanced said <unk> <unk> chairman of <unk> <unk> unit in <unk> <unk>
but it <unk> <unk> experience as a salesman that enabled him to gain the political support particularly from the retail sales force n to accede to the presidency
<unk> income from domestic stock and bond sales accounts form a large portion of japanese securities companies earnings
and anybody who lacked the backing of the retail sales force would be fragile said <unk> a <unk> executive
if <unk> <unk> has a weakness it may be his golf game
he digs in the sand instead of hitting the ball like a farmer said <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> posted a n decline in third - quarter net income a performance that was in line with analysts expectations
the nickel producer also raised its quarterly dividend to n cents a share from n cents and said n it may buy back as much as <unk> of its common outstanding
<unk> shares fell after the announcements
analysts said n some investors were disappointed that the cash - rich company had failed to announce a special dividend
<unk> closed at <unk> a share down n cents in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> composite trading
some analysts said <unk> <unk> which had cash reserves of n million as of <unk> <unk> could still announce a special dividend in the next few months though it would be smaller than the <unk> special dividend n it paid last year
the quarterly dividend is payable <unk> n to shares of record <unk> n
<unk> net fell to n million or <unk> a share in the third quarter from n million or <unk> a share a year earlier
sales rose <unk> to n million from n million
excluding special gains from tax - loss carry - forwards earnings in the latest quarter were n million or <unk> a share compared with n million or <unk> a share
<unk> said <unk> the drop in earnings resulted mainly from lower nickel prices for the period and a temporary cut in nickel output at the company <unk> operations due to high levels of arsenic in the ore
<unk> said n it plans to buy back as many as five million common shares over the next n months if nickel market conditions are favorable
under a previous buyback program <unk> has purchased n million of its shares since <unk>
<unk> <unk> board quashed any prospects for an immediate revival of a labor - management buy - out saying <unk> <unk> <unk> parent should remain independent for now
as a result <unk> chairman <unk> <unk> <unk> pulled out of the buy - out effort to focus on running the company
the two developments put the acquisition attempt back to square one and leaves the airline with an array of unresolved matters including an unsettled labor situation and a management scrambling to restore its damaged credibility
the effort to create the nation largest employee - owned company began unraveling <unk> n when the labor - management group was unable to obtain financing for its <unk> <unk> billion offer
just last week it suffered another major setback when <unk> <unk> <unk> the largest equity investor in the labor - management bid withdrew its support
takeover stock traders focusing on the company intention to stay independent took the announcement as bad news
<unk> which had risen <unk> to <unk> in composite trading on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on reports of a new bid being prepared by the group reversed course and plummeted in off - exchange trading after the n p.m. <unk> announcement
among the first trades reported by the securities firm of <unk> <unk> which makes a market in <unk> after the exchange is closed were n shares at <unk> <unk> shares at <unk> <unk> at <unk> and <unk> at n
the rebound in <unk> stock during regular trading hours <unk> was its first daily gain after six consecutive losses left the price n below its level before <unk> n the day <unk> the group announced <unk> the bank financing could n't be obtained for the original deal
twelve of <unk> outside directors met at a five - hour meeting yesterday in <unk> to consider an informal proposal from the buy - out group for a revised bid
but the board said <unk> it was n't interested for now
that proposal valued at between <unk> and <unk> a share would have transferred majority ownership to employees while leaving some stock in public hands
the buy - out group had no firm financing for the plan
and with no other offers on the table the board apparently felt no pressure to act on it
the directors signaled however that they would be willing to consider future offers or take some other action to maximize shareholder value saying n they would continue to explore all strategic and financial alternatives
but it was clear that for the time being the board wants the company to return to normalcy
the board said <unk> it concluded that the welfare of the company its shareholders its employees and the broader public can best be enhanced by continued development of <unk> as a strong viable independent company
<unk> <unk> urged all employees to now turn their full attention to operating the airline
he also vowed to make every effort to nurture a constructive new relationship that has been forged with participating employee groups
but <unk> <unk> faces a monumental task in pulling the company back together again
labor problems top the list
for a brief time the buy - out effort seemed to solve his problems with <unk> pilot union
in return for an ownership stake in the company the pilots were willing to agree to a seven - year contract that included a no - strike clause and significant wage concessions and productivity gains n the union previously resisted
that contract was tied to the success of the buy - out
as a good - will measure the pilots had been working four extra hours a month and had agreed to fly <unk> two new <unk> <unk> aircraft
it uncertain if the pilots will continue to do so without a contract settlement
the union said late last night that it is still committed to majority employee ownership and that the labor disputes that faced the company prior to the buy - out effort still need to be addressed
the buy - out effort also worsened already - strained relations between <unk> pilot and machinist unions
the machinists criticisms of the labor - management bid and their threats of a strike unless they received substantial wage increases this year helped cool banks interest in financing the transaction
the machinists previously had shown themselves to be an ally to <unk> <unk> but he lost much of his credibility with that group when he teamed up with the pilot union
the machinists criticized the terms <unk> <unk> <unk> and management received in the buy - out
they paid n million for a <unk> stake and received an additional n of the company at no additional cost
his credibility is also on the line in the investment community
until the collapse of this bid <unk> <unk> was regarded as one of the nation savviest airline executives after engineering turnarounds of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> airlines
but he and his chief financial officer <unk> <unk> sowed some of the seeds for the deal failure by insisting <unk> banks accept low financing fees and interest rates while they invested in the transaction only a small fraction of the <unk> million <unk> they stood to gain from sale of their <unk> stock and options
the board actions leave takeover stock traders nursing some n million in losses and eager to respond to anyone who might make a new offer
it also inevitably leaves a residue of shareholder lawsuits
arbitragers said n they were disappointed n the company did n't announce some recapitalization or other plan to maximize value
one takeover expert noted that arbitragers could force a recapitalization through the written consent process under which holders may oust the board by a majority vote
the machinists union has suggested n it may propose a recapitalization that includes a special dividend for holders and a minority ownership stake for employees
<unk> <unk> investor <unk> <unk> whose n offer for <unk> in <unk> triggered a bidding war says <unk> he remains interested in the airline
however he is restricted from making certain hostile moves by an agreement n he signed to obtain confidential <unk> data
essentially he ca n't make any hostile moves unless he makes a tender offer at least <unk> a share
<unk> <unk> said n it wo n't join <unk> <unk> the group that seeks to battle the japanese in the market for computer memory chips
<unk> decision is a second setback for <unk> <unk>
last month <unk> <unk> <unk> said that it would n't invest in the group
<unk> said that its money would be better spent in areas such as research and development
<unk> <unk> is seeking major investors n to back its attempt to crack the n billion market for dynamic random access memory chips a market dominated by the japanese
those chips were in dire shortage last year hurting many <unk> computer companies that could n't get sufficient <unk> - supplied chips
<unk> said <unk> its experience during the shortage did n't merit the n million to n million investment <unk> <unk> <unk> is seeking from each investor
at this time we elected not to get involved because we have been able to satisfy our need for drams from the market as a rule said <unk> <unk> <unk> director of market planning
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> president said <unk> the decision was disappointing but does n't presage <unk> <unk> failure
i would like to have had them he said
but they were n't on my list of companies who were critical to be a part of it
<unk> <unk> became president and chief executive officer of <unk> <unk> last <unk> when the group was formed by seven electronics companies <unk> <unk> devices <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> machines <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> said <unk> he expects two or three major corporations to announce their participation in <unk> <unk> soon after the group finishes a business plan probably late this week
<unk> <unk> needs a catalyst he said <unk> <unk> to inspire others to join
but so far most potential participants have n't decided
<unk> microsystems <unk> said it still actively evaluating <unk> <unk> and plans to meet with <unk> memories representatives later this week
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> it was waiting to see <unk> <unk> business plan
personal - computer maker <unk> <unk> <unk> said n it is still studying the situation
a <unk> <unk> <unk> spokeswoman said that the company has n't made a decision yet although it is n't under active consideration
in a startling turnabout members of the <unk> <unk> <unk> are complaining that someone in the executive branch is leaking on them
<unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> chairman is upset that someone leaked a letter to the committee from the <unk> administration suggesting that the <unk> would undertake to warn panamanian thug <unk> <unk> if it got wind of an impending coup that might result in his assassination
with due respect to highly classified correspondence and other buzzwords the leakers are performing a public service
if the <unk> has become a protection service for <unk> <unk> the american people ought to know
what went wrong in <unk> is a fitting subject for public and congressional inquiry
naturally <unk> <unk> and his committee would like free rein n to blame the executive branch while stamping top secret on their own complicity
but there no danger of exposing sources and methods in disclosing the debate running up and down <unk> <unk>
and if <unk> is going to assume authority to micromanage foreign policy it going to have to take some of the responsibility too
the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> urged the panamanian armed forces to move against <unk> <unk>
when they did his commanders did n't have the initiative n to do more than block a couple of roads
the executive branch bears the first responsibility for timidity
but what kind of initiative can you expect given the climate set by <unk>
for example what exactly did the <unk> tell <unk> <unk> and his fellow coup plotters about <unk> laws and executive orders on assassinations
what part did <unk> warnings play in the major unwillingness to pull the trigger when he had <unk> <unk> in custody but was under attack by pro - <unk> troops
<unk> <unk> did n't suffer from any hesitation once he had the pistol
maybe we need a <unk> version of the <unk> warning you have the right to conceal your coup intentions because we may rat on you
or maybe a <unk> <unk> warning <unk> in the <unk> <unk> may be fatal
<unk> chief <unk> <unk> hardly a <unk> malcontent got the debate started last week by noting that the executive order banning assassinations had contributed to <unk> paralysis during the coup
the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> tried to smooth things over a few days later but instead simply underlined <unk> <unk> point
the interpretation of the executive order <unk> <unk> said <unk> and the way in which the various committees have over time interpreted it has led in my view to a proper caution on the part of operators including me
in other words <unk> wo n't let the <unk> do much of anything anymore and that fine with the <unk>
the pay the same and the duty lighter
and of course doing anything that might be second - guessed by <unk> carries heavy penalties
witness the <unk> prosecution of <unk> <unk>
the <unk> <unk> ranking republican <unk> <unk> <unk> joined with <unk> <unk> <unk> to write a best seller about <unk> - <unk> deploring men of <unk>
no doubt many people in the <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> have read it
what kind of initiative should anyone expect from people out on the line who read all this and know what can happen if they fail
who wants to end up as the protagonist in a <unk> <unk> morality play
the order against assassinations is another artifact of the same congressional mind - set a product of the <unk> <unk> syndrome against any executive action
<unk> <unk> would do himself and the country a favor by rescinding the order as an ambiguous intrusion on his ability to defend <unk> national security
there are of course good reasons n the <unk> should n't get into the assassination business but rescinding the executive order is not the same thing as saying <unk> the <unk> should start passing out exploding cigars
the world being the nasty place n it is we want presidents to have the freedom n to order operations in which someone might get killed
in such situations you can not write rules in advance you can only make sure n the <unk> takes the responsibility
the executive order and the reported agreements with the <unk> <unk> are neither sensible nor moral
as it now stands the <unk> can bomb <unk> but ca n't assassinate <unk> <unk>
it can send a fighter squadron to strafe terrorist hideouts in the <unk> <unk> but ca n't shoot <unk> <unk>
both the assassination order and the quality of debate in <unk> are telling the world that the only way n the <unk> will kill a madman is by making sure n we take some innocent civilians with him
we heard <unk> property - tax-cutting <unk> <unk> blamed for a lot over the years but <unk> <unk> <unk> came up with a new wrinkle in his earthquake coverage last week when he asked <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> if <unk> . n had withheld money needed for road maintenance
<unk> <unk> happily agreed sliding over the fact that <unk> roads and bridges are n't funded by property taxes but by state and federal gasoline taxes
both have been raised at least n in recent years even while the price of gasoline has fallen
dragging <unk> . n into this story is a pretty long stretch
a series of explosions tore through the huge <unk> <unk> <unk> plastics plant near here injuring more than a hundred and closing parts of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
there were no immediate reports of deaths but officials said n a number of workers were still unaccounted for last night

an <unk> official said that at this time the oil company does n't anticipate any additional charges to future earnings relating to the cleanup of oil spilled when one of its tankers rammed into an underwater reef

both executives left the company after clashes with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> which is based here will use part of the proceeds to pay down debt associated with its purchase of the <unk> <unk> <unk> for n million in <unk>
the <unk> <unk> paper like the <unk> <unk> <unk> paper was purchased by <unk> on <unk> behalf as part of the management contract
industry analysts have said that the purchase price for the paper was too high causing a strain on <unk> finances
investment bankers familiar with the company said <unk> <unk> is seeking a new bank credit line of n million and may have to sell additional newspapers
<unk> <unk> <unk> president and chief operating officer of <unk> said in a telephone interview that the company does n't currently have any plans to sell additional newspapers
<unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> former president of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> former senior vice president would head the new in - house management team at <unk> which had revenue of n million in <unk>
the association between the two companies stretches back thirty years to a friendship between television producer <unk> <unk> and <unk> founder <unk> <unk>
the latter son <unk> <unk> <unk> took over the company and has been managing the <unk> properties and acting as an agent in the purchase of newspapers for <unk>
but in recent years <unk> <unk> began focusing more on expanding his own newspaper empire in partnership with investment banking firm <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> has n dailies and n other non - daily papers in the <unk> and <unk>
the company said <unk> its revenue will exceed n million this year
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said in a statement that the company is delighted by the conclusion of the <unk> relationship and will be able to concentrate all our energies on <unk> own papers
<unk> <unk> in his own statement was less upbeat saying unfortunately over the past few years it has become increasingly clear that <unk> and i have different agendas and that he feels more comfortable with a management team whose sole interest and responsibility is in the <unk> papers
just five months after <unk> <unk> was swallowed up in an unsolicited takeover <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman and chief executive officer said <unk> he is leaving to take a top post at <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> n years old abruptly announced <unk> he will leave the venerable ad agency whose largest client is <unk> <unk> to become <unk> <unk> executive vice president for corporate affairs and communications
he will succeed <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who has said <unk> he will retire in <unk>
<unk> <unk> said in <unk> that he would retire by the end of this year to take executive responsibility for an embarrassing effort to discredit banker <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> representatives apparently influenced the publication of unfavorable articles about <unk> <unk>
the company later apologized and agreed to make n million in contributions to charities chosen by him
although <unk> <unk> is retiring he will continue to work as a consultant for <unk> <unk> on a project basis
ad industry executives were n't surprised by <unk> <unk> decision to leave <unk>
the agency under his direction bitterly fought a takeover attempt by <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> before succumbing in <unk>
and although <unk> <unk> and <unk> chief executive <unk> <unk> have gone out of their way to be publicly supportive of each other people close to <unk> <unk> say <unk> he was unhappy giving up control of the company
some executives also cite tension because of efforts by <unk> <unk> a financial man to cut costs at the agency
<unk> <unk> will be succeeded as the head of <unk> flagship ad agency <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> who had been president of north american operations and who like <unk> <unk> is british
<unk> <unk> <unk> will take on the newly created position of president of the world - wide agency and chief executive of its international operations
he had been president of the international operations
<unk> <unk> also had overseen <unk> <unk> two other units the <unk> <unk> <unk> advertising agency and its research division but those units will now report directly to <unk>
<unk> <unk> appears custom - made for the <unk> <unk> job
known as a traditional executive he is very much in the conservative <unk> <unk> mold
moreover after n years at <unk> he had honed a reputation for being squeaky - clean and a straight arrow which can only help <unk> <unk> in the wake of the <unk> incident
he also is close to <unk> <unk> chairman and chief executive officer <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
aside from working with <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> advertising account for about n years <unk> <unk> serves on several of the same charities and boards as <unk> <unk>
the abrupt management change sparked widespread speculation that <unk> <unk> had been pushed out of <unk> top spot by <unk> <unk>
but <unk> <unk> flatly denied the speculation saying <unk> <unk> <unk> had tried several times to persuade him to stay offering various incentives and in one instance sending a note with a case of wine the wine naturally was <unk> brand an <unk> client
he asked me not to resign
the implication that i was pushed aside would n't be accurate <unk> <unk> said
<unk> <unk> traveling in the <unk> <unk> could n't be reached
<unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> first approached him about the job in late <unk>
according to industry executives <unk> <unk> a former <unk> <unk> commissioner from <unk> was also a serious contender for the <unk> <unk> job
although it ultimately was n't offered to him he will be on retainer to <unk> <unk> as an adviser on international matters
after talking on and off for the past four weeks <unk> <unk> said <unk> he agreed to take the job because it the right time it a terrific opportunity and i think n i leave the company in very strong hands
it was my decision not anyone else
<unk> <unk> also brushed aside reports about infighting between him and <unk> <unk> his successor at <unk>
the two executives could hardly be more different
<unk> <unk> comes across as a low - key executive <unk> <unk> has a flashier personality
during time off <unk> <unk> tends to his garden <unk> <unk> confesses to a fondness for among other things fast cars and planes
industry executives say that although the two executives used to clash more frequently the <unk> takeover brought them closer together
i the guy who made him head of <unk> <unk> head of the <unk> president of <unk> <unk> and recommended him to <unk> <unk> as my successor
would i have done all those things successively if i did n't think <unk> he was the right guy <unk> <unk> asked
he labeled reports of friction ridiculous and said that he spent part of the weekend on <unk> <unk> boat in <unk>
<unk> <unk> will oversee <unk> <unk> public relations and government affairs among other things but he wo n't be involved in its advertising which is handled by the operating units
i consider this a second career he said
he also will sit on the company corporate planning and policy committee made up of the top corporate and operating executives
<unk> <unk> departure is n't expected to have any enormous repercussions at <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> foods and <unk> executives said n the move wo n't affect their relationships with the ad agency
<unk> foods relationships with its agencies are based on the agencies work and will continue to be said <unk> <unk> a vice president of <unk> <unk> foods
but some clients and analysts expressed concern that <unk> <unk> is n't as well - known to many clients
<unk> was my key contact said <unk> <unk> <unk> president and chief executive officer of <unk> <unk> which represents cotton producers
i do n't know <unk> <unk> all that well
i have n't seen or talked to him in several years
and some analysts questioned whether <unk> <unk> would have the skills <unk> <unk> needs to turn the agency around
while the agency has done well in many parts of the world its flagship <unk> <unk> office has had a dismal track record recently it has won few new accounts while losing big ones including <unk> <unk>
i think <unk> <unk> <unk> is going to need some help
i think n they need creative leadership and i do n't think n they have it said <unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> top creative executive <unk> <unk> left the agency earlier this year
<unk> <unk> was a creative inspiration at the company and nobody has filled that void said <unk> <unk>
but other analysts said that having <unk> <unk> succeed <unk> <unk> would make for a smooth transition
<unk> <unk> has been there a long time knows the culture well is aggressive and apparently gets along well with <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk> <unk>
it probably a reasonable transition
hopefully he be the answer to the problems <unk> they had in <unk> <unk>
sale of <unk> <unk>
<unk> sciences <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said n it is close to making final an agreement to buy <unk> <unk> associates from <unk>
<unk> sciences would n't disclose the proposed purchase price for <unk> <unk> which counsels companies on logistics and supply
but <unk> <unk> managing editor of <unk> <unk> an industry publication based in <unk> <unk> said n an industry standard would suggest a purchase price of between one and two times <unk> <unk> approximately n million annual revenue
both <unk> <unk> which announced its intention to sell off most of its consulting business in <unk> and <unk> <unk> declined to comment on the proposed sale
ad notes

<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> awarded its n million account to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> office in <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
<unk> - <unk> <unk> yesterday said n singer <unk> <unk> signed to appear in an ad for <unk> <unk>
details of the commercial which will be part of the brand n advertising campaign were n't disclosed
<unk> <unk> becomes the latest of many music stars including <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> to appear in ads for the diet drink
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said n it formed a unit n to make and distribute movies to theaters overseas and eventually to <unk> theaters too
the operator of cable - television networks said <unk> the new <unk> <unk> unit will produce movies that will premiere on <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> channel or <unk> and then will be released internationally in movie theaters
the unit first two offerings are slated to be the <unk> life of <unk> <unk> a dramatization about the former british spy who wrote the <unk> <unk> novels and <unk> <unk> produced by <unk> <unk> who also stars in the movie
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman was named chairman of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> <unk> was named president of the unit
in an interview <unk> <unk> said <unk> the subsidiary primary mission will be to make movies for <unk> and to distribute them internationally
but he said <unk> <unk> <unk> already has found some ideas that might work well as films for theatrical release in the <unk>
when that occurs and when the time is right we release the films in the <unk> he said adding that <unk> <unk> may develop such movies next year for domestic release in <unk>
<unk> has made several movies docudramas and documentaries for its networks in recent years but the company has never acted as a full - fledged movie studio and released its own pictures to theaters
<unk> <unk> said <unk> the <unk> life of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> cost more than n million each to make which is only about one - third the cost of most movies made for theatrical release
the <unk> move is in line with a cable - tv trend toward more original programming and toward finding more ways <unk> to amortize the high cost of producing films
in <unk> <unk> <unk> formed <unk> <unk> <unk> to produce n low - budget movies a year that will premiere on <unk> network and be distributed later in various markets including foreign theaters
in a sign n the stock slump has n't quieted <unk> takeover fever <unk> <unk> de <unk> said n it intends to bid for one of <unk> other large financial and industrial holding companies <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> said that once it receives the go - ahead from french stock market authorities it will offer to boost its <unk> <unk> stake to <unk> from the current n
its cash - or-shares bid values <unk> <unk> at about n billion francs n billion making this one of <unk> largest - ever attempted takeovers
the cost of buying the additional <unk> stake would be n billion francs n billion
the move would greatly boost <unk> stake in the insurance transport and food businesses where <unk> <unk> is strong
it also would make <unk> a major french ally of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> insurance group
<unk> holds a <unk> stake in <unk> <unk> insurance interests acquired three weeks ago
those include <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
long considered a potential takeover target <unk> <unk> had hoped <unk> <unk> would help protect it from raiders
that idea may have backfired
<unk> is <unk> main french bank and the <unk> - based group said <unk> it intends to stay neutral
<unk> <unk> said n it would n't have any comment until its board meets <unk>
but <unk> <unk> is loosely held and hard n to defend
the defensive options are limited says <unk> <unk> a partner in portfolio management concern <unk> <unk> <unk>
who would bid against <unk>
if the <unk> bid succeeds it will be the second time in two months n a big french investment banking group has snapped up an insurance group
last month <unk> archrival <unk> <unk> de <unk> won a battle for <unk> <unk> <unk> second - largest private - sector insurer which itself had just acquired <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
that complex bid was billed as <unk> largest takeover ever this one is slightly smaller
moreover <unk> had just finished winning an even larger battle last year for control of <unk> <unk> de <unk>
<unk> officials once considered <unk> toughest bankers felt abashed at <unk> success and its rapid growth
although <unk> denies it analysts say n the new bid in part simply reflects the continuing rivalry between <unk> two largest investment banking groups
it also reflects the broader pressure on companies in <unk> to keep up as the <unk> <unk> prepares to reduce internal trade barriers by n
although <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> - <unk> would n't rule out eventually selling all of <unk> <unk> insurance operations to <unk> he stressed the potential for the two groups instead to cooperate
he also told reporters n the acquisition would give <unk> fresh diversity bringing it properties in food and transport where it has been weak
<unk> <unk> has investments in a sugar company a food and canning concern a bakery and bus and trucking firms among others
and <unk> <unk> has a huge hidden attraction
payment by <unk> for the insurance interests n it has just bought will help swell the french concern treasury to an estimated n billion francs
<unk> said n it will bid n francs a share for <unk> <unk> shares that qualify for a full yearly dividend and <unk> francs for those created <unk> <unk> which are eligible for partial dividends
alternatively it said n it would offer three <unk> shares themselves eligible for dividends as of next <unk> n for one <unk> <unk> share
<unk> shares closed down n francs at n francs and <unk> <unk> shares were suspended at <unk> francs pending the outcome of the bid
<unk> said n it would publish details of its bid once authorities clear it
this is one of the first bids under new takeover rules aimed at encouraging open bids instead of gradual accumulation of large stakes
some financial sources said privately that <unk> blundered in failing to move sooner for the insurance and industrial group bidding only after speculation had pushed up the price
<unk> <unk> - <unk> responded that his group initially intended to take only a minority stake striking an alliance with current management
when notoriously independent - minded <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> rejected <unk> offer and began buying <unk> shares in retaliation <unk> <unk> - <unk> said <unk> he felt obliged to bid for control
he told reporters <unk> he had information that <unk> <unk> was preparing to buy as much as <unk> of <unk> up from less than <unk> currently
a bid against <unk> could n't be ruled out
<unk> second - largest government - owned insurance company <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has been building its own <unk> <unk> stake currently thought to be between <unk> and <unk>
analysts said n they do n't think n it is contemplating a takeover however and its officials could n't be reached
crude oil futures prices fell further as analysts and traders said <unk> <unk> oil producers are n't putting the brakes on output ahead of the traditionally weak first quarter
in trading on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> benchmark <unk> <unk> <unk> crude fell n cents a barrel to <unk> for <unk> delivery
petroleum products prices also declined
analysts pointed to reports that the <unk> of <unk> <unk> countries is producing substantially more than its official limit of n million barrels a day with some accounts putting the n group output as high as n million barrels a day
that level of production did n't take its toll on futures prices for the fourth quarter when demand is traditionally strong
but because first - quarter demand is normally the weakest of the year several market participants say n <unk> production will have to decline to keep prices from eroding further
the group plans to meet in a month to discuss production strategy for early n
with prices already headed lower news of a series of explosions at a major <unk> <unk> <unk> chemical facility on the <unk> <unk> <unk> also was bearish for prices
even though such facilities use a relatively small amount of crude analysts say n now the facility wo n't need any at a time of already high availability
the <unk> plant makes polyethylene polypropylene and other plastic products
a company official said <unk> the explosions began when a seal blew out
dozens of workers were injured authorities said <unk>
there was no immediate estimate of damage from the company
some petroleum futures traders say n technical considerations now will help to put downward pressure on futures prices
for instance one trader said that prices inevitably will go lower now that they fallen below <unk> a barrel
our technician is a little bearish now that we taken out <unk> he said
in other commodity markets yesterday
copper
the selling that started on <unk> continued yesterday
the <unk> contract fell n cents a pound to n
<unk> <unk> <unk> warehouse stocks were down only <unk> metric tons for the week to <unk> tons expectations late last week were a drop of <unk> to <unk> tons
the <unk> <unk> market made its high for the day on the opening and when it dropped below the <unk> level selling picked up as previous buyers bailed out of their positions and aggressive short sellers anticipating further declines moved in
fund selling also picked up at that point
according to <unk> <unk> senior commodity analyst at <unk> the only stability to the market came when short sellers periodically moved in to cover their positions by buying contracts
this activity produced small rallies which in turn attracted new short selling
<unk> <unk> noted that copper had a steep fall in spite of a weak dollar which would normally support the <unk> copper market
such support usually comes from arbitragers who use a strong british pound to buy copper in <unk> <unk>
the sell - off would probably have been worse if the dollar had been strong he said
copper has been stuck in a trading range of <unk> to n
<unk> <unk> believes that if copper falls below the bottom of this range the next significant support level will be about <unk>
precious metals
platinum and palladium struggled to maintain their prices all day despite news stories over the weekend that recent cold fusion experiments which use both metals showed signs of producing extra heat
<unk> platinum closed down n an ounce at <unk> nearly n above its low for the day
<unk> palladium was off n an ounce at <unk>
platinum is believed to have good support around <unk> and palladium at around <unk>
some traders were thought to be waiting for the auto sales report which will be released today
such sales are watched closely by platinum and palladium traders because both metals are used in automobile catalytic converters
<unk> <unk> theorized that the news on cold fusion did n't affect the market yesterday because many traders have already been badly burnt by such stories
he said n the traders are demanding a higher level of proof before they will buy palladium again
also weighing on both metals prices is the role of the chief supplier the <unk> <unk>
many analysts believe that the soviets thirst for dollars this year n to buy grain and other western commodities and goods will bring them to the market whenever prices rally very much
grains and soybeans
prices closed mixed as contracts reacted to largely offsetting bullish and bearish news
on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> soybeans for <unk> delivery closed at <unk> a bushel down half a cent while the <unk> wheat contract rose three - quarters of a cent to n a bushel
supporting prices was the announcement late <unk> of additional grain sales to the <unk> <unk>
but acting as a drag on prices was the improved harvest weather over the weekend and the prospect for continued fair weather this week over much of the <unk> <unk>
strong farmer selling over the weekend also weighed on prices
sugar
world prices tumbled mostly from their own weight according to analysts
the <unk> contract ended at n cents a pound down n cent
for the past week or so traders have been expecting <unk> to buy between <unk> and <unk> tons of refined sugar and there have been expectations of a major purchase by <unk>
but with no reports of either country actually entering the market analysts said n futures prices became vulnerable
developing countries such as <unk> some analysts said seem to have made it a point to stay away whenever sugar reached the top of its trading range around n cents and wait for prices to return to the bottom of the range around <unk> cents
but <unk> <unk> a sugar analyst with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> the explanation for the latest drop in sugar prices is much simpler speculators he said n got too long too soon and ran into resistance around the old contract highs
a <unk> analyst said that in light of a new estimate of a production increase of four million metric tons and only a modest increase in consumption sugar is n't likely to rise above the top of its trading range without a crop problem in a major producing country
cocoa
futures rallied modestly
the <unk> contract rose <unk> a metric ton to <unk> near its high for the day
<unk> <unk> <unk> a british cocoa - trading house estimated that the n world cocoa surplus would be n tons down from <unk> tons for the previous year
market technicians were encouraged by the price patterns which in the past have preceded sharp rallies
recent prices for cocoa have been near levels last seen in the n
at such prices according to <unk> <unk> bargain hunting and short - covering buying back of contracts previously sold by speculators is n't uncommon
but <unk> <unk> expects stepped - up producer selling at around the <unk> to <unk> level
he also noted that a strong sterling market yesterday might have helped cocoa in <unk> <unk> as arbitragers took advantage of the currency move
<unk> <unk> research analyst at <unk> <unk> <unk> said n the market pushed higher mainly in anticipation of a late harvest in the <unk> <unk> a major cocoa producer
<unk> <unk> <unk> bought out <unk> <unk> interest in <unk> - <unk> a joint venture of the two companies based in <unk>
the price was n billion yen n million
the agreement provides that <unk> <unk> will remain a supplier to <unk> - <unk> which makes printing presses for the newspaper industry

the bond market which sometimes thrives on bad news cheered yesterday stock market sell - off and perceptions that the economy is growing weaker
early in the day bonds rose modestly on economists forecasts that this week slate of economic data will portray an economy headed for trouble
such news is good for bonds because economic weakness sometimes causes the <unk> <unk> to lower interest rates in an effort to stimulate the economy and stave off a recession
for example today the <unk> of <unk> is scheduled to release the <unk> durable goods report
the consensus forecast of n economists surveyed by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is for a <unk> drop in <unk> orders
that would follow a n advance in <unk>
bonds received a bigger boost later in the day when stock prices moved broadly lower
the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> fell n points to <unk>
bond investors have been watching stocks closely said <unk> <unk> chief fixed - income analyst at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
when you get a big sell - off in equities money starts to shift into bonds which are considered safer he said n

municipals ended mixed while mortgage - backed and investment - grade corporate bonds rose
prices of high - yield high - risk corporate securities ended unchanged
in more evidence of the growing division between good and bad junk bonds a n million issue by <unk> <unk> <unk> was snapped up by investors while underwriters for <unk> <unk> n million issue are considering restructuring the deal to attract buyers
in the <unk> market analysts expect bond prices to trade in narrow ranges this week as the market takes in positive and negative news
on the negative side the market will be affected by constant supply in all sectors of the market said <unk> <unk> <unk> economist at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
on the other hand we have economic news that is expected to be relatively positive for the bond market
we will go back and forth with a tilt toward slightly lower yields he said
today the <unk> will sell n billion of new two - year notes
tomorrow <unk> <unk> <unk> a division of a new government agency created to bail out the nation troubled thrifts will hold its first bond auction at which it will sell n billion of <unk> bonds
so far money managers and other bond buyers have n't shown much interest in the <unk> bonds
analysts have mixed views about the two - year note auction
while some say n the auction should proceed smoothly others contend that yesterday sale of <unk> billion of asset - backed securities by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> may have siphoned some potential institutional buyers from the government note sale
the division of auto maker <unk> <unk> <unk> made its debut in the asset - backed securities market with the second - largest issue in the market four - year history
the company offered securities backed by automobile loans through an underwriting group headed by <unk> <unk> <unk>
the issue yields <unk> and carries a guarantee covering n of the deal from the company
<unk> <unk> sweetened the terms from the original yield estimate in an apparent effort to place the huge offering
the issue was offered at a yield nearly one percentage point above the yield on two - year treasurys
the only asset - backed deal larger than <unk> was a <unk> billion offering by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>
<unk>
<unk> bonds were <unk> to n point higher yesterday in light trading
the benchmark <unk> bond ended at a price of <unk> <unk> compared with <unk> <unk> <unk>

the <unk> billion of six - month <unk> bills were sold with an average discount rate of <unk> the highest since the average of n at the <unk> n auction
the rates were up from last week auction when they were <unk> and <unk> respectively
here are auction details
rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value
thus higher bidding narrows the investor return while lower bidding widens it
the percentage rates are calculated on a <unk> year while the coupon - equivalent yield is based on a <unk> year
both issues are dated <unk> n
the n bills mature <unk> n <unk> and the n bills mature <unk> n n

in the junk bond market <unk> industries issue of <unk> debentures considered to be one of the market high - quality credits was priced at par to yield n
<unk> <unk> managing director at underwriter <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> the issue was oversubscribed
it a segmented market and if you have a good strong credit people have an appetite for it he said
<unk> <unk> is expected to price another junk bond deal n million of senior subordinated debentures by <unk> <unk> <unk> next <unk>
in light of the recent skittishness in the high - yield market junk bond analysts and traders expect other high - yield deals to be sweetened or restructured before they are offered to investors
in the case of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is considering restructuring the reset mechanism on the n million portion of the offering
under the originally contemplated terms of the offering the notes would have been reset annually at a fixed spread above treasurys

mortgage - backed
activity in derivative markets was strong with four new real estate mortgage investment conduits announced and talk of several more deals in today session
the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> offered <unk> billion of <unk> securities in three issues and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> offered a n million <unk> backed by <unk> <unk> securities
part of the reason for the heavy activity in derivative markets is that underwriters are repackaging mortgage securities being sold by thrifts
traders said n thrifts have stepped up their mortgage securities sales as the bond market has risen in the past two weeks
in the mortgage pass - through sector active issues rose but trailed gains in the <unk> market
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> securities for <unk> delivery were quoted late yesterday at <unk> <unk> up <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> securities were at <unk> <unk> up <unk>
the <unk> <unk> <unk> issue was yielding <unk> to a n average life assumption as the spread above the <unk> <unk> note widened slightly to n percentage points
a n million <unk> <unk> <unk> electric and gas system revenue bond issue dominated the new issue sector
the refunding issue which had been in the wings for two months was one of the chief offerings overhanging the market and limiting price appreciation
but alleviating that overhang failed to stimulate much activity in the secondary market where prices were off <unk> to up <unk> point
an official with lead underwriter <unk> <unk> said n orders for the <unk> <unk> bonds were on the slow side
he attributed that to the issue aggressive pricing and large size as well as the general lethargy in the municipal marketplace
in addition he noted n the issue would normally be the type purchased by property and casualty insurers but recent disasters such as <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> earthquake have stretched insurers resources and damped their demand for bonds

the husky blond guide with the <unk> cap twists his face in mock fury
i got to get back to school and straighten out my <unk>
he has two more years at <unk> <unk>
right now he takes people out to fish in the bays behind the barrier islands that curve for hundreds of miles along the eastern coast of <unk> enclosing milky green lagoons behind ridges of sand and grassy scrub that rim the deep blue of the <unk> beyond
there have been three days of hot wind - swept rain and now with the first sun we are after speckled seatrout which with redfish provides most of the game fishing hereabouts
the little radio fizzes as other boats want to see if we have found any fish spotting location is everything in this sport
negative answers crackle back
the fish often are plentiful around the pilings of the old gas wells that dot the flat surface like the remains of sunken ships
we go from one to the other
the sun is hot now though it only n in the morning
the great silver clouds on the horizon build themselves on the pale water
we cruise toward another set of pilings
the guide scoops into a pail and puts a frantically wiggling croaker on the hook
then he casts out
just wait for that tap - tap that thump - thump
it comes real gentle before it pulls
do n't forget <unk> trout have very soft mouths
the radio queries again
pickin one or two says the guide chuckling
you can tell n they got nothin

the text by <unk> <unk> is a tough read but the pictures make her magnetism clear and help explain why <unk> <unk> called <unk> the most sensational woman <unk> anybody ever saw
or ever will
<unk> <unk> is foreign editor of the <unk>
<unk> having rid itself of asbestos now sells fiberglass forest products minerals and industrial goods
<unk> stuff it not
but <unk> ownership is unusual and it has caught the eye of some canny and patient investors
the <unk> - based concern which emerged from bankruptcy - law proceedings late last year is controlled by the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the trust which owns n of <unk> stock on a fully diluted basis is a separate legal entity that is settling claims with asbestos victims
when and if the trust runs out of cash which seems increasingly likely it will need to convert its <unk> stock to cash
but as an n owner if it tried to sell much of its stock in the market it would likely depress the price of its shares
some investors say n there is a good chance that the trust will instead seek to convert the company shares to cash in some sort of friendly restructuring that would n't involve just dumping stock on the market
their principal asset is <unk> common stock says <unk> <unk> who runs <unk> associates an investment fund that owns <unk> shares
if they tried to sell they be chasing their own tail
what makes the most sense is to find someone who wants to buy the whole company or cause a recapitalization of all shares
the trust is n't commenting on when it might need to liquefy its <unk> stock
however the trust cash flow from investments is far short of its payments to asbestos victims
its cash and liquid securities fell by n million in the first six months of <unk>
the trust also will receive n million a year starting in <unk> on a bond n it holds from <unk>
and beginning in <unk> it will have a claim on as much as <unk> of <unk> annual net income
even so the trust would seem to be facing a cash crunch
as of <unk> <unk> it had settled only about n of the <unk> received claims from asbestos victims for an average of <unk> each
the average should drop over time since the most expensive claims are being settled first
and as of midyear settled but unpaid claims amounted to n million more than half the trust total of n million in cash and marketable securities
at some point we going to need an infusion of funds a person close to the trust says
even before then the trust may be eager to unload <unk> stock
it does n't pay a dividend and this trust needs income
moreover with <unk> of its assets tied up in <unk> the trust is badly in need of diversification
obviously a diversified portfolio would have less risk the person close to the trust says
<unk> itself does n't rule out a restructuring
though the ink is barely dry on its new post - bankruptcy law structure <unk> <unk> <unk> head of investor relations says <unk> the company is continually pondering whether there is a better way n to be structured
we understand that the trust is ultimately going to need to sell some of our shares he says
of course one option would be for <unk> to buy out the trust shares which would do little to benefit public stockholders
but the trust in most cases is forbidden from seeking a buyer for only its shares before <unk> n
and both the trust and <unk> are seeking to avoid the bad publicity that in the asbestos era tarred the <unk> name
thus analysts say n the trust is unlikely to do anything that would hurt <unk> other shareholders
this is a rare case of a company with a big majority holder which will probably act in the interests of the minority holders one investor says
even if there is no restructuring <unk> seems to be attractive long - term
its stock at <unk> n trades at about n n times estimated n earnings an appropriately low multiple for a company with recession - sensitive customers

<unk> bought a <unk> stake in <unk> <unk> <unk> last year and <unk> <unk> later purchased about a <unk> stake they would have interests in the new realty company in line with their holdings in <unk> <unk> <unk>
the sale and spinoff of the real estate unit is the first phase of what could lead to the breakup of <unk> <unk> <unk> into free - standing companies for its railroad and energy operations as well as real estate
the debt - laden parent has been under pressure from large shareholders to boost the company share price
at the same time it has been caught in an earnings squeeze
the <unk> pension fund planned investment in the real estate unit is unusual
pension funds rarely own as much as a <unk> stake in what is expected to be a publicly traded company
in addition pension funds are rarely given seats on company boards and most often try to avoid them because of legal concerns
but fund officials said <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> investment provides an opportunity to buy a stake in a large real estate portfolio heavily weighted with <unk> properties
it also marks a major commitment to real estate development which we have n't been involved with before said <unk> <unk> <unk> the fund executive director
under the proposed plan the fund would also lend <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> n million in the form of a note that would be convertible into additional shares of the realty company after the second year at the then - prevailing market price
the note would accrue interest at the rate of <unk> a year which would be payable to the fund after five years according to <unk> <unk> <unk> a real estate consultant working for the fund
the purpose of the note is to provide added capital for the spun - off company in a form that will save it spending cash on immediate interest payments <unk> <unk> said <unk>
the spun - off concern clearly will be one of the dominant real estate development companies with a prime portfolio he said n
for the last year <unk> <unk> <unk> has redirected its real estate operations toward longer - term development of its properties hurting profits that the parent had generated in the past from periodic sales from its portfolio
real estate operating income for the first nine months fell to n million from n million a year earlier the company said n
in a statement late yesterday <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman <unk> <unk> <unk> said that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> would repay more than n million in debt owed to the parent before the planned spinoff
that would help reduce <unk> <unk> <unk> remaining debt to about n million from a high of n billion in early n
it was n't clear where <unk> <unk> <unk> expected to obtain the payment of more than n million which would be well above the n million that <unk> pension fund officials say n they plan to provide
the realty unit might take on new debt or obtain additional investors among other possibilities
the <unk> <unk> <unk> spokesman declined to comment on that aspect saying n the deal was still under negotiation
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> owns n million acres of property including n buildings with more than n million square feet of space
it also holds nearly n acres of raw land with development potential but under a previously announced strategy the company has targeted building on <unk> acres in <unk> <unk> and the <unk> area
among those are the <unk> acres in the <unk> <unk> <unk> area including n acres in the <unk> <unk> area
the <unk> pension fund which has n billion already invested in real estate and mortgages could be a valuable funding source for that development although it is n't obliged to make further investments
the fund is the nation largest public employee fund and it has a growing cash flow now topping n billion a year
fund officials negotiated the final structure of the proposed deal with <unk> <unk> <unk> but they were approached with the idea by real estate brokers <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>
<unk> officials are expected to be hired to represent the pension fund on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> board <unk> <unk> said n to insulate the fund from potential liability problems
<unk> <unk> <unk> is scheduled to begin today
after two mistrials the stakes in the stock manipulation trial of <unk> <unk> and its vice chairman <unk> <unk> <unk> have changed considerably
the first two <unk> trials were watched closely on <unk> <unk> because they were considered to be important tests of the government ability to convince a jury of allegations stemming from its insider - trading investigations
in an eight - count indictment the government charged <unk> a <unk> <unk> chemical maker and <unk> <unk> with illegally attempting to manipulate the common stock of <unk> <unk> <unk> in advance of <unk> planned sale of a large block of the stock in <unk>
the government credibility in the <unk> case depended heavily on its star witness <unk> <unk> <unk> the former <unk> <unk> brokerage chief who was implicated by former arbitrager <unk> <unk> and then pointed the finger at <unk> <unk> takeover speculator <unk> <unk> <unk> and corporate raider <unk> <unk>
the <unk> trials were viewed as previews of the government strength in its cases against <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> performance as a witness was expected to affect his sentencing
but <unk> bellwether role was short - lived
the first <unk> trial ended in a mistrial after four weeks when <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> found that a prosecutor improperly but unintentionally withheld a document
after n hours of deliberation the jurors in the second trial said n they were hopelessly deadlocked and another mistrial was declared on <unk> <unk>
meanwhile a federal jury found <unk> <unk> guilty on securities fraud and other charges in <unk>
a month later <unk> <unk> was spared a jail term by a federal judge who praised him for helping the government
in <unk> <unk> <unk> pleaded guilty to three felony counts
nevertheless the stakes are still high for the players directly involved in the <unk> case
the mistrials have left the reputations of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in limbo
for <unk> <unk> a conviction could carry penalties of five years in prison and a n fine on each count
<unk> faces potential fines of <unk> for each count
individuals familiar with the case said that throughout <unk> defense attorneys were talking with the government in an effort to prevent a trial but by the end of the month the talks had ended
there is much speculation among attorneys not involved that the strategy of <unk> attorney <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> counsel <unk> <unk> will include testimony by <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk>
neither testified at the previous trials
for now defense attorneys are tight - lipped about their plans
<unk> <unk> another <unk> defense attorney said yesterday as we go in for the third time <unk> <unk> famous line is apt it deja vu all over again
<unk> <unk> claimants hope to stop reorganization - plan appeal
attorneys for more than n women who claim injuries from the <unk> <unk> contraceptive device have asked the <unk> <unk> <unk> to refuse to hear an appeal of the bankruptcy - law reorganization plan for <unk> <unk> <unk> which manufactured the device
the dispute pits two groups of claimants against each other
<unk> attorney <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> other attorneys representing n claimants in the <unk> and abroad argue that the appeal would delay and perhaps even destroy a n billion settlement fund that is the centerpiece of the reorganization plan
the bankruptcy - court reorganization is being challenged before the <unk> <unk> by a dissident group of claimants because it places a cap on the total amount of money available to settle claims
it also bars future suits against <unk> company officials members of the <unk> family and <unk> former insurer <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the latter provision is legally unprecedented said n <unk> <unk> <unk> a public interest lawyer in <unk> <unk> who is challenging the plan on behalf of <unk> claimants
more than n claims against <unk> are pending
the company made and marketed the <unk> <unk> in the early n amid mounting evidence that it could cause serious injuries
<unk> has been in proceedings under chapter n of the <unk> <unk> <unk> since <unk> <unk> such proceedings give it protection from creditor lawsuits while it works out a plan for paying its debts
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> wants to acquire <unk> but only if all legal challenges to the plan are exhausted
in a brief filed with the <unk> <unk> last week <unk> <unk> criticizes the appeal for raising abstract and theoretical legal issues while jeopardizing the proposed reorganization and the settlement payments to claimants
the <unk> <unk> is scheduled to consider the case <unk> n and may issue a decision as early as <unk> n
jury criminal conviction under <unk> law is a first
<unk> <unk> <unk> sole proprieter of a <unk> <unk> demolition company was found guilty of violating the <unk> law as well as the <unk> <unk> <unk>
criminal convictions under the federal <unk> law are rare and the decision is the first jury verdict in such a case
under <unk> those who owned generated or transported hazardous waste are liable for its cleanup regardless of whether their actions were legal at the time
environmental lawyers say n virtually all of the <unk> cases to date have involved civil penalties designed to insure cleanup of past polluting activities
but <unk> also contains a criminal provision concerning the release of toxic substances into the environment
in <unk> <unk> strengthened the penalty by making it a felony
<unk> <unk> was convicted in <unk> late last month of violating <unk> by failing to report the release of asbestos into the environment from a building n he was demolishing
he was also convicted of failing to properly remove asbestos from the building a violation of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
the government sought a criminal penalty because no cleanup is possible here
once asbestos is released into the environment it can lodge anywhere says <unk> a. <unk> the assistant <unk> attorney who prosecuted the case
<unk> <unk> is scheduled to be sentenced <unk> n
his lawyer could not be reached for comment

the law firm has filed a friend - of-the-court brief jointly with the <unk> <unk> <unk> a conservative legal group
the key issue in the case which the law firm is handling without a fee or pro bono is whether a person sentenced to death can voluntarily waive his rights of appellate review
the murderer <unk> <unk> <unk> was convicted of killing n people
another murderer on death row has appealed <unk> <unk> death sentence in a next friend capacity
<unk> <unk> brief argues that there is no mandatory appellate review of capital sentences and that the inmate who filed the appeal lacks proper standing
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> managing partner says <unk> the trial team that represented <unk> <unk> was asked by the firm pro bono committee whether the new case posed a conflict and that no objections were raised
the coupling of the law firm and the <unk> <unk> <unk> is odd also because <unk> <unk> was one of the firms singled out for criticism two years ago by the conservative legal group for displaying a liberal bias in its pro bono work
we give them a lot of credit for taking this case says <unk> <unk> <unk>

in addition analysts have viewed the rights offering as a takeover defense that prospectively balloons the number of shares outstanding
each of the units consists of two warrants each of which could be used to purchase a half - share of common stock and one depositary preference share

the <unk> <unk> has revised certain internal guidelines and clarified others in a move that could restrict the use of criminal racketeering charges against white - collar defendants
the most significant changes in department policy are new requirements that federal prosecutors avoid disrupting the normal business functions of companies charged under the racketeering law a senior department official said <unk>
another important revision of department policy is a new guideline warning prosecutors not to take steps that would harm innocent third parties in a case brought under the racketeering law the official <unk> <unk> said <unk>
the department distributed the revisions and clarifications to <unk> attorneys around the country this summer as part of a routine process of updating prosecutorial guidelines <unk> <unk> said <unk>
the changes apply to prosecutions brought under the <unk> <unk> and <unk> organizations law
under that law defendants who allegedly commit a pattern of crimes by means of a criminal enterprise may be charged with racketeering and forced to forfeit the proceeds of the enterprise
the <unk> law has come under criticism from some defendants and defense lawyers
they argue that the rights of <unk> defendants and third parties not named in <unk> indictments have been unfairly damaged
the department most significant clarification of existing <unk> policy is a directive to prosecutors that they should seek to seize assets from defendants in proportion to the nature of the alleged offense <unk> <unk> said <unk>
that means that if the offense deals with one part of the business you do n't attempt to seize the whole business you attempt to seize assets related to the crime he explained
in general the thrust of the department directive is to encourage prosecutors to limit pretrial asset seizures if there are less intrusive means of protecting assets <unk> the government may subsequently be able to seize after a conviction <unk> <unk> said <unk>
it was the kind of snubbing rarely seen within the <unk> let alone within the same party
<unk> <unk> <unk> trekked over to the <unk> side of <unk> <unk> a few days ago and volunteered his testimony to fellow <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
it was offered as an expression of cooperation to <unk> <unk> who is investigating the n billion failure of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
but instead of thanks <unk> <unk> was treated with cool formality
every witness receives a formal subpoena <unk> <unk> told him
seldom have <unk> hearings caused so much apprehension in the <unk> where <unk> <unk> <unk> and four other senators were already writhing in the glare of unfavorable publicity over the alleged looting of <unk> by their friend and political benefactor <unk> <unk> <unk> principal stockholder of <unk> parent company <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
at the first day of the <unk> <unk> <unk> hearings last week <unk> <unk> chairman of the <unk> <unk> <unk> the federal agency created to sell sick thrifts said <unk> the agency is investigating whether <unk> made illegal political contributions
<unk> <unk> arranged nearly n million in donations to <unk> <unk> and his various political causes and hundreds of thousands more to other lawmakers
future witnesses include a former federal s&l regulator who has accused the five senators of attempting to subvert the regulatory process by intervening on behalf of <unk> <unk>
unlike many lawmakers <unk> <unk> says <unk> he considers intervening with regulators to be improper
when you reach a point where a policy - making body is trying to shape administrative decisions then that a no - no in my book the <unk> lawmaker says
and he has attached himself to the <unk> story tenaciously
unless the questions are answered i will keep on going
lawmakers often are reluctant to embarrass colleagues even those of opposing political parties
in the recent <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> scandal for example <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> who led the hearings tiptoed through embarrassing disclosures about <unk> grants secured by <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>
but <unk> <unk> is a genuine maverick
he comes from the same political line as <unk> <unk> a bank - baiting <unk> populist who chaired the <unk> <unk> until <unk>
<unk> <unk> is also a stickler for ethical standards who refuses to accept honorariums and who believes in conducting official business in the open
early in his political career as a city councilman in <unk> <unk> he walked out of a meeting when political supporters asked that the police chief be replaced denouncing the closed - door affair publicly as a bat - roost meeting
the immediate target of <unk> <unk> inquiry is <unk> <unk> chairman of the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
as the principal regulator of the thrift industry <unk> <unk> delayed seizing <unk> s&l for more than two years after his staff told him that the <unk> thrift was insolvent and that potential losses to taxpayers were growing rapidly
<unk> <unk> seems primed to lash out at <unk> <unk> when hearings resume <unk> with testimony by two federal regulators from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> relieved them of responsibility for supervising <unk> in <unk>
<unk> <unk> expressed concern over a report that the two had been summoned to <unk> by <unk> <unk> last week to discuss their testimony in advance
i think n he is trying to improperly influence a witness and by <unk> i not going to tolerate it he says
<unk> <unk> however is a self - proclaimed child of the <unk> and former staff director of its <unk> <unk>
an inquiry into his handling of <unk> <unk> inevitably will drag in <unk> <unk> and the four others <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
they all attended a meeting in <unk> n questioning why a federal audit of <unk> <unk> had dragged on for two years
i certain that in the course of the hearings the names of the senators will be brought out <unk> <unk> says
this is raising eyebrows
when i first got a glimpse at the witness list i could n't believe that they were going to go ahead and do this says <unk> <unk> director of <unk> <unk> a consumer group
there are some witnesses who will be forced to testify about their meetings with senators
and a democratic aide to a <unk> <unk> member remarks i too am astounded by it because <unk> has certainly placed a lot of democratic senators in a very bad position
all the senators say n they merely were trying to ensure fairness for a constituent
<unk> <unk> lives in <unk> and the <unk> thrift parent is an <unk> - chartered corporation with holdings in <unk>
<unk> <unk> expresses sympathy for <unk> <unk> his counterpart as chairman of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
he wise he good and i know <unk> he an honest man the <unk> says
but at the same time <unk> <unk> has n't forgotten a confrontation over <unk> <unk> during <unk> - <unk> negotiations over s&l bailout legislation during the summer
the <unk> negotiators included <unk> . <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> principal sponsor republican <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>
they were willing to trade important provisions in the bailout legislation to preserve <unk> <unk> job and to avoid a reconfirmation hearing in which he would be called upon to testify about <unk> <unk>
most importantly the <unk> traded away the <unk> administration controversial plan to finance the bailout which was partly reinstated later
at the time <unk> <unk> said <unk> several senators told him that they could get some roadblocks out of the way if there could be some understanding on <unk> insistence on <unk>
now <unk> <unk> is holding the equivalent of reconfirmation hearings anyway under the guise of the <unk> investigation
in a way that what this is <unk> <unk> concedes
even some <unk> <unk> <unk> members could suffer from the fallout
<unk> <unk> raised n for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> re - election campaign while the <unk> <unk> was taking his side against regulators who wanted to curb risky investments and wholesale deposit brokering
he recently voted present when the committee authorized a subpoena n to compel <unk> <unk> to testify then changed his vote to yes
but the chairman supporters have the upper hand as federal regulators press a <unk> billion fraud suit against <unk> <unk> and others
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> says <unk> the <unk> <unk> affair is the biggest bank heist in history and adds the great question that remains to be resolved is whether we have a congressional <unk> in the making
a witness set to testify on <unk> was quoted in a news report over the weekend as saying <unk> <unk> laundered campaign contributions illegally
but the witness <unk> <unk> <unk> chief state thrift regulator denies saying that
i do n't know whether it was done properly or not because i not a lawyer he said in a telephone interview yesterday
but he said n he is prepared to testify that executives of <unk> and its parent corporation got unusually high salaries and frequent calls directing them to make specific contributions
the committee also has summoned <unk> <unk> predecessor <unk> <unk>
he has characterized the five senators roles as tantamount to an attempt to subvert the regulatory process and he is n't expected to back down even though the five senators have disputed his account of a <unk> meeting
so the senators must brace themselves
<unk> <unk> as he returned to the capital last week from a one - day trip n to inspect earthquake damage in <unk> <unk> sighed to an aide well back to <unk>
when <unk> <unk> and her family immigrated to the <unk> n years ago they started life in <unk> <unk> with only n
they actually left the <unk> <unk> with <unk> but during a stop in <unk> <unk> <unk> dropped <unk> on a black velvet suit
not surprisingly she quickly adapted to the american way
three months after she arrived in <unk> she spent n <unk> she did n't have for a hat
a turban she specifies though it was n't the time for that n years ago
but i loved turbans
since then she has become wealthy
her husband and older son a computer prodigy profiled in the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> when he was <unk> run a software company with expected sales this year of n million
most recently she has become the publisher of <unk> a four - year-old <unk> <unk> magazine that began national distribution last month with an initial press run of n copies
distributed by the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the glossy publication melds <unk> <unk> gossipy archness and <unk> earnest delving into behind - the-scenes minutiae with a special emphasis on <unk> as fashion trendsetter
it being sold through bookstores newsstands and some video stores
<unk> <unk> <unk> is a small woman she has an outsized personality and dramatic flair that seem perfectly suited to capitalism as it is practiced in <unk>
certainly life for her has changed considerably since the days in <unk> when she lived with her parents her husband and her two sons in a n n apartment in what she calls silent internal immigration dreaming of escape
now for example she owns n hats
however she remembers the lean years and recalls with relish wearing her first major american purchase that turban n years later and having a <unk> <unk> boutique owner ask her if it was a <unk>
with obvious satisfaction she says <unk> she told him no darling i just give it a <unk> look
she keeps track of the rest of her hats by stapling <unk> snapshots to the outside of each hatbox
are the hats merely part of her new <unk> persona along with the many ultra - thin <unk> cigarettes n she smokes the parties <unk> she throws for n people the chekovian feasts <unk> she offers guests at her weekend place in <unk> <unk>
no darling she said recently in her fluent slightly affected <unk> during a trip <unk> <unk> to promote <unk> national expansion
you have to be born with it
i used to wear hats in <unk> but i had to make them and my dresses
on the hat side i was n't getting what i wanted
now n years old <unk> <unk> has definite ideas about what she wants
at <unk> she wants specific paragraphing specific tone a specific attitude bright and bold and tongue - in-cheek
in restaurants in this case the russian <unk> a <unk> <unk> restaurant operated by and for soviet emigres she did n't want the chirpy folkish music bouncing through the room
you people here think n this is russian music she said with disdain and called over to the waitress could you turn it off
that done <unk> <unk> spoke with rampant eloquence about the many attributes <unk> she feels n she was born with an understanding of food business russian culture human nature and parties
parties are rather a state of mind she said pausing only to taste and pass judgment on the georgian shashlik a little well done but very good
if you are born to give parties you give parties
even in <unk> we managed to give parties
in <unk> <unk> in our lean years we gave parties
as publisher of a magazine devoted to movies as guideposts for fashion and other fantasies <unk> <unk> sees her party - giving as an important part of business
she has thrown extravagant soirees for crowds of people but prefers more intimate gatherings
at american cocktail parties everyone always looking over your shoulder to see who they can talk to next
i like rather tea because it is at the end of the day
she serves high russian tea at <unk> p.m
it supposed to be later but i just moved it
in <unk> <unk> it important to catch people just after work
she also frequently invites directors producers actors writers and other show business people for coffee and clips in the pleasure dome
guests bring movies on tape and show their favorite three - to-five minute segments on the screen that unrolls from the ceiling of the <unk> art - nouveau library the pleasure dome
they eat sinful and sensual things and explain their clips
it very revealing and soul baring said <unk> <unk>
the idea for <unk> actually was dreamed up by an old friend of the volokhs <unk> <unk> who has the title of co - publisher and <unk> <unk> <unk> now the magazine <unk> - editor
<unk> <unk> approached <unk> <unk> five years ago about backing the publication which started out as a listing guide
she was interested only if she could guide it editorially as well
<unk> does n't believe in blandness said <unk> <unk>
she wants things to be exciting
and she has this inexhaustible energy
she think of an idea n the editorial people think n is impossible then she have us make it work
in fact <unk> <unk> was n't just a rich lady who needed a hobby
back in the <unk> <unk> she was a respected journalist writing a weekly column about the national cuisine for <unk> <unk>
those columns vivid discussions of the cultural and literary reverberations of food as well as practical advice on how to glamorize dreary sovietized meals became the basis for her erudite and entertaining cookbook the <unk> of <unk> <unk> brought out in <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk>
i do n't trust people who do n't eat said <unk> <unk> though she herself stopped eating lunch a few years ago to drop n pounds
look at <unk> and <unk>
no one ever eats in their books and look at them
<unk> characters eat <unk> <unk>
in her cookbook which <unk> is bringing out in soft cover this month with the blini recipe revised so it works she introduces each chapter with appropriate quotations from russian literature <unk> on blini <unk> on piroghi
in life she offers practical dieting advice <unk> your meals into important and unimportant
in a great restaurant do n't deprive yourself
the other meals do n't matter
<unk> as she is and frivolous as she can seem this is a serious person with some difficult memories
she was the child of relative privilege
her mother was a translator her father was the eternal vice director
i emigrated to wear better hats do better parties she said with a giggle
but we should n't leave out political reasons number one
you try to maintain your dignity under difficult circumstances
one can not imagine how you live when you live those double and triple lives
by n after their second child was born it had become clear to <unk> <unk> and her husband <unk> a computer scientist that they wanted to leave the <unk>
<unk> <unk> quit her job to remove herself from the public eye
the wait was miserable
before granting <unk> <unk> parents a visa the government required her mother to obtain permission from her first husband whom she had divorced n years earlier
<unk> <unk> was fired from his job and had to endure hours of organized verbal abuse from his co - workers accusations of sabotage and counterrevolutionary activities
the volokhs were afraid that they end up like a friend of theirs who applied for a visa and waited for n years having been demoted from his profession of theoretical mathematician to shipping clerk
they did n't
their visa came in relatively short order and they moved to <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> soon found work in his field but <unk> <unk> refused the obvious and available occupation as translator for a <unk> who spoke fluent <unk>
that always looking back she said
i wanted to be in business
on the way to that goal she received her first <unk> paycheck for proofreading a book of polish poetry attended secretarial school then went to work for a fund - raising organization
soon she was running the office
when her husband and son founded their computer company <unk> she worked as business manager bookkeeper and publicist
now <unk> is located in the same building as <unk>
things work out unexpectedly in life said <unk> <unk>
you never know if you be chosen to be the scapegoat or the lucky one
we were lucky
<unk> <unk> <unk> president of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> has a warning for <unk> companies trying to do business in the <unk> <unk>
it an extremely complex market and you have to be prepared to make a big commitment <unk> <unk> says
we are not trying to encourage everyone
undeterred by such words of caution corporate <unk> is flocking to <unk> lured by a huge untapped market and <unk> <unk> attempt to overhaul the soviet economy
doing business with the russians once the pursuit of a handful of hardened veterans has become the goal of such major companies as <unk> motors <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> as well as a cluster of smaller firms
reflecting the new - found interest more than n <unk> companies are taking part in a <unk> exhibition organized by <unk> <unk> trade group
but while <unk> interest may be big and growing the difficulties that have stymied deals in the past show no sign of abating
alongside the old problems of a non - convertible currency and an inpenetrable bureaucracy western business executives must now grapple with new complexities linked to perestroika the restructuring of the soviet economy
executives say <unk> <unk> <unk> moves to break up the government foreign trade monopoly have created uncertainties as well as opportunities
changing legislation has opened the field to thousands of inexperienced soviet players many who promise more than they can deliver
and some foreign firms are finding that even when they manage to overcome such hurdles their ventures now have to be endorsed by such unpredictable bodies as the <unk> parliament and the governments of the nation republics
you have to go out to all your constituents says <unk> <unk> <unk> who is spearheading the most ambitious attempt by <unk> firms to break into the soviet market involving investment of more than n billion in some two dozen joint ventures
as part of that attempt by the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> says <unk> he spends a lot of time lobbying
growing public fears about the soviet environment is one new factor affecting some joint - venture plans
over the past two years soviet ministries have been talking to international firms including <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> of <unk> and several japanese groups about jointly building and operating several big petrochemical plants
the plans have come under fire from soviet environmentalists and officials say n many are likely to be scaled back or dropped
whatever the difficulties <unk> <unk> remains committed to increasing foreign trade
for political as well as economic reasons <unk> companies are at the top of his priorities a point n he underscored by spending two hours walking around the <unk> trade show last week
talking to a small group of <unk> executives afterwards <unk> <unk> appeared impatient for a big expansion in u.s.-soviet trade which now amounts to a meager n billion annually
the <unk> ranks fourth of countries that have concluded joint ventures behind <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
according to several people present at the meeting <unk> <unk> also supported the idea of concluding several commercial accords with the <unk> possibly at his next summit meeting with <unk> <unk>
judging by the crush at the exhibition deprived soviet consumers are more than ready for <unk> products
hundreds of people lined up every day at the <unk> - <unk> <unk> stand to receive a free tube of toothpaste a commodity in chronically short supply here
and unruly crowds at <unk> <unk> <unk> booth almost knocked over a glass showcase in the rush to get a free <unk> cigarette sticker
some <unk> products are filtering into the soviet market under an emergency import program
both <unk> and <unk> <unk> have received big orders for toothpaste soap and detergents
the <unk> <unk> <unk> says n it is planning to ship some n million of consumer goods financed by bank credits in the first few months of next year
but the current soviet purchasing spree may be a one - time affair
the goal of most <unk> firms joint ventures remains elusive
because the soviet ruble is n't convertible into dollars marks and other western currencies companies that hope to set up production facilities here must either export some of the goods to earn hard currency or find soviet goods n they can take in a counter - trade transaction
international competition for the few soviet goods that can be sold on world markets is heating up however
<unk> <unk> <unk> an entrepreneur from <unk> <unk> who buys soviet porcelain and matryoshka nesting dolls for export to the <unk> says n west german companies already have snapped up much of the production of these items

several medical concerns including <unk> <unk> <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> intend to pursue a similar consortium approach
it hard to invest capital here on the same basis as investing in other countries says <unk> <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who is putting the medical consortium together
some <unk> entrepreneurs operate on a smaller scale
one group seeks to publish a u.s.-soviet medical journal in conjunction with the <unk> <unk> of <unk>
according to <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> - based official of the <unk> partner <unk> copies of the quarterly will be printed in <unk> from next year
it will be financed by advertisements from <unk> companies and by simultaneous publication of an english - language journal containing details of soviet medical advancements

chip memory is here today here
two companies plan to market a new chip with ceramic circuits that store data even when the power is off
today most widely used data - storing chips have volatile memories their data disappear if they are n't fed a steady diet of electricity so they need external power supplies
<unk> <unk> <unk> and a start - up named <unk> <unk> plan to start shipping so - called ferroelectric memories which can remember data for at least n years without any current flowing to them
the chips use materials such as lead zirconate titanate to form microscopic switches that retain their data without electricity
developers caution that broad applications are several years away because the technology is n't fully refined
but <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> plans to start shipping commercial quantities of simple ferroelectric chips in <unk>
the company expects the chips eventually to be used in devices that mimic a whole range of computer memory equipment including floppy - disk and hard - disk drives
<unk> <unk> is getting ferroelectric technology from <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
<unk> says <unk> it agreed to acquire <unk> assets and will start shipping commercial quantities of its first chips including a <unk> memory next year
once production hurdles are overcome the chips could take over a significant part of the market
in addition to not needing an outside power source they are potentially cheaper to make because they require fewer manufacturing steps than conventional chips
military buyers have shown interest <unk> says <unk> because ferroelectric chips resist atomic radiation
and while today non - volatile chips such as electronically erasable programmable read - only memory chips ca n't be used in a computer central memory because they learn data slowly ferroelectric chips accept data at very high speeds
showing up in court without being
an <unk> <unk> company plans to make it easy for you show up in court a thousand miles away without leaving town
witnesses often must travel long distances to give face - to-face depositions before lawyers and court reporters

japanese reverse tack on patent
<unk> <unk> of <unk> patents has been a sore point for american chip makers
now at least one japanese company is turning the courtroom tables
until now most japanese charges have been responses to suits against them
but last year <unk> <unk> surprised <unk> electronics industry when it accused <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of using <unk> technology to make dynamic random - access memory chips
a settlement was reached but was n't made public
and <unk> went on the offensive against the <unk> <unk> <unk> earlier this month with a suit charging that <unk> new <unk> chip infringes on a <unk> patent
another recent <unk> suit accuses <unk> of reverse engineering a <unk> technology a turnabout from a nation of champion reverse engineers
the moves illustrate the more aggressive attitude toward patent protection that patent experts say n <unk> is starting to take
<unk> made the reverse - engineering charges in an amendment to a counterclaim filed in a federal district court in <unk> after <unk> sued <unk> for patent violation
<unk> charges <unk> <unk> has engaged in fraudulent and inequitable conduct in the procurement of certain <unk> patents used in <unk> <unk> microprocessor chip
translation <unk> appears to have taken a <unk> technology that is patented in the <unk> <unk> says <unk> and tried to make it look like a new technology

<unk> <unk> citing sluggish sales of consumer - electronics goods said n net income dropped <unk> for the first quarter ended <unk> n
the results which represented the fifth consecutive quarter of flat - to-lower earnings for the big electronics retailer disappointed analysts and traders
<unk> stock fell n a share to close at <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> composite trading
net for the quarter was n million or n cents a share down from n million or n cents a share a year earlier
the company said <unk> earnings would have increased if it had n't been actively repurchasing its shares thus increasing its interest expense and reducing its interest income
<unk> had n million shares outstanding at <unk> n down from n million a year earlier
revenue rose <unk> to n million from n million
<unk> said <unk> consumer electronics sales at its <unk> <unk> stores have been slow partly because of a lack of hot new products
<unk> <unk> continues to be lackluster said <unk> <unk> analyst with <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>
he said <unk> <unk> has done a decent job increasing sales by manufacturing computers for others and expanding sales of its <unk> systems <unk> subsidiary which sells computers to bigger businesses but it not enough <unk> to offset the problems at <unk> <unk>
sales at <unk> <unk> stores open more than a year grew only n in the quarter from a year earlier he said n
as a result <unk> <unk> said <unk> he cut his fiscal n per - share earnings estimate for <unk> to <unk> from <unk>
<unk> earned n million or <unk> a share in the year ended <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> also has suffered from lethargic sales of its computers aimed at the home and small - office market which are less - advanced and cheaper than computers aimed at the corporate market
<unk> has added several new products to that line including a laptop computer priced around <unk> and is focusing its advertising on the easy - to-use software that is packaged with its machines
<unk> <unk> and other analysts hope <unk> all those moves will combine to help <unk> results improve in the important <unk> quarter
they been promising <unk> to n growth based on the strategic moves n they made he said

at a private dinner <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> chief executive <unk> <unk> delivered a sobering message about the junk bond market to officials of <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>
<unk> <unk> conceded <unk> the junk market was in disarray according to people familiar with the discussion
he said <unk> <unk> the leading underwriter of high - risk junk bonds could no longer afford to sell any junk offerings if they might later become troubled because <unk> risked losing its highly lucrative junk franchise
the dinner was a stark confirmation that <unk> is the worst year ever for the <unk> billion junk market
and investors and traders alike say n the current turmoil could take years to resolve
amid the market disorder even <unk> which has the widest and most loyal following of junk bond investors is pulling in its horns
although the big investment bank still dominates the junk market <unk> has been unable to stem the fallout from growing junk bond defaults withdrawn new offerings redemptions by shareholders in junk bond mutual funds and an exodus of once - devoted investors
for many money managers the past four months have been humiliating
this is the worst shakeout ever in the junk market and it could take years before it over says <unk> <unk> a senior vice president at <unk> <unk> <unk> a credit rating company
in the third quarter for example junk bonds those with less than an investment - grade rating showed negative returns the only major sector of the bond market <unk> to do so
since the end of last year junk bonds have been outperformed by all categories of investment - grade bonds including ultra - safe <unk> securities
the junk market which mushroomed to n billion from less than n billion at the start of the decade has been declining for months as issuers have stumbled under the weight of hefty interest payments
the fragile market received its biggest jolt last month from <unk> <unk> which created its <unk> retailing empire with more than n billion in junk financing
<unk> developed a cash squeeze that caused it to be tardy on some interest payments and to put its prestigious <unk> department store chain up for sale
at that point the junk market went into a tailspin as buyers disappeared and investors tried to sell
in an interview <unk> <unk> says <unk> his dinner discussion with the prudential executives acknowledged problems for junk
what i thought n i was saying is that the market is troubled but still viable and appropriately enough quite quality - conscious which is not at all bad he says
nobody been perfect in their credit judgments the past couple years and we going to make sure n our default rates are going to be in the acceptable parameters of the market
what has jolted many junk buyers is the sudden realization that junk bonds can not necessarily be bought and sold with the ease of common stocks and many investment - grade bonds
unlike the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> where buyers and sellers are quickly matched the junk market where risky corporate loans are traded is sometimes closed for repairs
at closely held <unk> <unk> <unk> junk bond money managers <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> say <unk> the problems of the junk market go deeper than a temporary malaise
in recent months they say n there has been heavy selling of junk bonds by some of the market traditional investors while new buyers have n't materialized to replace them
<unk> <unk> securities firms the primary source of liquidity for the high yield market have been net sellers of junk bonds because of trading losses <unk> said n in a recent grim report to customers
mutual funds have also been net sellers of junk bonds as junk relatively poor performance and negative press coverage have produced above - normal redemptions by shareholders <unk> said n
investors trying to raise cash have sold large liquid issues such as <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> declines in these benchmark issues have contributed to the market distress
and <unk> said n buying has been severely reduced because savings and loans have been restricted in their junk purchases by recently passed congressional legislation
in fact savings and loans were sellers of high yield holdings throughout the quarter <unk> said
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> say <unk> they are managing their junk portfolios defensively building cash and selectively upgrading the overall quality
meanwhile <unk> the nation largest insurer and the biggest investor in junk bonds has seen the value of its junk bond portfolio drop to n billion from n billion since <unk> because of falling junk prices
we certainly do have a lack of liquidity here and it something n to be concerned about says <unk> <unk> <unk> a managing director
i have no reason n to think n things will get worse but this market has a knack for surprising us
this market teaches us to be humble
the junk market yield hogs are learning a real painful lesson he says n
although the majority of junk bonds outstanding show no signs of default the market has downgraded many junk issues as if they were in trouble says <unk> <unk> <unk> manager of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> n billion investment - grade public bond portfolio
but we think n the risks are there for things getting a lot worse
and the risks are n't appropriate for us he says
the big insurer unlike <unk> owns only about n million of publicly sold junk bonds
the string of big junk bond defaults which have been a major cause of the market problems this year probably will persist some analysts say n
if anything we going to see defaults increase because credit ratings have declined says <unk> <unk> associate professor at the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>
<unk> <unk> whose study on junk bond defaults caused a furor on <unk> <unk> when it was disclosed last <unk> says <unk> this year junk bond defaults already show a high correlation with his own findings
his study showed that junk bonds over time had a cumulative default rate of n
one indication of a growing number of junk defaults <unk> <unk> says <unk> is that about half of the <unk> billion of corporate bonds outstanding that have been lowered to a default rating by <unk> this year are junk bonds sold during the market big issue years of <unk> through n
these bonds now rated single - d include junk offerings by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> resorts <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
obviously we got a lot more smoke than fire from the people who told us n the market was n't so risky says <unk> <unk> professor of finance at <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> in <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> has just completed a study that finds that the risks and returns of junk bonds are less than on common stocks but more than on investment - grade bonds
<unk> <unk> says the junk market is no bonanza as <unk> claimed <unk> but it also is n't a disaster as the doomsayers say n
despite the junk market problems <unk> continues to enjoy a loyalty among junk bond investors that its <unk> <unk> rivals have n't found
during the past three weeks for example <unk> has sold <unk> billion of new junk bonds for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
still the list of troubled <unk> bond offerings dwarfs that of any firm on <unk> <unk> as does its successful offerings
troubled <unk> - underwritten issues include <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
<unk> junk bonds will continue to trade well says <unk> <unk> chairman of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
but the deals that never should have been brought have now become nuclear waste
as <unk> <unk> who owns an art porcelain company sipped her luncheon cocktail she reeled off the names of a few pals <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
then flashing a diamond ring as big as the <unk> my day diamond darling she told her two companions that she is on the board of the <unk> <unk> in <unk>
as it turns out the board has a lot of important members including <unk> <unk> former postmaster general of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> widow of the inventor of auto - strop razor and <unk> <unk> an investment banker at <unk> <unk> <unk>
but <unk> <unk> did n't mention any of them
<unk> <unk> has a way with names says <unk> <unk> a gossip columnist for <unk> and son of <unk> <unk> a founder of <unk>
like which are droppable and which are not
with the fall social season well under way name - droppers are out in force trying to impress their betters and sometimes put down their lessers
but the truth is that almost everyone from real - estate agents to city fathers name - drops and a surprising number of people have an ancient uncle who claims n he lived next door to the cartoonist who did the <unk> <unk>
in case you have forgotten his name was <unk> <unk>
name - dropping is pervasive and getting more so as society becomes more complex and alienating says <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> psychoanalyst with a high - powered clientele
it can be an avenue of entrance to a certain sector of society
it provides some people a needed sense of affiliation and can help open up a conversation with someone n you do n't know
like the <unk> <unk> matron in the theater district the other day who swore to a stranger that she once met <unk> <unk>
i was having a drink in <unk> when all of a sudden i saw a woman backside coming up the steps on the second floor and she was wearing sequined slacks
i knew n it was someone important so i followed her into the ladies room and sure enough it was <unk>
so i said hello
and she said hello
can you imagine
<unk> said hello to me
some people must drop names call it an irresistible impulse
they ca n't help talking about the big important people n they know even if they do n't really know them says <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> - <unk> a <unk> <unk> writer who changed his name from <unk> <unk> in <unk> is an inveterate name - dropper
i do it innately and pathologically and while it may occasionally get me into trouble it also gotten me access to parties and society he says
name - dropping recently helped <unk> <unk> - <unk> crash a party <unk> <unk> magazine threw for <unk> of the n people mentioned in the diaries of the late <unk> <unk>
i guess <unk> i might have asked <unk> to leave but he drops so many good names n we decided to let him stay says <unk> <unk> publisher of <unk>
after all <unk> was the ultimate namedropper dropping five a day in his diaries
and <unk> was mentioned twice although very briefly and in passing
<unk> <unk> - <unk> says that at the party he waved to <unk> <unk> publisher of <unk> magazine we 've been in the columns together <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> art dealer i think n she knows me but i not sure and <unk> <unk> the actress she knows me but we not really the best of friends
<unk> <unk> the gossip columnist says n there are people who actually plan whose names they are going to drop before attending a party
these droppers do n't flaunt only their friendships with the <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk>
they even drop semi - obscure names like <unk> <unk> whom everybody these days apparently has heard of but no one really knows says <unk> <unk>
it the one - upsmanship of name - dropping that counts
but name - dropping has other benefits often civic
in the name of civic pride and from the desire to nullify a negative image some city promoters seek to link their municipality with the most recognizable names n the city has to offer
take <unk>
it has gotten a bad rep because its once heavily polluted <unk> <unk> caught fire because former <unk> <unk> <unk> set his hair on fire with an acetylene torch and because its proposed <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> was recently refused an urban - development grant
some people call it the <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> that is
it helps to point out how many important people came through <unk> on their way to the top says <unk> <unk> executive director of the <unk> <unk> <unk> a nonprofit organization devoted to citing the city strengths
<unk> <unk> notes that actor <unk> <unk> family owned a sporting - goods store in <unk> that the late actress <unk> <unk> who played the bad witch in the <unk> of <unk> once ran a nursery school in <unk> and that comedian <unk> <unk> father a stonemason once worked on a church next to <unk> <unk> <unk> main concert hall
power names like that do n't hurt the city reputation <unk> <unk> says
in <unk> an average family can gain cachet from moving into a home vacated by the famous or near famous
why we even just sold a three - bedroom house in <unk> <unk> and were able to keep the price firm in a weak real - estate market by noting that the original <unk> <unk> lived there says <unk> <unk> a sales associate with <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> real - estate agency
most people ca n't even remember his name
it is <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> says that a n property overlooking the <unk> <unk> <unk> is priced at n million because the late actor <unk> <unk> once lived there
if <unk> had n't lived there the property might have been priced n million lower says <unk> <unk> noting that <unk> house has been bulldozed and only the swimming pool remains
<unk> agents and public - relations practitioners are notorious name - droppers
and some even do it with malice aforethought
<unk> <unk> a financial publicist in <unk> <unk> sometimes uses it to get the attention of journalists who try to avoid him
he says that when <unk> <unk> a financial columnist with <unk> <unk> has n't returned his phone calls he leaves messages with <unk> <unk> office saying that he has an important story on <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk>
he admits n he has no story on any of them on these occasions
but it does get him to return my calls and it makes me feel better for the times n he given me the brushoff <unk> <unk> says
there are of course obvious dangers to blatant unsubstantiated name - dropping
<unk> <unk> a publicity agent for the <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> warns that dropping the wrong name labels the dropper as a fake and a fraud
get caught and you dead in the water says <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> says that <unk> <unk> a client hates being called <unk>
if directors or producers phone me and say n they know <unk> i know n they never met her
she prefers <unk>
in <unk> <unk> society <unk> <unk> the very social wife of author <unk> <unk> has the nicknames <unk> <unk> and <unk>
and her husband sometimes calls her <unk>
but call her <unk> and it a sure giveaway n you not in her circle because she does n't use that name says <unk> <unk> editor - in-chief of <unk> magazine a monthly publication sent to all the right names
<unk> <unk> <unk> a nephew of the late <unk> <unk> <unk> former prime minister of <unk> <unk> is n't that impressed with most name - droppers n he meets

currently writing his memoirs <unk> <unk> an artist tells how tycoons such as the late <unk> <unk> <unk> the oil billionnaire were in fact known only by one initial their last
when you at the club you ask whether they spoken to <unk>

the auto - dealer strip in this booming suburb runs nearly five miles along <unk> <unk> stretching from the <unk> highway that circles <unk> to the <unk> <unk> a pullet - roofed fast - food restaurant and local landmark
twenty years ago in the infancy of suburban sprawl just a handful of dealerships were here
now there are n
alongside such long - familiar names as <unk> <unk> and <unk> are nameplates that did n't exist until three years ago <unk> <unk> <unk>
under construction is the strip n showroom the future home of <unk> a luxury marque launched by <unk> <unk> <unk> just two months ago
the n have spawned an explosion of consumer choice in <unk> in everything from phone companies to colas
and especially as the <unk> <unk> strip attests in cars
americans now can choose among n different models of cars vans and trucks up from just n when the decade began according to <unk> <unk> a trade publication
for car marketers it has become a much tougher battle to keep loyal customers from defecting to one of the new makes on the block
for american car buyers the proliferation of choice is both liberating and confusing
<unk> <unk> vice chairman of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> advertising agency in <unk> <unk> calls the proliferation nameplate mania
he says n the number of automobile choices is causing stress among consumers today and that people will simply ignore new models that lack a well - defined image
the winners he predicts will be brands from car makers that have traditionally been associated with quality and value
he says n it important for a new make to be as distinctive as possible while still retaining links to the parent company quality image
he applauds <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> for creating separate divisions for their new luxury models rather than simply adding more nameplates to their standard car lines
some auto executives believe n the benefits of more choice outweigh the drawbacks
there more noise out there and the consumer may have to work harder to cut through it says <unk> <unk> <unk> executive director of market research and planning at <unk> <unk> <unk>
but the reward is that there less need to make tradeoffs in choosing one wheels
<unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> likes the broader selection
she wants something big and already has looked at the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
now the <unk> car shopper is zeroing in on a full - sized van figuring that it just the thing n to haul nine grandchildren and pull a boat at the same time
that seems to be what all my friends are using to take the grandkids to the lake she says
market segmentation in cars is n't new but it far more extensive than when <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> conceived the idea n years ago
the legendary <unk> chairman declared that his company would make a car for every purse and purpose
now there are many cars for every purse and purpose
just four years ago <unk> planners divided the combined car and truck market into seven segments
today they identify <unk> distinct segments for cars and another <unk> for trucks and vans
the number of makes has mushroomed because the <unk> is the world biggest and richest market for automobiles virtually every auto maker wants to sell here
for every brand like <unk> or <unk> that has been squeezed out others such as <unk> <unk> and <unk> have come in
<unk> tries to counter the foreign invasion with new brands of its own
<unk> launched the <unk> marque this year n to sell cars made in partnership with foreign auto makers and next year <unk> long - awaited <unk> cars will make their debut
<unk> <unk> <unk> created the <unk> nameplate in <unk> <unk> to sell its <unk> - made touring sedans in the <unk>
but slow sales forced <unk> to kill the brand just last week
when consumers have so many choices brand loyalty is much harder n to maintain
the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of buying survey found that <unk> of today car buyers tend to switch brands
for the survey <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> associates and the <unk> <unk> each asked about <unk> <unk> consumers about their buying habits
which cars do <unk> favor most these days
it hard to generalize but age seems to be the best predictor
adults under age n like sports cars luxury cars convertibles and imports far more than their elders do
three of every n buyers under <unk> would prefer to buy a sports car compared with just n of adults <unk> and over according to the <unk> survey
young consumers prefer luxury cars by a <unk> to n margin even though older buyers because of their incomes are more likely to actually purchase a luxury car
perhaps most striking n of households headed by people aged <unk> to n have at least one foreign car
that true of only n of households headed by someone n or older
generally imports appeal most to americans who live in the <unk> and are well - educated affluent and especially young
for many baby boomers buying a domestic car is a totally foreign experience says <unk> <unk> auto - market analyst with <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>
such preferences persist even though many americans believe <unk> differences between imported and domestic cars are diminishing
only n of americans now believe that foreign cars get better gas mileage than domestic models the <unk> survey found down from <unk> in <unk>
some n give foreign cars higher quality ratings down from <unk> two years ago
on the other hand only <unk> say n foreign cars are less comfortable than <unk> models down from <unk> in <unk>
people in the automotive business disagree over how susceptible younger americans are to brand switching
once buying habits are formed they very hard n to break declares <unk> <unk> executive vice president for <unk> <unk> sales operations
but out on <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> sees it differently
the competition is so intense that an owner loyalty to a dealership or a car is virtually nonexistent says <unk> <unk> vice president of <unk> <unk> <unk> one of the first dealerships n to locate on the strip
thus the very fickleness of baby boomers may make it possible to win them back just as it was possible to lose them
the battle for customer loyalty is evident along the <unk> <unk> strip
<unk> <unk> <unk> recently established a special section in the service department for owners whose cars are less than a year old so they get quicker service
just down the street <unk> <unk> invites serious shoppers to test - drive a new <unk> to any other dealership along the strip and compare the cars side - by-side
manufacturers too are stretching further to lure buyers
<unk> <unk> division ignoring <unk> long - held maxim that safety does n't sell is airing television commercials touting its cars safety features
<unk> may be on to something
some n of the survey respondents said n they would buy anti - lock brakes even if they carry a medium or high price tag
more than <unk> felt the same way about air bags
both features appealed most to buyers under <unk>
in contrast dashboard computers power seats and turbo - charged engines had little appeal
but even a little appeal has a lot of attraction these days
<unk> <unk> division is offering a turbo - charged n engine on its <unk> <unk> model even though it expects to sell only about <unk> cars equipped with that option
the reason items with narrow appeal can be important in a market as fragmented as today
americans spent more than n billion on new cars and trucks last year and just n of that market exceeded <unk> <unk> sales of n billion
even if it only <unk> says <unk> <unk> <unk> would you throw away sales the size of <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> it will lay off <unk> to n technicians here effective <unk> n
the workers install maintain and repair its private branch exchanges which are large intracompany telephone networks
it a <unk> crime saga worthy of an <unk> <unk> <unk> title the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> awoke one morning last month to find eight holes in his front yard where his prized miniature palms called cycads once stood
days later the thieves returned and dug out more this time adding insult to injury
the second time he says they left the shovel
no garden - variety crime palm - tree rustling is sprouting up all over <unk> <unk> bringing big bucks to crooks who know their botany
cycads the most popular of which is the <unk> <unk> are doll - sized versions of <unk> famous long - necked palms with stubby trunks and fern - like fronds
because the <unk> is relatively rare and grows only a couple of inches a year it a pricey lawn decoration a two - foot tall <unk> can retail for <unk> and taller ones often fetch n or more
evidently somebody has realized <unk> it easy money to steal these things says <unk> <unk> a research associate specializing in cycads at the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
just last week would - be thieves damaged three sagos at <unk> <unk> home in the <unk> <unk> section before something frightened them off foiled
it hard to think n someone is raping your garden he says
police suspect that the criminals who dig up the plants in the dead of night are selling them to nurseries or landscapers
the <unk> has become a popular accent in tony new housing tracts apparently giving the rustlers a ready market for their filched fronds
thieves are going to find anybody who has enough bucks n to plant these things in their front yard says <unk> <unk> <unk> an investigator with the police department in <unk> <unk> <unk> where five such thefts have been reported in the past several weeks
the department is advising residents to plant sagos if they must in the back yard and telling nurseries to be on the lookout for anyone trying to palm one off
but for those californians who want exotic gardens out front where neighbors can appreciate them there always <unk> <unk> approach
after three sagos were stolen from his home in <unk> <unk> i put a big iron stake in the ground and tied the tree to the stake with a chain he says proudly
and you ca n't cut this chain with bolt cutters

the most controversial of these is stock - index arbitrage in which traders buy or sell baskets of stocks and offset the position with an opposite trade in stock - index futures <unk> to lock in profits
it the most controversial form of program trading because it can create abrupt price swings in the stock market
<unk> <unk> <unk> was the top program trader in <unk> but most of the firm activity involved portfolio trading strategies other than stock - index arbitrage

the complaint filed in federal district court accuses <unk> and other defendants of issuing false and misleading financial data
it also charges that <unk> the holding company for <unk> <unk> <unk> experienced major losses and writedowns because of improper assessment of the risks of junk - bond investments and wholesale consumer loan packages
the suit seeks unspecified damages
<unk> is in the midst of reducing its junk - bond holdings and getting out of the investment banking business in order to return to traditional thrift activities
the derivative suit is similar to a class - action complaint filed earlier this year
<unk> said in a statement n it expects other complaints to be filed in the wake of the original suit and a recent article in <unk> magazine that focused on the company problems
although an <unk> spokesman said n the company had n't yet been served with the derivative suit he reiterated the company statement that it would vigorously defend itself against the class - action suit
spokesmen at <unk> and <unk> <unk> said n the companies had n't yet been served with the suit

<unk> <unk> <unk> seeking to position itself in the potentially huge high - definition television market unveiled a converter that can transform conventional motion - picture film into high - definition video
the move also helps the <unk> <unk> photographic giant ensure that its motion - picture film business for which it holds a virtual monopoly supplying every <unk> movie company is n't made obsolete by the upstart hdtv business
while the prototype converter is costly it being lauded by the infant hdtv industry as a way of increasing the number of high - quality shows that can be seen on the new medium
the industry has been waiting with bated breath for the machines to come along says <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> <unk> productions <unk> a <unk> <unk> pioneer in high - definition programming
he notes that industry executives have until now worried that they would face a severe shortage of programs once consumers begin replacing their tv sets with hdtvs
japanese electronic giants such as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> have focused almost entirely on <unk> hardware and virtually ignored software or programs shot in high - definition
and only a handful of small <unk> companies are engaged in high - definition software development
it estimated that just about n hours of <unk> programming is currently available for airing
<unk> says <unk> its new ccd hdtv converter will help alleviate the problem by allowing programmers and broadcasters to convert movies and television programs shot in n motion - picture film into high - definition video
consumers will be able to switch on their hdtv sets and get all the viewing benefits n the high - tech medium offers
otherwise they be watching programs that are no different in quality from what they currently view on color tvs

the new converters are a critical link between film and the television domain says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> vice president and general manager of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> division
<unk> wo n't disclose the cost or when its converter will be on the market but it estimated n the machine may be available within two years
a similar machine already on the market made by <unk> <unk> <unk> a unit of <unk> <unk> costs about n
and the potential market is tremendous industry experts say n
if hdtv takes off in the <unk> there will be demand for some <unk> to n hdtv converters known in the industry as telecines
demand will come first from programming production companies and then from television stations
the converter is head and shoulders above anything else <unk> i seen says <unk> <unk> <unk> vice president engineering and development at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
and <unk> <unk> the program producer contends that <unk> move is a sound marketing decision
they ca n't afford to stay out of hdtv
indeed the stakes are high
the <unk> electronics industry estimates that the hdtv market will total about n billion over the next two decades with an additional n billion expected to go for related products
hdtvs break down images into more than n lines compared with n for today televisions providing considerably sharper detail
and the sets are wider resembling the dimensions of a movie screen
but the financial rewards are n't expected soon nor are they guaranteed
experts estimate <unk> the first sets of hdtvs wo n't be available for another five to n years and will probably retail for more than <unk> each in today dollars
some critics say n they wo n't be quickly embraced by consumers because of the high price
nevertheless <unk> could n't risk letting hdtv turn its motion - picture film business into a dinosaur
<unk> understands <unk> <unk> is where everybody is going says <unk> <unk> <unk>
yet another political scandal is racking <unk>
but this time it hurting opposition as well as ruling - party members
and as it unfolds it revealing some of the more tangled and seamier aspects of japanese society
already ruling <unk> <unk> <unk> demands that opposition members testify under oath in parliament have stalled one budget committee session and forced the committee to plan a special two - day investigation at the end of the month
but the scandal itself is so convoluted that ruling - party members are divided between those who want to pursue the matter in hope of undermining the opposition and those who favor leaving well enough alone
the opposition can be the most hurt because everyone already figures n the <unk> is that kind of beast says <unk> <unk> former aide to <unk> kingmaker <unk> <unk> and now an independent analyst
but he adds we ca n't tell where it will go at all because we still in the middle of it
this time the scandal centers on donations made by the not - quite-mainstream pachinko parlor industry
<unk> a kind of pinball is <unk> favorite form of legal gambling
the donations so far appear to be small especially compared with the huge sums that changed hands in the <unk> <unk> influence - peddling scandal that plagued the ruling party last year
but the implications could be great
pachinko is slightly on the shady side often linked to the lower ranks of <unk> underworld and regularly at the top of annual lists of tax evaders
recently the industry has faced the threat of new restrictions and political donations may have been made with the intent to bribe
also about <unk> of pachinko parlor owners are korean many of whom maintain close ties with <unk> or south korean residents organizations and donations by such foreign groups are illegal in <unk>
to many japanese pachinko is benign or enticingly unsavory
garish neon pachinko marquees blaze from the main streets and narrow alleys of cities and towns across the country
devotees pass hours watching the lights blink and listening to the metal balls ping as much to gamble as to get a little time n to be anonymous alone with their thoughts
at <unk> yen <unk> for a handful of balls pachinko is a common pastime and has been since it took root as cheap entertainment in the years after <unk> <unk> <unk>
but the total of all those pinging balls has created an industry with a reported annual income of n trillion yen almost n billion or nearly the size of <unk> vaunted automobile industry
and because the pachinko industry is regularly at the top of annual lists for tax evasion some observers estimate n the real income could be as much as n trillion yen
if that money were being taxed it could bring the government a badly needed several trillion yen
in n an attempt was made to crack down on the industry with tougher restrictions
then in <unk> a proposal to keep better track of income by selling prepaid cards for pachinko was fielded in parliament
the proposal split the industry in two along the lines of national origin <unk> koreans oppose the plan while south koreans japanese and taiwanese accept it or are neutral
in <unk> a conservative weekly magazine reported that a pachinko industry organization donated money to <unk> <unk> <unk> members
the magazine alleged that in making the donations the pachinko industry may have been offering bribes <unk> to win support in the battle against prepaid cards or it may have been laundering money back and forth between the <unk> and the north korean residents organization the <unk> <unk>
the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> immediately denied the report
and at first neither the opposition nor the <unk> wanted to pursue the issue
but the press kept it alive as with the <unk> scandal lists began circulating with names of people who had received money
within a matter of weeks less - conservative magazines reported that members of the ruling <unk> had received much larger donations from pachinko organizations
so far though there have been no allegations that the contributions n the <unk> members received amounted to bribes
then the two camps upped the ante reports that <unk> <unk> had donated directly to <unk> members were rapidly countered by statements that the south korean residents organization had long been donating directly to <unk> members
the <unk> admitted <unk> n that its members received about eight million yen from the pachinko organization and charged <unk> members with receiving n million yen <unk> and other opposition parties with taking about n million yen
on <unk> the chief cabinet secretary announced that eight cabinet ministers had received five million yen from the industry including n yen n by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
no one has alleged that the donations were by themselves illegal
direct donations from either of the residents organizations would be illegal because the groups are defined as foreign but both groups deny making direct donations
they say n it s possible n some of their members may be donating privately
the issue is further complicated because although the organizations represent korean residents those residents were largely born and raised in <unk> and many speak only japanese
that they retain korean citizenship and ties is a reflection of history their parents were shipped in as laborers during the decades when <unk> occupied <unk> before <unk> <unk> <unk> and the discrimination that still faces koreans in japanese society
many japanese think it only natural that the organizations or their members would donate to politicians the way n many japanese do to win favor or support
both residents organizations admit to receiving some funding from abroad
but <unk> members and supporters of the prepaid card idea tend to speak in innuendo about the <unk> alleged donations implying that north korean money would be more suspect than south korean because <unk> <unk> is communist and <unk> <unk> is an ally
when <unk> <unk> was <unk> he got a chance to play in the starting lineup for his high school basketball team in <unk> <unk>
unfortunately his mother had tickets for a recital by <unk> <unk> the same night and she was adamant about his attending
i threw such a fit says <unk> <unk> who had begun violin studies at the age of six
but once <unk> started playing i did n't give a damn about basketball
afterwards i went home and practiced for three hours
today it obvious that the brawny six - foot one - inch musician made the right choice
at <unk> <unk> <unk> has a rich full - bodied tone an admirable rhythmic precision and an increasingly busy schedule
he currently in the midst of a <unk> <unk> tour with <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> with stops including <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> n
later this season he gives a recital at <unk> <unk> <unk> and appears as soloist with several major orchestras
yet <unk> <unk> career has developed at a slower pace than those of some of his better known contemporaries
during the late <unk> he was part of a musical brat pack a group of budding virtuosos who studied at the <unk> <unk> with the noted pedagogue <unk> <unk>
his violin classmates included <unk> <unk> a protege of <unk> <unk> who performed with major orchestras while still a student <unk> - <unk> <unk> who joined the roster of <unk> <unk> <unk> at the age of <unk> and <unk> <unk> - <unk> who launched her career by winning the <unk> <unk> <unk>
i thought n i was over the hill at <unk> recalls <unk> <unk> an outgoing man with pale blue eyes and a light southern drawl
but i was n't ready for a career at that time
young <unk> first violin teacher was <unk> <unk> a hungarian refugee who taught in the <unk> public school system
he taught me how to play like a gypsy jokes the musician
i did n't learn to count until i got to <unk>
after studies at that conservatory <unk> - <unk> <unk> with an assistant to the legendary instructor <unk> <unk> he switched at the college level to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> longtime assistant and ultimately his rival
i think n i had to prove myself to her says <unk> <unk>
but she was always encouraging
she only put her foot down twice he continues
in my freshman year my roommate was known as a party animal
she thought n i was n't getting my practicing done
as the violinist tells it his grandmotherly looking teacher put her hands on her hips stomped her foot and said you just got to get the expletive deleted out of there
the second incident took place after <unk> <unk> gave an ambitious student recital and was feeling rather pleased with himself
<unk> <unk> requested that he come to her studio with a tape of the recital
we listened to the <unk> <unk> he recalls and she said you hear the first note that <unk> - flat
that the only note that truly in tune
that the most important experience <unk> i had with any teacher he says because she taught me how to listen
now when i play with orchestras the musicians often compliment me on my intonation
it was also at <unk> that <unk> <unk> discovered his predilection for conservative n american composers such as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
after winning a school competition with a performance of the latter <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was invited to play the work for the composer who was dying of cancer
<unk> was seated by the fireplace looking very pale recalls the violinist who performed the work with a piano accompanist at the composer apartment
he did n't say much but what he said was important because it not in the score
there a beautiful <unk> motif he kill me if he heard me say that throughout the first movement
the only time n the violin has it is right at the end
it written marcato in the score and i played it that way kind of gigue - like
and he yelled out dolce dolce sweet sweet
so we did it over he adds
i played very transparently with the tip of the bow
if a conductor is sensitive enough <unk> to bring down the orchestra volume at that point it makes the piece magical
i do n't know why <unk> never told anybody else
on <unk> <unk> recording it very biting
since leaving <unk> <unk> <unk> has made some smart moves and some controversial ones
his guest appearance on the <unk> soap opera another <unk> scandalized musical elitists
by contrast he won kudos for his espousal of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which he recently recorded for <unk> along with <unk> <unk> engaging <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
<unk> <unk> sweet tone heartfelt lyricism and rhythmic punch make him an ideal interpreter of both works
aided by the fluid playing of the <unk> <unk> <unk> under <unk> <unk> direction this <unk> really swings
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which sounds more like a mildly atonal rhapsody for solo violin with orchestral accompaniment meanders until the propulsive <unk> fervente
but there are ample rewards in its plaintive slow sections and virtuoso fireworks for soloist brass and timpani
at <unk> <unk> <unk> here <unk> <unk> was heard recently with <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> in more conventional fare <unk> overwrought <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
his performance was so effusive and driven that the phrases rarely breathed
the <unk> <unk> played adroitly with a big lush sound that belied its size
whatever he plays <unk> <unk> finds satisfaction in the music itself something greater out there than me as he puts it during an interview at the <unk> apartment n he shares with wife <unk> a literary publicist
a normal person did not write the <unk> <unk> <unk> he declares
even when i hear it played badly i still humbled by the piece
if i could ever feel <unk> i contributed to it in some way then all the hard work has been worth it
<unk> <unk> is a free - lance music writer in <unk> <unk>
are consumers too deep in hock
a lot of observers think so and if they right the whole economy as well as the spendthrifts among us could be hurt
a sudden forced cutback by consumers who normally account for about two - thirds of economic activity would damp the economy at a time when plant - and-equipment spending is slowing and deficit - racked governments ca n't readily take up the slack
and another wave of bad loans would further batter many already - shaky lending institutions
the worriers cite some worrisome trends
during the almost seven - year-old economic expansion inflation - adjusted gross national product disposable personal income and personal consumption expenditures have risen <unk> but inflation - adjusted consumer installment credit has surged n
and the ratio of installment debt to disposable personal income personal income after taxes has hit a high of about <unk> <unk>
however these figures do n't seem to worry <unk> a. <unk> an economist at the <unk> <unk> <unk>
in a paper presented at the recent annual meeting of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> comments that installment credit always grows rapidly in cyclical advances and growth in this cycle is very typical of earlier experiences
he adds we are now witnessing a slowdown which if history is a guide could persist for a while
but what about the debt burden
<unk> <unk> doubts that there is some magic level at which the ratio of installment debt to disposable income indicates economic problems
and more importantly he says the debt burden measured other ways is not really in uncharted waters
the chart below shows why see accompanying illustration <unk> <unk> n <unk>
the ratio of consumer installment credit to disposable income though up a bit has n't climbed steeply and such debt as a percent of household assets is little changed
moreover the burden of consumer credit payments relative to disposable income may be lower in this cycle than earlier <unk> <unk> says <unk>
he notes that some revolving credit - card credit is actually convenience credit being used simply as a handy way of paying bills rather than a handy way of borrowing
in addition he says n longer maturities on automobile and other forms of installment credit boost the stock of debt faster than the flow of repayments and the accompanying payment burden
and if you consider the changing distribution of credit <unk> <unk> says <unk> much of the increase in debt in recent years is due to increasing credit use by higher - income families that is those probably best able to handle it
citing figures on home - equity loans he notes that <unk> of homeowners had home - equity credit accounts but the proportion rises to <unk> of homeowners in the n income range and n of homeowners with income above n
and much home - equity credit is used conservatively
the most frequent use is home improvement which presumably improves the value of the property <unk> <unk> says
so it is n't surprising that consumer - credit delinquencies at banks remain as the chart shows <unk> reassuringly below some earlier highs see accompanying illustration <unk> <unk> n <unk>
a severe recession could of course raise delinquency rates but so far the current levels of consumer debt do n't seem to loom as a major threat
in fact the current weakness in auto buying and department - store sales and the gradual upturn in the household saving rate suggest that consumers conservative as ever are already clutching their purses a bit more tightly
in <unk> consumer installment credit outstanding fell for the first time since <unk> n
consumers appear unwilling to add to their leverage to support their spending <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> economist says
as a result household debt appears to be stabilizing at around <unk> of <unk>
consumers credit cards in hand are n't running amok through the shopping malls or putting the economy at any great risk

other major players in intimate apparel apparently feel the same way

<unk> could exhaust its foreign - exchange reserves as early as next year a western government report says n unless imports are cut drastically to help narrow the balance - of-payments deficit
according to the report completed last month if <unk> trade gap continues to widen at the pace seen in the first seven months of this year the reserves would be wiped out either in <unk> or <unk>
a country is considered financially healthy if its reserves cover three months of its imports
the <unk> billion of reserves <unk> <unk> had in <unk> would cover just that much
the report by the western government which declines to be identified concludes that a near - term foreign - exchange payment problem can be avoided only if import growth drops to below n per annum
according to chinese customs figures import growth has slowed in recent months dropping to <unk> in <unk> and <unk> in <unk> from the year - earlier periods compared with an average growth rate of n in the first half
but before import growth slowed <unk> buying spree in the first half already had taken its toll on foreign - exchange reserves
the <unk> billion level in <unk> marked a drop from <unk> billion at the end of <unk>
<unk> last big import binge sent reserves tumbling to <unk> billion in <unk> <unk> from n billion the previous <unk>
<unk> might stave off a crisis if it acts as forcefully as it did to arrest the n decline when <unk> slammed the brakes on foreign - exchange spending and devalued the currency
but this time <unk> faces a more difficult battle because of economic forces that have come into play since the <unk> <unk> killings <unk> <unk>
for example <unk> hard - currency income is expected to suffer from the big drop in tourist arrivals since <unk> <unk>
revenue from tourism this year is projected to total <unk> billion down from <unk> billion last year
because of this and the huge trade gap the deficit in <unk> current account which measures trade in goods and services plus certain unilateral transfers of funds is expected to widen sharply from the <unk> billion deficit last year
the western government report suggests a number of scenarios for <unk> current - account balance two of which are considered most likely
in one imports and exports continue to grow at the respective average rates of <unk> and <unk> recorded during the first seven months and the current - account deficit widens to <unk> billion
in <unk> <unk> had a record deficit of <unk> billion
the other scenario assumes that <unk> takes effective actions to curb imports in the coming months
in this case <unk> would still finish the year with a current - account deficit of n billion based on projections that imports for all of this year grow n and exports <unk>
if <unk> were still on good terms with foreign lenders it might be able to stem the drain on its foreign - exchange reserves by using some loan funds to offset the current - account deficit
but since <unk> foreign bankers led by international financial institutions have virtually suspended their new loans to <unk>
even if borrowing resumes commercial bankers are n't expected to lend as much as before
in addition economists are forecasting a slowdown in foreign direct investments as businessmen become increasingly wary of <unk> deteriorating political and economic environment
on top of all this foreign - debt repayments are expected to peak in <unk> to n
with less capital coming in <unk> balance of payments would suffer
the western government report first scenario assumes a n reduction in foreign borrowing and a <unk> contraction in foreign direct investment
in the second foreign borrowing is projected to grow n and investment to drop n
but in either case the report says <unk> <unk> balance of payments would rapidly dry up foreign reserves which are used to finance the imbalance
in the first scenario the reserves would be exhausted next year and in the second they would be wiped out in <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> parent of the swiss chemical and pharmaceutical group said <unk> its group sales rose n in the first nine months of the year to n billion francs n billion

but knowing that mechanics would probably ground him for repairs <unk> <unk> skipped his stop in nearby <unk> and set course to get his load a few hundred parcels to the <unk> package - sorting hub on time
had he been a little less gung - ho i have gotten the thing on the ground and headed for the nearest bar <unk> <unk> says n
but he flies for <unk> <unk> <unk> perhaps the closest thing in corporate <unk> to the <unk> <unk>
federal employees work long hours and seem to thrive on the stress of racing the clock
like <unk> <unk> they sometimes go to surprising lengths to meet that overarching corporate goal delivering the goods on time
they are a tribute to <unk> management which since the company founding n years ago has had its way with its work force an unusual feat in the contentious transportation industry
that may soon change
this month <unk> <unk> pilots including some n acquired along with <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> will decide whether to elect the powerful <unk> <unk> pilots <unk> as their bargaining agent
the election which would bring the first major union to <unk> <unk> operations has pitted new hires against devoted veterans such as <unk> <unk>
it has also rattled <unk> strongly anti - union management which is already contending with melding far - flung operations and with falling profits
a union sooner or later has to have an adversary and it has to have a victory <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman and chief executive says with disdain
in our formula we do n't have any losers except the competition
what managers really fear is that the pro - union movement could spread beyond the pilots
under federal transportation law a government mediator is attempting to reconcile the melding of <unk> job classifications into <unk>
depending on the outcome the merged company may face union elections this fall among airplane mechanics ramp workers stock clerks and flight dispatchers
these groups constitute up to <unk> of its work force
unions would have a profound effect on the whole culture of the company says <unk> <unk> <unk> a professor at <unk> <unk> <unk> at <unk> and a <unk> consultant
that culture carefully crafted by <unk> <unk> leaves little if any room for unions
since founding the company the charismatic <unk> vet who is still only n years old has fostered an ethos of combat
flights are missions
<unk> <unk> managers have at times been called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the <unk> <unk> award the <unk> accolade for a job well done is bestowed on <unk> workers who surpass the call of duty
competitors are known as the enemy
to reinforce employees dedication <unk> <unk> pays well
he also lets workers vent steam through an elaborate grievance procedure and as a perk fly free in empty cockpit seats
he gives pep talks in periodic family briefings beamed internationally on <unk> the company own television network
and with many of his n workers <unk> <unk> damn - the-torpedoes attitude has caught on
<unk> <unk> a courier who earned a <unk> <unk> for figuring out how to get a major customer <unk> load to its doorstep by <unk> <unk> considers himself far more than a courier
we do n't just hand the customer the package
that just the beginning he says
in essence we run the show
<unk> <unk> a longtime pilot bristles at the mere suggestion that a union might tamper with his flight schedule
this is <unk> he says
nobody has the right to tell me how much i can work
such attitudes have given <unk> flexibility <unk> not only to rapidly implement new technology but to keep its work force extraordinarily lean
the company deliberately understaffs stretching employees schedules to the limit
but though couriers work as many as n hours a week during the autumn rush they leave early during slack times while still being assured of a minimum paycheck
pilots as well routinely fly overtime to ensure that none are furloughed during seasonal lows
the operational freedom has also given <unk> a leg up on archrival <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the nation largest employer of <unk> <unk> of teamsters members
<unk> wo n't discuss its labor practices but according to <unk> <unk> a former <unk> employee and others union work rules prohibit <unk> drivers from doing more than carrying packages between customers and their vans
because <unk> drivers are n't permitted to load their own vehicles at the depot say n these couriers packages often get buried in the load and are delivered late
labor problems are the last thing <unk> <unk> <unk> needs right now
although the <unk> acquisition has brought <unk> a long way toward becoming the global player <unk> it wants to be it also has brought problems
it more than doubled <unk> long - term debt to <unk> billion thrust the company into unknown territory heavy cargo and suddenly expanded its landing rights to n countries from four
<unk> on its own had n't been doing very well overseas
it had hemorrhaged in its attempt to get into <unk> where treaty restrictions forced it to fly some planes half - empty on certain routes
on routes to <unk> <unk> the company had no backup jets n to ensure delivery when planes were grounded
in <unk> business suffered as <unk> bought several local companies only to have the managers quit
these and other problems squeezed <unk> profit margins last year to <unk> down from more than <unk> annually in the first half of the decade
earnings have plummeted too in each of the past three quarters
in the fiscal first period ended <unk> n profit fell <unk> to n million or n cents a share mostly because of the <unk> merger <unk> says <unk>
federal stock price however has held up well driven in part by the general run - up of airline stocks analysts say n
since trading as low as <unk> a share in <unk> <unk> shares have rallied as high as n in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> composite trading
they closed <unk> at <unk> down n cents on the day
there a certain irony in the fact that <unk> <unk> faces its first union problems as a result of its <unk> purchase
<unk> itself was founded by a band of gungho airmen who had airlifted supplies over the <unk> from <unk> to <unk> during <unk> <unk> <unk>
in the early <unk> <unk> <unk> modeled his fledgling company on <unk> innovation of hub - and-spoke and containerized - cargo operations
but from early on <unk> workers unionized while <unk> never have
<unk> <unk> officials acknowledge mistakes in their drive overseas but say n it will pay off eventually
analysts expect <unk> earnings to improve again in its fiscal third quarter ending <unk> n when the company should begin benefiting from <unk> extra flights back - up planes and landing rights
until then they expect the cost of integrating the two carriers to continue crimping profits
for now the union issue is the most nettlesome of <unk> <unk> problems management believes n
although encouraging dialogue between managers and workers <unk> <unk> does n't countenance what he considers insubordination
when a large group of pilots once signed petitions opposing work - rule and compensation changes he called a meeting in a company hangar and dressed them down for challenging his authority
he then made most of the changes pilots say n
that sort of approach however has n't worked since the addition of <unk>
its n workers who had battled <unk> management for years over givebacks were union members until the day of the merger when most of their unions were automatically decertified
soon after the merger moreover <unk> management asked <unk> pilots to sign an agreement stating that they could be fired any time without cause or notice
when the pilots refused the company retracted it
<unk> <unk> angered <unk> pilots too
in his haste to seal the deal with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> last <unk> <unk> <unk> ignored a promise that he had made to his own pilots three years ago that any fliers acquired in future mergers would be end - tailed put at the bottom of the pilot seniority list that determines work schedules pay and career options
the <unk> merger agreement stipulated that the lists be combined on the basis of tenure
<unk> <unk> is trying hard to allay the anger
and even some pro - union pilots say n his charisma and popularity among the many former military fliers could be tough n to beat
a lot of people are identifying a vote for representation as a vote against <unk> <unk> says <unk> <unk> a <unk> - <unk> pilot and union activist
<unk> <unk> and other top <unk> executives have met with <unk> workers in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
recently they have appeared every few weeks in talk - show type videos countering pro - union arguments
in one video <unk> <unk> defended his agreement to merge the pilot - seniority lists
he said <unk> <unk> <unk> had insisted that the merger talks move quickly
regulators as well might have quashed the deal if <unk> pilots had n't been protected he said n
furthermore <unk> <unk> added <unk> our contract with our pilots says that we will manage our fleet operations with their advice
it does n't give any particular group the ability to veto change
already the fight has been costly
the seniority - list controversy along with the job - classification dispute has been turned over to the mediator
meanwhile the company is operating with two separate pilot groups and seniority lists and that is costing <unk> a big number says <unk> <unk> <unk> executive vice president and chief operating officer
the issue has also cost <unk> management a lot of good will among its old pilots
they were willing to mistreat us because we had n't shown any moxie any resistance says <unk> <unk> a <unk> pilot and <unk> <unk> veteran
adds <unk> <unk> a n captain and past chairman of the company - sponsored <unk> <unk> <unk> they made all these magnanimous gestures to the <unk> <unk> pilots and for us nothing
such animosity could prove pivotal in the union vote
a large majority of the <unk> former <unk> fliers support the union according to a union study
but though most of the <unk> <unk> pilots are believed opposed it is unclear just how much their loyalty to <unk> <unk> has been eroded
the fight has turned ugly and among pilots at least has shattered the esprit de corps that <unk> <unk> worked so hard to build
<unk> - union pilots have held ballot - burning parties
some younger pilots say n they have had to endure anti - union harangues by senior pilots while flying across the country
and for now at least the competition is n't the only enemy
<unk> <unk> a n captain and leader of the pro - union forces said <unk> he has received two anonymous death threats and been challenged to a fight with tire irons by a colleague
the pilots are either for us or extremely against us he says with a sigh
<unk> <unk> said n it obtained a n million export order for armored recovery vehicles and related support equipment
<unk> declined to say what country placed the order
the company said <unk> it received an order for <unk> of the vehicles which retrieve tanks and other heavy - tracked vehicles when they break down or are damaged and an option for <unk> more
delivery is to begin in early n
<unk> produces products for defense industrial commercial and construction markets
the <unk> convicted <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> of eight impeachment articles removing the n judge from his n lifetime job
<unk> <unk> case was particularly nettlesome because it marked the first time <unk> a federal official was impeached and removed from office on charges of which a jury had acquitted him
in <unk> <unk> <unk> was found not guilty of accepting a <unk> bribe in a case before him the central charge on which the <unk> convicted him
he was only the sixth federal judge ever ousted from office after an impeachment trial
with no floor debate the <unk> on <unk> voted n to convict <unk> <unk> of perjury and conspiring to accept a bribe five votes more than needed
conviction on any single impeachment article was enough to remove <unk> <unk> from office
he was found not guilty of three charges involving accusations that he had improperly disclosed information about a sensitive government investigation
the <unk> did n't vote on six lesser charges
although <unk> <unk> had been acquitted by a jury lawmakers handling the prosecution in <unk> had argued that the purpose of impeachment is n't to punish an individual
instead they argued that impeachment aims to protect public institutions from people who have abused their positions of trust irrespective of the outcome of prior criminal or civil cases
<unk> <unk> faced the senators and sat impassively during the first two roll - call votes then quickly left the chamber
in an impromptu news conference on the <unk> steps he denounced the senators action
their opinion is devoid of the wisdom of the forefathers teaching regarding impeachment <unk> <unk> said
for the future he said n he would run for governor of <unk>
<unk> <unk> was appointed to the federal bench by <unk> <unk> in <unk> and was one of the few black federal judges in the country
while he packed the <unk> gallery with his supporters during some of the impeachment trial most civil rights groups kept their distance from his case
following the impeachment conviction <unk> <unk> <unk> executive director of the <unk> <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> people issued a restrained statement warning that the <unk> case could set a dangerous precedent but adding we must respect the considered judgment of the <unk>
when last we left him <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> had solved a murder mystery unraveled a <unk> political scandal and racked up some pretty good ratings numbers in the miniseries <unk> <unk>
what next for the crusty <unk> agent with the heart of gold
a spinoff series of course
there are plenty of worse inspirations for shows and most of them had already made the fall lineup
a nun raising some lovable orphans
a den mother raising some lovable teen models
a bunch of tans and bathing suits posing as lovable lifeguards
in that context <unk> <unk> riveting performance as the unlovable even crotchety veteran agent seems a better franchise for a series than most
week by week on <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> p.m <unk> he pokes around the crime styles of the rich famous and powerful of the <unk> scene a loose cannon on deck at the <unk>
over the first few weeks <unk> <unk> has sprung straight from the headlines which is either a commendable stab at topicality or a lack of imagination or both
the opening show featured a secretary of defense designate accused of womanizing a <unk> <unk> <unk>
when his secretary is found floating dead in the pol pool <unk> is called in to investigate
last week a young black girl claimed <unk> she had been raped by a white police officer a la <unk> <unk>
in this week show there an unsafe nuclear weaponsmaking facility a la <unk> <unk>
along the way we introduced to the supporting cast a blond bombshell secretary <unk> <unk> her real name honest a scheming young boss <unk> <unk> another blonde bombshell who also an idealistic lawyer <unk> <unk> and a forensics expert <unk> <unk>
if all of this seems a little stale it redeemed in part by some tricky plot twists
the usual suspects are found to be guilty then not guilty then guilty but of a different crime
in last week rape case for example the girl turns out to have been a victim of incest and the biggest villains are the politicians who exploit the case
most of all though the show is redeemed by the character of <unk>
what makes the veteran <unk> man so endearing is his hard - bitten cynicism earned we discover when he was assigned to the civil rights movement back in the n
he was n't protecting the <unk> marchers he was tailing them as subversives
this is not the <unk> <unk> scenario that thrills his young colleagues kid you been reading <unk> comics too long <unk> says
back in <unk> the <unk> had five black agents
three were chauffeurs for <unk> <unk> <unk> and two cleaned his house
at the core of <unk> <unk> <unk> is his world - weary truculence
he describes a reporter as <unk> <unk> <unk>
he describes a drowned corpse as <unk> <unk>
and when he told try a little tenderness he shoots back i going home to try a little linguine
yet for all his cynicism he at heart a closet idealist a softy with a secret crush on truth justice and the <unk> <unk>
he the kind of guy who rescues trampled flags
if <unk> <unk> has an intriguing central character it also has a major flaw
it wildly overwritten
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and writer\/producers <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> have revved this show up to the breaking point
to start there always a crisis and someone always worries what if the press gets a hold of this
at least once an episode we see protestors marching around screaming slogans
at least once <unk> boss yells in here now and proceeds to dress his investigator down
you are a dinosaur a hangover in a n suit
one more word and you are out on a park bench mister
finally of course the boss gives in but he still yelling i find myself explaining anything to <unk> <unk> you be chasing stolen cars in <unk>
in fact throughout <unk> <unk> we do n't get words or lines we get speeches
witnesses shout scream pontificate a dream that the planet could be saved from itself and from the sadistic dumb creatures who try to tear down every decent man who raises his voice
and <unk> himself is investigating at the top of his lungs how the hell can you live with yourself he erupts at a politician
you twist people trust
you built your career on prejudice and hate
the scars will be here years after the polls close
in each show <unk> gets to unleash similar harangues
where the hell are they gon na live when people like you turn the world into a big toxic waste dump
you the real criminal here and what you did was n't just a murder it was a crime against humanity
and at least once a show someone delivers the line get off that soapbox
now that advice n the writers should take to heart
they have a series with a good character some interesting even occasionally surprising plot lines and they ruining it
why when a key witness disappears does <unk> trash her apartment tearing down drapes smashing walls
it a bizarre and totally inappropriate reaction all to add more pizzazz to a script that already overdosing on pizzazz
that not plot
that not character
that hyperventilating
there is a scene at the end of the first week show where <unk> attends the unveiling of the memorial to his dead partner <unk>
asked to say a few words he pulls out his crumpled piece of paper and tries to talk but he too choked up <unk> to get the words out
he bangs on the piece of paper in frustration then turns and walks away
it was a profoundly moving moment for series television and <unk> <unk> acting resonated in the silence
there a pretty good program inside all the noise of <unk> <unk>
if the show creators could just let themselves be quiet for a little they might just hear it
with a twist of the wrist boys with tops and <unk> tossers and p.r. types with bees in their bonnet have a goal in common all of them try to put the right spin on it

<unk> <unk> has purchased an oil - producing company in <unk> for n million its first major acquisition since its legal brawl with <unk> <unk> began more than four years ago
the <unk> plains <unk> oil company said <unk> that it had acquired <unk> <unk> <unk> a subsidiary of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for n million in cash with the rest n to be paid in shares of a new non - voting issue of preferred stock
<unk> which holds properties in <unk> oil and gas fields in south <unk> will provide <unk> with mostly gas reserves
the fields contain recoverable reserves of n billion cubic feet of natural gas and four million barrels of oil
this acquisition is another indication of <unk> commitment to increase the company reserve base said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> has also been attempting to sell oil properties
at least two years ago the company put n million barrels of oil reserves on the block
they were either too small or uneconomic n to maintain the company said n
not all of those parcels have yet been sold
<unk> acquired <unk> before it completed those sales because <unk> properties are high quality and near other fields <unk> <unk> already owns a company spokeswoman said n
<unk> like many other oil companies has been struggling to replace its falling oil and gas reserves
<unk> situation had become particularly complex because much of its effort had for years been focused on its brawl with <unk> and then on <unk> <unk> investor <unk> <unk> <unk> attempt to take over the company
<unk> had sued <unk> for improperly interfering with its acquisition of a portion of <unk> <unk> <unk>
eventually <unk> which was forced into bankruptcy proceedings by that litigation settled its fight with <unk> for n billion in <unk>
<unk> <unk> who played a key role in the settlement and attempted subsequently to take control of the company sold his stake in <unk> just last summer
completion of <unk> acquisition of <unk> is subject to government approval under the <unk> - <unk> <unk> improvements <unk>
<unk> <unk> said n it reduced the estimated cash distribution for its <unk> <unk> and <unk> partners <unk> trust to between <unk> cents and n cents a share from between <unk> cents and n cents for the year ending <unk> <unk> <unk>
the change in expected cash distributions from the <unk> real estate investment trust stems from a revised estimate of administrative costs said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> executive vice president
<unk> which sponsors <unk> is a world - wide real estate investment firm
<unk> <unk> <unk> had net income of n million or <unk> a share in the fiscal year ended <unk> n
the figure was incorrectly shown as a net loss in a chart accompanying <unk> <unk> on the street column

<unk> had an unadjusted trade surplus of <unk> billion for the first <unk> days of <unk> down from <unk> billion a year earlier the <unk> <unk> said <unk>
the latest drop shows n the narrowing in the nation trade gap reflected in successive full monthly reports is continuing
the report follows five - consecutive declines in full monthly figures
imports rose sharply in the period to n billion from n billion a year earlier a change of <unk>
exports during the period were <unk> billion n below n billion a year ago
<unk> <unk> chairman said n the belgian insurer is prepared to give up some of its independence to a white knight if necessary to repel a raider
amid heavy buying of shares in <unk> largest insurer <unk> <unk> also warned in an interview that a white knight in buying out a raider could leave speculators with big losses on their <unk> stock
since the beginning of the year the stock has nearly doubled giving <unk> a market value of about n billion belgian francs n billion
the most likely white knight would be <unk> <unk> de <unk> <unk> which already owns n of <unk> and which itself is controlled by <unk> <unk> de <unk> the acquisitive french financial conglomerate
but <unk> <unk> said <unk> a rescue also could involve <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which owns n of <unk>
<unk> is hardly alone in its anxiety
a rambunctious shake - up is quickly reshaping <unk> once - stately insurance business
worried by <unk> <unk> directives that will remove many of the barriers to cross - border insurance services starting in n insurers are rushing to find partners and preparing for price wars
in <unk> <unk> and the <unk> insurers are flirting with banks
in <unk> <unk> and <unk> - <unk> assurances <unk> both have been on the prowl for giant acquisitions <unk> last month acquired control of <unk> <unk> the sixth - largest european insurance company after a takeover battle with <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> said <unk> the volume of shares changing hands has grown significantly since mid - <unk>
but he estimated that a raider would have been able to amass no more than <unk> of the shares in recent months
aside from exploring plans for joint ventures or acquisitions <unk> <unk> has called top managers of companies rumored as potential raiders among them <unk> - <unk> <unk> des <unk> de <unk> and <unk> all based in <unk>
they have all very clearly stated that they have not acquired and are not acquiring shares of <unk> he said n
any raider would find it hard to crack <unk> battlements
a syndicate of shareholders holds just under n of <unk> <unk> <unk> said n and members have agreed to give one another the right of first refusal should they sell any <unk> shares
aside from <unk> de <unk> and <unk> the syndicate includes <unk> <unk> a belgian savings bank and various family interests
a <unk> spokesman confirmed that the giant belgian holding company would be willing to raise its stake in <unk> should a raider seek control
asahi officials could n't be reached for comment
even without bid talk this year surge in prices for <unk> real estate has excited interest in <unk>
the company says n those holdings constitute the third - biggest real - estate portfolio in <unk>
with the dust settling from the failed coup attempt in <unk> one of the many lingering questions n the <unk> administration will ponder is this is the <unk> <unk> <unk> staff big enough and does it have enough clout to do its job of coordinating foreign policy
<unk> <unk> national security adviser <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> came into office in <unk> intent on making the <unk> staff leaner and more disciplined than it had been during the <unk> administration
<unk> <unk> was a member of the <unk> <unk> which investigated the <unk> - <unk> affair
he was all too aware of how a large inadequately supervised <unk> staff had spun out of control and nearly wrecked <unk> <unk> second term
so following both the style n he pursued as <unk> <unk> national security adviser and the recommendations of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has pruned the <unk> staff and tried to ensure that it sticks to its assigned tasks namely gathering the views of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and intelligence community serving as an honest broker in distilling that information for the president and then making sure n presidential decisions are carried out
the <unk> <unk> specifically said that the <unk> staff should be small and warned against letting energetic self - starters like <unk> . <unk> . <unk> <unk> strike out on their own rather than leaving the day - to-day execution of policies to the <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk>
however the <unk> episode has raised questions about whether the <unk> staff is sufficiently big diverse and powerful to coordinate <unk> policy on tough issues
during the coup attempt and its aftermath <unk> staffers were stretched very thin says one senior administration official
it a very small shop
<unk> <unk> does n't plan to increase the staff right now but is weighing that possibility the official adds <unk>
the <unk> staff does n't have the horsepower that i believe <unk> is required to have an effective interagency process says <unk> <unk> a former <unk> aide who now runs the <unk> for <unk> <unk> a conservative <unk> think - tank
the problem with this administration i think n is that by design it has greatly diminished both in a physical sense and in a procedural sense the role of the <unk>
the <unk> <unk> <unk> itself was established in <unk> because policy makers sensed a need in an increasingly complex world for a formal system within the <unk> <unk> <unk> to make sure that communications flowed smoothly between the president and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and intelligence agencies
by law the council includes the president vice president and secretaries of state and defense
in practice the director of central intelligence and chairman of the <unk> chiefs of <unk> also serve as unofficial members
but the size shape and role of the <unk> staff have been left for each president and his national security adviser to decide
that task is one of <unk> perennial problems
in the <unk> <unk> <unk> the size of the <unk> staff of professional officers is down to about <unk> from about <unk> in <unk> administration officials say n
administration officials insist that the size of the staff was n't a problem during the <unk> crisis
but one clear problem during the coup attempt was that the <unk> staffer most experienced in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was gone
he had just resigned at least in part because of a feud with <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> over the administration policy on <unk> and support for <unk> <unk> rebels
the absence of <unk> <unk> underscored the possible inadequacy of the current <unk> staff
both <unk> <unk> and his deputy <unk> <unk> are experts in u.s.-soviet affairs
<unk> <unk> is particularly well - versed in arms control and <unk> <unk> has spent years studying soviet politics and society
both have become confidants of <unk> <unk>
but neither has an extensive background in <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> or <unk>
in those areas the role of <unk> staffers under them therefore have become more important
<unk> <unk> knows as well as anyone that one of the biggest dangers n he faces is that <unk> staffers working in relative anonymity will take over policy - making and operational tasks that are best left to bigger and more experienced <unk> <unk> and <unk> bureaus
but just as every previous <unk> adviser has <unk> <unk> now will have to mull at what point the <unk> staff becomes too lean and too restrained
<unk> wholesale prices in the first <unk> days of <unk> fell n from the previous <unk> days but rose n from a year ago the <unk> of <unk> said <unk>

<unk> <unk> who at the time was the marketing director for <unk> in <unk> <unk> admitted participating in a scheme <unk> to bribe <unk> <unk> the <unk> official
<unk> <unk> who left the <unk> in <unk> pleaded guilty earlier this year to related conspiracy bribery and tax - evasion charges
the bribery scheme took place between <unk> and <unk> according to documents filed by prosecutors in connection with <unk> <unk> guilty plea in federal district court in <unk> <unk>
<unk> merged with <unk> <unk> to become <unk> <unk> in late <unk>
court documents filed by prosecutors indicate <unk> <unk> <unk> tried to steer to <unk> a multimillion dollar contract n to computerize maintenance of certain <unk> electronics equiment
<unk> <unk> among other things illegally provided <unk> <unk> with inside information and documents intended to give <unk> an unfair advantage in the competition the documents said n
<unk> ultimately was eliminated from the competition without receiving the work
documents filed by prosecutors also indicate that <unk> <unk> and his fellow conspirators requested and obtained approval of the scheme from more - senior <unk> officials because the payment which <unk> <unk> requested was so large
<unk> <unk> a former <unk> vice president and <unk> <unk> a former company consultant have admitted participating in this and other bribery schemes

bureaucrats may deserve their bad reputation after all
<unk> <unk> something of a professional defender of government thought <unk> he had a sure - fire winner last summer when he offered n for the best verifiable story of n words or less about how a government bureaucrat helped you
he sent out thousands of news releases from his <unk> <unk> office
he plugged the contest on <unk> <unk> radio show on <unk> <unk> television show and on the <unk> - <unk> cable television network
he talked about it in every speech n he made as he roamed the country promoting his books which dispense handy how - to advice on using government information for fun and profit
<unk> <unk> figured n he would be flooded with entries by now
after all he says n we got like n million bureaucrats
and in addition to the <unk> he has promised the winner a my favorite <unk> plaque and offered each of two runners - up n
so far though <unk> <unk> has received only one entry
to make matters worse the lone nomination came from another bureaucrat a woman from the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> who nominated her boss
<unk> <unk> who is making the rules as he goes has determined that bureaucrats are eligible for nomination by other bureaucrats
but he says n he would prefer to get nominations from rank - and-file folks
he admits that he has n't had much luck generating free publicity for his contest
newspapers including this one have generally ignored his news releases
talk show hosts quickly change the topic
but <unk> <unk> staff is beginning to wonder whether there is n't some larger phenomenon foiling the contest
is the government not helping anybody asks <unk> <unk> an assistant to <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> himself is n't yet prepared to accept that explanation
people hate to write he says
maybe people do n't believe <unk> i want to give this money away
maybe americans are just so annoyed with government that they are n't interested in admitting that bureaucrats come in handy once in a while
if he sponsored a contest on how a bureaucrat mishandled something <unk> <unk> admits <unk> i get n entries
now there an idea
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> - scania <unk> of <unk> broke off talks about a possible alliance after <unk> officials concluded that the cost to modernize <unk> car operations would outweigh the likely return
with the collapse of the talks <unk> european analysts expect <unk> to intensify its pursuit of british luxury car maker <unk> <unk> which is scrambling to fend off a hostile <unk> bid by negotiating a friendly alliance with <unk> <unk> <unk> motors <unk>
<unk> meanwhile is left to continue its search for an ally n to shore up its sagging car business
<unk> said last week n it has had and will continue to have contacts with other manufacturers
among the possible suitors is <unk> <unk> <unk> a analysts said last week
<unk> and <unk> officials declined to elaborate publicly on the announcement <unk> that their negotiations failed to yield an agreement that could make long - term business sense to both parties
individuals close to the <unk> side of the negotiations said late last week that the no . n <unk> auto maker lost interest as it became clear that the swedish auto maker automotive operations had little to offer in the way of image or technology
<unk> originally had seen a <unk> alliance as a way to expand its presence in the <unk> and <unk> luxury car markets
in addition <unk> and <unk> had discussed a possible link between their heavy truck operations
but the talks on a heavy truck alliance apparently did n't go far
some european analysts speculated that officials of <unk> highly profitable <unk> truck operation balked at surrendering any of their autonomy
meanwhile <unk> officials became convinced <unk> they could n't expect to recover the investment n it would require to make <unk> cars competitive in the increasingly crowded luxury market
<unk> problems were underscored <unk> when the company announced that its car division had a n billion kronor n million loss during the first eight months of this year slightly worse than <unk> - <unk> had forecast in its first - half report last month
overall <unk> - <unk> pretax profit during the first eight months of the year plunged <unk> to n billion swedish kronor n million from n billion kronor n million a year earlier
industry analysts in <unk> said n the most likely suitor for <unk> now is <unk>
<unk> and <unk> have worked together in the past in one case developing jointly a new auto chassis that became the foundation of <unk> <unk> model <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
last month <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> his company has had talks with <unk> about a broader alliance
but the talks yielded nothing so advanced that we needed to make a public announcement about it he said
as for <unk> analysts expect <unk> the end of the <unk> play will allow the <unk> auto maker to focus its resources on the intensifying struggle with <unk> for a stake in <unk>
the failure of the <unk> talks makes it even more crucial for <unk> to be victorious in the <unk> contest said <unk> <unk> european auto industry analyst at <unk> - <unk> <unk> in <unk>
<unk> faces an uphill fight for <unk> however
<unk> executives said last week n they expect to have a friendly alliance with <unk> wrapped up by the end of the month
<unk> meanwhile is hosting a delegation of members of the british <unk> who are touring the auto maker headquarter operations in <unk>
a <unk> spokesman said <unk> the visit is n't connected to the <unk> situation
but <unk> clearly views <unk> as a prize worth fighting for since the company gilded brand image would give <unk> a badly needed leg up in the high end of the luxury markets in both <unk> and the <unk>
last week <unk> encountered a setback in its effort to broaden its <unk> luxury offerings when it was forced to abandon a four - year-old effort to market its <unk> - built <unk> sedan in the <unk> as a luxury import under the <unk> brand name
so despite the <unk> - <unk> romance analysts say <unk> <unk> by last <unk> had boosted its <unk> holding to about <unk> of the luxury auto maker shares outstanding from <unk> early last week
about n million <unk> shares changed hands in active trading on <unk> stock exchange <unk> and <unk> shares moved up n pence to <unk> pence n

ah the glamour of professional sports
for <unk> <unk> losing his quarterback temporarily was just the latest in a string of setbacks that has beset the <unk> <unk> and this year much of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
once fat and happy the cowboys now are losing games fans and money
last year the team ended up n million in the red on n million in revenue
it has some of the highest costs in the league
its attendance is off n from six years ago
at the very least <unk> <unk> who cultivates the society circuit as eagerly as his bench can take comfort in one fact these days he is n't alone
nearly half the owners of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> teams are losing money the result of flat attendance aging stadiums and more than anything skyrocketing salaries for star players like <unk> <unk>
last year the top n players on each <unk> team took home an average <unk> a figure comparable to baseball and higher than in basketball
first - round draft picks have done even better average salaries and bonuses for them rose to <unk> this year up n from <unk>
it a vicious circle says <unk> <unk> <unk> owner of the <unk> <unk>
one team pays so much and the other pays more
we just do n't have that kind of income stream
all this is causing convulsions in professional football
owners largely complacent in the past are now almost desperately looking for ways <unk> to lower costs and raise revenue embracing some revolutionary ideas in the process
<unk> not intentionally the <unk> <unk> <unk> has come to represent this new breed of owner
shortly after buying n of the team from <unk> <unk> <unk> for n million and mindful of the cowboys ragged bottom line the <unk> <unk> <unk> set about his own round of team cuts
first he unceremoniously sacked <unk> <unk> the legendary coach who took the cowboys to five <unk> <unk> and <unk> consecutive winning seasons
in <unk> <unk> <unk> has a standing just shy of sainthood
<unk> - <unk> sentiment flooded the local press a crude obnoxious hick said one writer a real oink said another who in the hell does he think n he is wrote a third
for <unk> <unk> it was just the beginning
he quickly cut the team bloated administrative staff by half shut down a <unk> - owned dance academy and in <unk> announced plans to sell <unk> <unk> the team <unk> practice camp and the most lavish training facility in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> calls the ranch the <unk> of <unk>
it is a maze of halls that connects film rooms elaborate spas and weight - training centers that testify to a richer more free - spending era
he likes to tell the yarn of how he got lost on the expansive ranch during an early visit took refuge in an office and called the front desk for help
i said somebody come get me
i at extension n
with a new day dawning on the sport <unk> <unk> does n't see a place for this sort of luxury
it just not cost efficient he says
the place costs nearly n million a year to maintain
when he sells it he says the <unk> will move to a more practical read affordable grass practice field near <unk> <unk>
and as for <unk> <unk> well in <unk> <unk> mind he had played out his winning years
after posting losing seasons in each of the last three years the cowboys needed a change he says n
<unk> has long been <unk> <unk> passion both on and off the field
an <unk> native he started at guard on the undefeated <unk> <unk> of <unk> team that won a national championship
after college he worked at his father insurance company in <unk> <unk> and in <unk> led an aborted attempt to buy the <unk> <unk> <unk>
years later with cash from the sale of the insurance company he founded <unk> <unk> <unk> an oil and gas exploration company based in <unk> <unk>
so it was n't surprising that <unk> <unk> returned to his <unk> roots when he went looking for a replacement for <unk> <unk>
he tapped <unk> <unk> a teammate on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> squad and the head coach at the <unk> of <unk> where he led the hurricanes to five winning seasons and a national championship in <unk>
whatever <unk> <unk> talents in the hearts and minds of many <unk> fans he is no <unk> <unk>
seven games and after a loss to the <unk> <unk> <unk> yesterday seven losses into the season the new cowboys are n't doing any better than the old
in fact the last time n they played this badly was in <unk> their opening season
average attendance at their games about n last year continues flat
<unk> <unk> is attacking the problem on several fronts
he continues to reshuffle the team trading famed running back <unk> <unk> to the <unk> vikings this month for a slew of players and future draft picks
to try to draw more fans he has dropped end - zone ticket prices from <unk> to n
but the general trend given rising costs in the league has been to raise prices and <unk> <unk> is expected to eventually follow suit
it simple says <unk> <unk> who owns the <unk> <unk> chiefs and last year raised ticket prices by n to an average n
if we did n't increase prices we be in the red
<unk> <unk> has also beefed up his marketing staff to sell the <unk> luxury suites topping <unk> <unk> his deal with <unk> <unk> included operating rights for the stadium
the suites are air - conditioned have wet bars and plush seating and offer a clear view of the field all for a sale price of <unk> to n million depending on their size and location
<unk> <unk> has been taking prospective suite owners onto the field during practice to let them rub elbows with players and promises those who actually buy one of the rooms an insider look at the team strategy before game time
the sales job seems to be paying off when he bought the team only six of the suites had been sold
today n have
<unk> receipts are only the cowboys second largest source of cash
the biggest is the <unk> contract with national television for broadcast of the league games
last year the cowboys share of that pie came to n million
the team additionally earns between n million and n million for local radio and television broadcast rights
<unk> <unk> is currently trying to jack up the price for those local rights
he is also trying to get more stations in <unk> where the cowboys have a following to pick up the games
<unk> <unk> whose twangy voice and folksy ways belie an intense businessman who works <unk> days is resigned to the hefty salaries n he pays his players these days
he calls the contracts critical to winning in the <unk> and has played his part in the bidding wars
besides signing <unk> <unk> to a sizable contract <unk> <unk> has agreed to pay rookie quarterback <unk> <unk> <unk> million over the next four years
this wage inflation is bleeding the <unk> dry the owners contend
soon only large corporations will be able to afford to buy and run football teams predicts <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> an investment banker with <unk> brothers who handled the <unk> sale
to tackle the problem <unk> owners have proposed setting a rookie wage scale to try to rein in salaries
details of the plan which would go into effect in n are sketchy but each player would apparently be paid a base salary keyed to his position and ability
bonuses would be paid based on playing time and performance
the <unk> players <unk> meanwhile contends that athletes are paid a wage commensurate with their ability to draw fans and that some owners are in financial trouble because of poor business management not players salaries
the owners are trying to boost profit in other ways too
many have launched promotions <unk> to attract new fans and are renegotiating dated stadium contracts
most of the owners must pay up to <unk> of gross ticket sales for leases on stadiums n they say n are either too small or too old
in <unk> for example size is the issue
we have the worst lease in the <unk> contends <unk> <unk> <unk> the president of the <unk> bears and a grandson of <unk> <unk> who founded the <unk> predecessor organization
we in a metro area with millions of <unk> fans and only a small number can be accommodated
when the lease expires in <unk> he says it got to be changed
this year the <unk> also imposed an <unk> limit on teams going into training camp down from <unk> in a move meant to trim payroll costs
and the league is trying to get more for its three - year national network contract which expires after this season
the current contract pays the <unk> <unk> billion
owners say <unk> they expect the league to demand a n increase despite the fact that televised football games have had lackluster ratings
an <unk> spokesman also says n the league will probably expand its offerings to cable tv companies like <unk>
the changes have n't come easy
like the game of professional football the <unk> organization itself is in turmoil
the new breed of team owner <unk> <unk> included has been fighting the <unk> bureaucracy for a greater say in league affairs and the battle has produced a form of organizational gridlock
in <unk> <unk> <unk> owners almost all of them new blocked an effort to install <unk> <unk> as a replacement for retiring league commissioner <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is perceived by some owners as a standard - bearer for the <unk> <unk>
earlier this month another effort to choose a commissioner failed
the owners meet again tomorrow
for his part <unk> <unk> says n he in the business for the long haul and his work style seems to support that
he puts in busy six - day weeks excluding game days and on one recent afternoon fielded questions in the course of an hour from a tv producer his luxury - suite marketing manager a disgruntled customer and a roomful of <unk> reporters
to keep his schedule on track he flies two personal secretaries in from <unk> <unk> to augment his staff in <unk>
when i made this investment i made it on a lifetime basis he explains
i not here to make money by reselling the team later on
while the cowboys may not be the best investment now i do n't accept n they ca n't be in the future
besides to a large extent <unk> <unk> may already be getting what he wants out of the team even though it keeps losing
owning the cowboys has bought him entree to a glitzy life that drilling for oil in <unk> just did n't provide
there is the new private jet the platoon of assistants invitations to the best parties and television appearances on shows such as <unk> <unk> <unk>
a few weeks ago <unk> <unk> even entertained <unk> <unk> in his private suite at <unk> <unk>
you in the catbird seat every day in this job he says
how interestingly clever of <unk> <unk> to use the form of pretend advocacy journalism to explain his perception of days of rage in his television critique <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
he chastises <unk> <unk> - <unk> for her inept presentation of advocacy journalism judging her project as intellectually slipshod
was not the title very clear
one example n he gives she did n't ask why the palestinian children are soldiers throwing stones
really now did she have to ask
were not the pictures and happenings which have been continuing news headlines answers enough
<unk> <unk> contends that even as propaganda the film fails because it presents only one view
of course the palestinians complain about their treatment of course the israelis feel put upon
but his complaint that days of rage does n't contain balanced comments from israelis about how badly the palestinians are behaving is irrelevant
it like doing a documentary on apartheid and insisting that equal time be given to how terrific white south africans are
this film did emphasize how long the israeli\/palestinian stalemate has existed by tracing the conflict to the days of <unk> <unk> i when the british tried to guarantee both a jewish state and a palestinian state without specifying how it was to be done
well days of rage airing with before - and-after packaging and after repeated delays was a beginning
every issue is multisided
this film attempts to show a side rarely seen in our media
now we must endure a rash of critics who apparently wish to know details of one side only
<unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> wants the <unk> to get special treatment in coping with the across - the-board spending cuts that took effect last week
<unk> <unk> asked <unk> to raise to n billion from n billion the amount of money <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> may shift among the <unk> individual programs projects and activities allowing him to ease the pain that the <unk> - <unk> budget law was intended to inflict
if the request is approved by both the <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> would need only permission from the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> to move the money according to <unk> budget analysts
that would give the <unk> flexibility that no other federal agency has
it simply a way of making the cuts less onerous for defense than they are for domestic programs said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> who said n he would oppose the request
that is n't consistent with the kind of discipline that <unk> - <unk> is supposed to impose he said
the president request did n't indicate how <unk> <unk> would shift the money
a <unk> official said <unk> the request was made to give the department maximum flexibility <unk> to deal with the cuts
last week <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> structured the <unk> billion spending reduction half of which must come from defense to impose a little bit more discipline by applying cuts to each individual program project or activity in the budget
that would give agencies less ability to fudge over things he told n reporters
under the deficit - reduction law <unk> of the <unk> money and <unk> of other agencies money has been canceled
lawmakers are expected to try to restore the funds once a pending deficit - cutting measure has been signed into law
<unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> it completed its purchase of <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> the second - largest unaffiliated independent telephone company in that state
<unk> <unk> said <unk> the acquisition was made in an exchange of its common shares for all the shares of <unk> <unk> but a price was n't disclosed
<unk> is the company first telephone subsidiary in <unk>
since <unk> <unk> <unk> signed letters of intent to purchase three other <unk> firms
a bill that would permit the securities and <unk> <unk> to monitor the financial condition of securities firms holding companies is facing tough opposition from some <unk> <unk> firms which argue that the legislation is unnecessary
the legislation and other issues related to the stock market will be the focus of hearings this week by the <unk> telecommunications and <unk> <unk> and the <unk> securities <unk>
<unk> <unk> the new chairman of the <unk> has n't taken a formal position on the bill which would also require investors to disclose large trades and give the <unk> additional authority during market emergencies
however he recently told the <unk> <unk> <unk> that he believes n the agency should have explicit authority to monitor debt levels at holding companies and affiliates of broker - dealers which are frequently used to issue bridge loans
the bridge loans are intended to provide temporary financing for acquisitions
since such loans are often refinanced through the sale of high - risk high - yield junk bonds the recent woes of the junk - bond market have renewed concerns among regulators about the risks associated with <unk> <unk> firms issuing bridge loans
but some <unk> <unk> executives argue that such fears are unwarranted
in a <unk> <unk> letter to the <unk> securities <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> argued that the fact that no retail brokerage firm failed during the n market crash demonstrates that current rules are adequate
<unk> <unk> whose holding company <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is one of the larger issuers of bridge loans on <unk> <unk> said n it is also concerned that once the <unk> has the power to monitor holding companies it will try to regulate their activities
the proposal while well - intended i think n can be dangerously misleading because the likely consequence would be to weaken rather than strengthen the control n the <unk> has exercised for n years over the financial adequacy and viability of broker - dealers <unk> <unk> - <unk> managing director of <unk> <unk> said in an interview
the bill would divert scarce resources of the commission away from broker - dealers into areas which simply have no way of affecting broker - dealers <unk> <unk> - <unk> said <unk>
sources in the industry and on <unk> <unk> say <unk> a compromise that would placate the industry while addressing the <unk> concerns may be possible
an aide to the <unk> securities <unk> says n some legislators support the concept of risk disclosure but adds nobody is wedded to the language in the bill
<unk> <unk> president of the securities <unk> <unk> said that the securities - industry trade group opposes the bill as it is written but that it is hopeful <unk> a compromise can be reached to achieve the <unk> goals
<unk> <unk> will elaborate on the <unk> position in testimony before the <unk> telecommunications and <unk> <unk> this week a spokesman said n
this letter was inspired by <unk> <unk> <unk> n editorial - page article about <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of drug <unk>
i organized a series of exchanges exhibitions and other continuing projects between cuban and american artists
in any matters between us and the cubans there can be no simplicity consequently i become familiar not only with cuban art and artists but also with cuban bureaucrats and their counterparts in our own government
despite levels of obstruction incompetence and ensuing frustration of mythic proportion these projects all remain in my mind valuable and well worth the effort
there is a simple reason for this the cuban people
let me immediately put limits to whatever nostalgic notions that may intimate
those people to whom i refer are not some heroic indecipherable quantity they are artists critics taxi drivers grandmothers even some employees of the <unk> of <unk> all of whom share a deep belief in the original principles of the <unk> <unk> spelled out in terms such as equality among all members of the society reverence for education and creative expression universal rights to health and livelihood housing etc
in fact the generation of painters growing into maturity right now works with such profoundly held humanist assumptions and such passionate commitment to moral and ethical principles that it makes <unk> <unk> famous linkages of art idealism and revolution seem modest
it is on behalf of these people and out of my real respect for them that i am responding to <unk> <unk> opinions of their country
the <unk> trial in <unk> with its revelations of deeply rooted and widespread corruption and the summary trial and execution was extremely disturbing to everyone who has ever considered himself a friend of <unk>
however unacceptable though those occurrences may have been they still provide no excuse for wholesale departures from truth
<unk> <unk> should make distinctions among <unk> the army and the cuban people
they are not interchangeable since they are motivated to act based on their own circumstances
it is naivete to equate a government policies with the will of the people as we well know and it is even worse folly to merge the clearly divergent agendas of <unk> and the military and the state bureaucracy
<unk> <unk> is also annoyed that <unk> <unk> has resisted collaboration with <unk> officials even though by his own account that collaboration has been devised essentially as a mechanism for acts directly hostile to the cuban regime such as facilitating defections
i think it a little disingenuous to be surprised that <unk> does n't invite the <unk> <unk> <unk> to violate the jurisdiction of the cuban government over its own territory
we badly need to follow fact rather than the rhetoric of conventional wisdom
without this basic level of attention to reality our policies on <unk> will continue to be as counterproductive as they have for n years
from my own point of view given the qualities of humanity creativity and warm spirit in which the cuban people excel we deny ourselves access to things n we hold dear and which seem to run in such short supply these days
there is no rational justification for such behavior
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> recently reported third - quarter earnings which were mistakenly shown in the <unk> earnings surprises table in last <unk> edition to be lower than the average of analysts estimates
<unk> <unk> <unk> did n't adjust one analyst estimate for a stock split which therefore was artificially high
<unk> third - quarter net income of n cents a share actually was <unk> higher than the adjusted average of estimates
investors bailed out of <unk> <unk> <unk> bonds in droves last week driving prices lower and boosting yields
one bond trader estimated that more than n million of <unk> <unk> <unk> general obligation bonds were put up for sale <unk> alone
while that represents a small percentage of the city public debt outstanding <unk> selling followed a weeklong effort to unload the bonds by a broad spectrum of institutional and individual investors
i never seen so many <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> up for sale said another trader
every broker has blocks of every size and maturity
municipal bond analysts said n the sell - off was triggered by concerns about the city financial health rumors of a n million bond offering coming soon and political uncertainty
a spokesman for the city would n't confirm the size of the bond issue but did say that a general obligation offering is in the works and should be priced sometime in the next two weeks before the <unk> mayoral election
general obligation bonds are backed by the city overall revenues and credit
although many investors were aware that a bond offering was being scheduled many expected a much smaller amount of bonds to be sold
the fact that the city will issue such a large amount of debt was interpreted as a sign that <unk> <unk> budgetary problems are more serious than had been expected
<unk> <unk> one of the nation largest issuers of tax - exempt bonds sold n million of municipal bonds just a few weeks ago
there have been reports for months that the city economy is weakening as the <unk> n stock market crash continues to make itself felt
the recent sharp stock market decline exacerbated those concerns
meanwhile tax revenues are falling while the city spending needs are expanding
rumors persisted last week that <unk> <unk> credit ratings single - a from <unk> investors <unk> <unk> and single - a-minus from <unk> <unk> <unk> are at risk
the weakness in <unk> <unk> <unk> bonds follows a warning from <unk> <unk> state <unk> <unk> <unk> that the <unk> crash seriously weakened the city economy
in a study the comptroller said the city glory days are over
<unk> <unk> warned mayoral candidates to be prepared for limited options and constraints on service increases n to address the city problems in the next few years due to the now - evident weakening in the <unk> <unk> <unk> economy
<unk> <unk> <unk> revised financial plan due out later this month is expected to include measures n to balance the city n billion budget
at present analysts project a budget gap on the order of n million to n million for the fiscal year ending <unk> <unk> <unk> although the city own budget analysts project a narrower deficit
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> deputy director of finance said that investors concerns about the city financial health are unwarranted given our proven ability to manage ourselves
he charges the city critics with spreading unfounded emotional rhetoric
there are also questions about whether a new and inexperienced mayor can manage the city through what could become a financial crisis
the leading contender for the mayoral office <unk> <unk> <unk> has been criticized recently for the way n he handled his personal financial affairs
and the controversy has led to uncertainty about the outcome of the election
until last week <unk> <unk> was considered a shoo - in
the market can adjust to good news or bad news but uncertainty drives people wild said <unk> <unk> <unk> chief executive of <unk> <unk> <unk> a securities firm that specializes in the municipal market
until last week everyone felt certain n they knew the outcome of the election
now there have been a number of questions raised
last week yields on long - term <unk> <unk> <unk> general obligation bonds jumped half a percentage point
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> bonds due n for example were quoted late <unk> at a price n to yield n compared with n <unk>
as the yield on <unk> <unk> general obligation bonds rose the <unk> <unk> <unk> general obligation index the mostly widely followed gauge of the tax - exempt market held steady at n in the week ended <unk> n
<unk> <unk> <unk> encountered another setback <unk> when its <unk> <unk> - based affiliate <unk> <unk> <unk> filed for protection under chapter n of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> also said <unk> <unk> <unk> its president and chief executive and <unk> <unk> a director both resigned
neither could be reached for comment
earlier this month <unk> <unk> <unk> billion agreement to acquire <unk> <unk> <unk> collapsed because of a dispute over a n million letter of credit n the australian operator of television stations and resorts was to have supplied as security in the transaction
<unk> <unk> had been the de facto head of <unk> for months
<unk> <unk> a producer and distributor of television programs most noted for its co - production of the hit miniseries <unk> <unk> said <unk> it filed for chapter n protection after <unk> <unk> failed to provide it with n million owed to <unk> <unk> in connection with the distribution of the <unk> <unk> it to <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is <unk> owned by <unk> <unk> and said n it relies on the australian company for funding its working capital requirements
after the announcement of the bankruptcy filing <unk> <unk> stock sank <unk> in over - the-counter trading to close at <unk> on heavy volume of more than n million shares
the stock traded as high as n this past summer
<unk> <unk> executive vice president and chief financial officer of <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> was forced to file for protection to avoid going into default under its agreement with <unk>
the n million payment was due <unk> n and the deadline for default was <unk> n
<unk> <unk> said if <unk> had defaulted it could have been required to repay n million in debt under its loan agreements
<unk> on <unk> said that as a result of <unk> failure to make the required payment it was terminating the distribution agreement on the <unk> <unk> it to <unk> as well as other <unk> properties
<unk> <unk> was saying as recently as last weekend that they would take care of the situation
they continued to represent that to the board said <unk> <unk>
we were reassured n they would stand behind the company
<unk> <unk> said <unk> both <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> had attempted to secure a loan that would allow the company to make the n million payment but the request was turned down by an unidentified lender on <unk> n
at that point he said <unk> <unk> <unk> stated <unk> it would endeavor to arrange the financing
however a <unk> <unk> spokesman said n his firm had never promised or guaranteed to make the payment
in a prepared statement from <unk> the company also said that following the breakdown of the <unk> talks it had been re - evaluating its position as a significant shareholder and a substantial creditor of <unk> <unk> and had resolved to minimize the degree of further loans to <unk> <unk> in excess of that previously made
the <unk> <unk> spokesman added that his company had opposed the chapter n filing
he said n the company believed <unk> <unk> <unk> financial problems could have been resolved by other means
the report of the bankruptcy filing stunned <unk> executives and investors
it a shocker said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman of <unk> <unk> <unk> a brokerage firm that has an investment in <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> was going to pay more than n billion for <unk> and then they could n't come up with the far smaller sum of n million
<unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> the former president resigned for personal reasons and that <unk> <unk> an attorney resigned because his participation in evaluating the company role in buying <unk> was no longer necessary
<unk> <unk> was a director of the company and a predecessor firm since <unk>
the announcement seemed to further damp prospects that talks between <unk> <unk> and <unk> might be revived
it understood that <unk> recently contacted <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which made two failed bids for the movie studio to see if the company was still interested
however we are n't currently doing anything
it is n't a current topic of conversation at the company said <unk> <unk> chairman and chief executive officer of the <unk> <unk> unit of <unk> <unk>
financial printer <unk> <unk> said <unk> it formed a business translation service which will provide legal financial and other services in most major languages including <unk> <unk> and russian
<unk> <unk> <unk> strongly denied playing any role in the <unk> <unk> stock - price free fall
<unk> <unk> vice minister for international affairs said n the ministry did n't in any way suggest to japanese banks that they stay out of the <unk> <unk> leveraged buy - out
the ministry has never even suggested that japanese banks be cautious about leveraged buy - outs in general <unk> <unk> said <unk>
there are no facts behind the assertions that we sent any kind of signal he declared in an interview
the comments were the ministry first detailed public statement on the subject and reflect the ministry concern that foreigners will think n <unk> is using its tremendous financial power to control events in foreign markets
a number of accounts of the events leading to the <unk> point drop in <unk> <unk> stock prices on <unk> <unk> accused the ministry of pulling the plug on the <unk> deal for one reason or another
<unk> <unk> said n the most n the ministry had ever done was ask japanese banks about the status of their participation in one previous <unk> leveraged buy - out
the ministry inquired about that deal which <unk> <unk> declined to identify because the large presence of japanese banks in the deal was being strongly criticized in the <unk> <unk> and it was necessary for us to grasp the situation
he said <unk> the inquiry was n't made in a way that the banks could have interpreted as either encouraging or discouraging participation and he added that none of the japanese banks changed their posture on the deal as a result of the inquiry
<unk> <unk> also said n some japanese banks were willing to participate in the <unk> financing up to the very end which would suggest at the very least that they were n't under orders to back out
in general <unk> <unk> said japanese banks are becoming more independent in their approach to overseas deals
each japanese bank has its own judgment on the profits and risks in that <unk> deal he said
they are becoming more independent
it a sound phenomenon
<unk> <unk> <unk> is one japanese bank that decided not to participate in the first <unk> proposal
a <unk> <unk> spokesman denied that the finance ministry played any part in the bank decision
we made our own decision he said
still <unk> <unk> may have a hard time convincing market analysts who have rightly or wrongly believed that the ministry played a role in orchestrating recent moves by japanese banks
all week there has been much speculation in financial circles in <unk> and abroad about the <unk> real position
bank analysts say n ministry officials have been growing increasingly concerned during the past few months about japanese banks getting in over their heads
the ministry thinks n the banks do n't know what they are doing that they have very little idea how to cope with risk said one foreign bank analyst who asked not to be identified
the ministry wants to see the japanese banks pull in their horns on leveraged buy - outs he added n
although some of the japanese banks involved in the first proposed bid for <unk> bowed out because they found the terms unattractive observers here say n they have a hard time believing that commercial considerations were the only reason
japanese banks are under political pressure as well the analyst said <unk>
moreover analysts point out that japanese banks have a reputation for doing deals that are n't extremely profitable if they offer the chance to build market share cement an important business relationship or curry favor with powerful bureaucrats
clearly some financial authorities are concerned about the japanese banks role in leveraged buy - outs
at a news conference this week <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> cautioned banks to take a prudent stance regarding highly leveraged deals
despite <unk> <unk> statements it is the <unk> <unk> not the central bank that makes policy decisions
while recent events may cool some of the leveraged buy - out fever japanese banks are n't likely to walk away from the game
despite the risks the deals can be an attractive way for japanese banks to increase their presence in the <unk> market bank analysts say n
flush with cash at home but with fewer customers to lend to leading banks are eager to expand overseas
jumping in on big deals is a high profile way n to leapfrog the problem of not having a strong retail - banking network
<unk> national tobacco company known for making brown - tobacco cigarettes such as <unk> and <unk> is branching out
concerned by dipping demand for its traditional products it is moving not only into blonde cigarettes but also into electronic car - parking payment cards n to be sold in neighborhood tobacco stores
brown tobacco in <unk> is a more pungent stronger grade than the lighter grade or blonde tobacco used in so - called american - style cigarettes
we are n't <unk> <unk> <unk> . says <unk> de <unk> chairman of government - owned <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> des <unk> <unk> <unk> known as <unk>
he says that because <unk> profits are limited by government - controlled cigarette prices he does n't have the cash n to diversify as heavily into food and drink as the <unk> concern has done
last year for example <unk> net profit soared <unk> to n million french francs n million on sales of <unk> <unk> billion a n profit margin
instead he said in an interview n he is looking for ways <unk> to exploit <unk> network of n tobacco agents most of them cafes
while <unk> does n't own the french tabacs its close alliance with them offers distribution possibilities
one proposal is to introduce a new payment system for parking in <unk>
instead of paying for parking by putting money in the existing machines which deliver little paper receipts drivers would be able to buy electronic cards in local tobacco shops
once activated the card would sit in the car window showing traffic wardens how much time the motorist could remain
when the motorist returned to his car he could turn the card off and if it showed time remaining save it for later
<unk> is a partner in the project which was developed by <unk> <unk> using japanese technology
<unk> and <unk> currently are negotiating with city officials for the right to begin service
and <unk> is considering further diversification
it wanted to buy <unk> <unk> <unk> french cracker subsidiary <unk> in hopes of selling its products in tobacco stores but lost the bidding to food group <unk> <unk>
it currently is considering bidding for <unk> <unk> <unk>
and it retains an interest in acquiring candies and other articles that might be sold in tobacco shops
it also is trying to shore up its tobacco business
<unk> - tobacco cigarettes such as <unk> now make up just n of the french tobacco market half the level of about two decades ago
while <unk> retains a manufacturing monopoly in <unk> it is being hurt by rising imports and from waning cigarette demand
so <unk> has introduced blonde cigarettes under the <unk> label and intends to relaunch the unsuccessful <unk> blondes in new packaging similar to the slide - packs used by brown - tobacco <unk>
the aim says <unk> de <unk> is to win market share from imported cigarettes and to persuade smokers who are switching to blonde cigarettes to keep buying french
when the <unk> <unk> upheld <unk> abortion restrictions last <unk> the justices almost certainly did n't have drunk driving trespassing and false imprisonment on their minds
but the n ruling may have had as much immediate impact on those activities especially trespassing as on abortion rights
the decision <unk> vs. <unk> <unk> services illustrates how <unk> <unk> rulings often have a ripple effect spreading into areas of law and policy that were n't part of the actual cases decided and that never were contemplated by the justices
in the <unk> case unforeseen consequences may have arisen because the high court reinstated the preamble of the state n abortion law
the preamble says that human life begins at conception and that unborn children have rights protected by the <unk>
last year a federal appeals court in <unk> <unk> said <unk> the preamble was unconstitutional citing an earlier <unk> <unk> ruling that states ca n't justify stricter abortion curbs by changing the definition of when life begins
but the <unk> <unk> concluded that it was premature to rule on the constitutionality of the preamble because the definition of human life had n't yet been used to restrict abortion services
the high court majority said n it was up to the state courts for now to decide whether the definition has any bearing on other state laws
already local <unk> judges have relied on the restored preamble in two separate cases to throw out criminal trespass charges against anti - abortion demonstrators who blocked access to <unk> <unk> services an abortion clinic in <unk> <unk>
the protesters said <unk> their actions were justified by the desire to save the lives of unborn children
under a <unk> <unk> law persons accused of some crimes including trespassing may offer a defense that their actions were justified as an emergency measure n to avoid an imminent public or private injury
relying on the preamble statement that a fetus is an unborn child the two <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> judges in <unk> accepted the justification that the abortion clinic protesters were trying to save lives
in another case a protester <unk> <unk> was convicted of trespass before the <unk> <unk> <unk> ruling
last week when her appeal was argued before the <unk> <unk> of appeals her lawyer also relied on the preamble
the effect of the <unk> <unk> <unk> opinion is that it left room n for grass to grow in the cracks of <unk> vs. <unk> and i think n this is one of the cracks said <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> lawyer who represented <unk> <unk> and the other <unk> <unk> protesters
<unk> vs. <unk> was the <unk> <unk> <unk> decision that recognized a woman right to abortion
<unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> lawyers for <unk> says that <unk> if abortion foes succeed in using the preamble to escape prosecution for trespass this will shut down abortion in <unk>
there no risk to the protesters and you ca n't keep an abortion clinic open if there are n people standing outside every day
that would be an ironic result of a case in which the <unk> <unk> expressly stopped short of overruling <unk> vs. <unk>
in two other cases the possible consequences of the <unk> <unk> ruling appear even more unintended
in one the lawyer for a <unk> resident of <unk> <unk> who was charged with drunk driving argued that his client should be treated as a <unk> adult because his actual age should be calculated from conception not from birth
in <unk> those caught drinking and driving between the ages of <unk> and <unk> may have their licenses revoked for one year while those n or older suffer only a n suspension
a <unk> <unk> judge rejected the motion but <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> lawyer says <unk> he has appealed
and in a case filed in federal court in <unk> a lawyer is arguing that <unk> authorities are wrongfully imprisoning the fetus of a pregnant woman who is in jail for theft and forgery
in terms of sheer brutality the somali regime of <unk> <unk> may rank as <unk> . n in the world
the only reason that <unk> remains in obscurity is numbers a sparsely populated wasteland of n million people spread out over an expanse nearly the size of <unk>
the <unk> dictatorship simply is limited in the amount of people n it can torture and kill
beheading small children stabbing elderly people to death raping and shooting women and burying people alive are just a few of the grisly activities that the somali armed forces have been engaged in over the past two years
up to n somalis have escaped to the relative safety of marxist <unk> because of the behavior of <unk> <unk> troops
in the port of <unk> for example hundreds of men of the rival <unk> clan were rounded up in <unk> <unk> imprisoned and then taken out at night in groups of five to n men to be executed without any judicial process whatsoever
guns were never used each man was stabbed to death with a large knife
the horrific details are only now emerging from a painstakingly documented report based on hundreds of interviews with randomly selected refugees
the study was done by <unk> <unk> a consultant to the <unk> <unk> <unk> who has years of experience in investigating human - rights abuses on both sides of the left - right ideological divide
what gives these events particular significance however is the fact that they are part of a wider drama affecting the strategic positions of both the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> on the horn of <unk>
not since the late <unk> has the horn been so up for grabs as it has suddenly become in just the past few weeks
<unk> <unk> rule is crumbling fast
mutinies wrack his armed forces really just an armed gang which control less than half the country
inflation is at record levels
desperate he has called in the libyans to help fight the rebels of the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the north which is only one of several groups picking away at the regime in the capital of <unk>
seventy years old and a self - declared scientific socialist <unk> <unk> has a power base composed only of his minority <unk> clan that according to observers is narrowing
the <unk> interest in <unk> consists of a single runway at the port of <unk> which <unk> military aircraft have the right to use for surveillance of the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk>
that strip of concrete is backed up by a few one - story air - conditioned shacks where a handful of american nationals buttressed by imported food cold soft drinks and back issues of <unk> <unk> maintain radio contact with the outside world
in the past two years the desert behind them has become a land of mass executions and utter anarchy where due to <unk> <unk> brutality and ineptitude nobody is any longer in control
as long as the rival <unk> - backed regime of <unk> <unk> <unk> held a total gridlock over neighboring <unk> the <unk> was forced to accept that lonely <unk> runway as a distant no . n to the soviets array of airfields next door
but due to dramatic events on the battlefield over the past few days and weeks those soviet bases may soon be as endangered and as lonely as the american runway
on <unk> n i wrote on these pages about the killing and capturing of n ethiopian soldiers by eritrean and tigrean guerrillas
recently in <unk> province in the center of <unk> tigrean forces have killed wounded and captured an additional n government troops
think what these numbers mean considering the headline space devoted to hundreds of deaths in <unk> a small country of little strategic importance
tigrean armies are now <unk> miles north of <unk> <unk> threatening the town of <unk> which would cut off <unk> <unk> capital from the port of <unk> through which all fuel and other supplies reach <unk> <unk>
as a result <unk> <unk> has been forced to transfer thousands of troops from <unk> just to hold the town thereby risking the loss of even more territory in <unk> only to keep the tigreans at bay
<unk> <unk> is in an increasingly weak position half his army is tied down defending the northern city of <unk> from the eritreans
the weaker he gets the more he turns toward the <unk> for help
while the tigreans are communists like the eritreans they are among the most anti - soviet guerrillas in the world having suffered more than a decade of aerial bombardment by the <unk> - supplied <unk> air force
what this all means in shorthand is that soviet dominance in <unk> is collapsing as fast as <unk> <unk> regime in <unk> is
the <unk> therefore has a historic opportunity both to strike a blow for human rights in <unk> and to undo the superpower flip - flop of the late n on the <unk> of <unk>
back to <unk>
the <unk> <unk> to its credit has already begun distancing itself from <unk> <unk> evinced by its decision to publish the <unk> report which the press has ignored
what more the <unk> has suspended n million in military aid and n million in economic aid
but this is not enough
because the <unk> is still perceived to be tied to <unk> <unk> when he goes the runway could go too
considering how tenuous the security of that runway is anyway the better option both morally and strategically would be for the <unk> administration to blast the regime publicly in terms clear enough for all influential somalis to understand
it is a certainty that <unk> <unk> days are numbered
the <unk> should take care however that its own position in the country does not go down with him
nobody is sure what will come next in <unk> or whom the successor might be
but as one expert tells me whoever it is will have to work pretty damn hard to be worse than <unk>
while the <unk> <unk> positions itself for the post - <unk> period in <unk> it should continue to back former <unk> <unk> well - intentioned role as a mediator between <unk> <unk> and the eritrean guerrillas in <unk> while concomitantly opening up channels of communications with the tigrean rebels through neighboring <unk>
ethiopian politics are the most sophisticated secretive and byzantine in all of black <unk>
remember that it took <unk> <unk> many months in what became known as the creeping coup to topple <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk>
there is simply no way to engineer a succession covertly as is sometimes possible elsewhere on the continent
but the <unk> has one great advantage the soviets are universally loathed throughout ethiopia for what they did to the country this past decade famine and all
it not just in <unk> <unk> where the march of events is finally on the <unk> side but on the horn of <unk> as well
the only <unk> liability in the region is what remains of the link to <unk> <unk> and that should be cut fast
<unk> <unk> author of <unk> or starve the wars behind the famine <unk> <unk> <unk> lives in <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> got an n million <unk> contract for missile - launch systems

<unk> is a developer and manager of futures - investment limited partnerships

the rise followed boosts of <unk> in <unk> n in <unk> and <unk> in <unk>
<unk> ability to produce more petroleum than it can sell is beginning to cast a shadow over world oil markets
output from the <unk> of <unk> <unk> countries is already at a high for the year and most member nations are running flat out
but industry and <unk> officials agree that a handful of members still have enough unused capacity to glut the market and cause an oil - price collapse a few months from now if <unk> does n't soon adopt a new quota system to corral its chronic cheaters
as a result the effort by some oil ministers to get <unk> to approve a new permanent production - sharing agreement next month is taking on increasing urgency
the organization is scheduled to meet in <unk> beginning <unk> n
so far this year rising demand for <unk> oil and production restraint by some members have kept prices firm despite rampant cheating by others
but that could change if demand for <unk> oil softens seasonally early next year as some think n may happen
<unk> is currently producing more than n million barrels a day sharply above its nominal self - imposed fourth - quarter ceiling of n million according to <unk> and industry officials at an oil conference here sponsored by the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
at that rate a majority of <unk> <unk> members have reached their output limits they said n
but it is estimated that at least three million barrels a day and possibly as much as seven million barrels a day of spare capacity still exists within <unk>
most is concentrated in five <unk> <unk> countries including his own <unk> <unk> - <unk> <unk> oil minister told the conference <unk>
he puts <unk> current capacity at n million to n million barrels a day
that higher than some other estimates
<unk> <unk> <unk> - <unk> <unk> oil minister recently estimated <unk> capacity at n million barrels a day
either way the overhang is big enough to keep delicately balanced oil markets on edge
even modest amounts of additional output by those with the huge extra capacity and reserves such as <unk> <unk> and <unk> could upset the market
the iraqi oil minister and saudi oil minister <unk> <unk> insisted in their comments to the conference that their countries would act responsibly to maintain a stable market
however in interviews later both ministers stressed that they expect future <unk> quotas to be based mainly on the production capacity and reserves of each member
under that approach countries with the most unused oil capacity would get bigger shares of any future increases in <unk> production ceiling than they would under the current system
if you are already producing at <unk> or <unk> of your capacity what the good to be told n you can produce at <unk> of capacity asked <unk> <unk> - <unk>
at an inconclusive <unk> meeting late last month <unk> oil ministers halfheartedly approved another increase of one million barrels a day in their production ceiling
they doled it out using the existing formula however which meant that even those countries that could n't produce more received higher official allotments
the main effect of the ceiling boost was to legitimize some of the overproduction already coming from the quota cheaters
still there was a breakthrough at <unk>
previously no <unk> member had been willing to accept a reduction in its percentage share of the group total output target or ceiling
but the concept of disproportionate quotas for those with unused capacity advanced there in an iranian proposal was generally endorsed by the ministers
in the end politics got in the way
<unk> accepted <unk> proposal only so long as it was promised production parity with <unk>
and the <unk> <unk> emirates a chronic quota cheater refused to give any guarantee n it would change its ways
but the oil ministers continue to study the plan and it will probably be the basis for discussion at next month meeting
it understood n several compromises already have been worked into the plan
the ceiling would be lifted to n million barrels to provide <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> much higher official quotas while reducing percentage shares of some others
<unk> previous conditions are no longer considered a problem although the <unk> <unk> emirates is still an issue
<unk> <unk> <unk> kingpin also has surfaced as a possible obstacle some <unk> sources said n
insisting on a n share of any ceiling saudi officials have long pressed for the pro rata distribution of increases to all members
in <unk> however they supported <unk> proposal because it would have left the saudi percentage of the <unk> total intact and increased actual saudi volume to nearly n million barrels daily from five million
some of the proposed modifications since however call on <unk> <unk> to give back to the production - sharing pool a token <unk> barrels
though tiny that a reduction in its share
<unk> <unk> the saudi oil minister reiterated here that the kingdom would insist on maintaining its percentage share of <unk> production under any quota revisions
under any circumstances <unk> <unk> should get more rather than less <unk> <unk> said
in a blow to <unk> <unk> jet fighter the french navy for the first time publicly stated its desire to buy <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> n hornets to defend its aircraft carriers
the statement is likely to sharpen the debate within <unk> military establishment over the <unk> which is made by <unk> <unk> <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk>
in an interview in the navy official weekly magazine <unk> <unk> the navy second - in-command <unk> <unk> <unk> said n the navy still intends to buy <unk> rafales as scheduled in the late <unk> and early n century
the air force is to take at least n more
<unk> <unk> said n the navy ca n't wait until n when the naval <unk> becomes available to replace its obsolete fleet of <unk> - made crusaders used since the n to protect carriers from attack
rather than renovate the crusaders which <unk> is proposing to do for around <unk> billion french francs n million <unk> <unk> said n the navy wants to buy used n from the <unk> <unk>
officially the statement is n't an attack on the <unk>
<unk> <unk> said that when the <unk> wear out the navy is prepared to take rafales to replace them
but unofficially senior navy officials sharply criticize the <unk> as an air force plane ill - suited to carrier use
although they never said so publicly they have made no secret of their preference for the n on operational grounds
<unk> <unk> comments are likely to inflame the broader dispute within the military establishment here over the role of <unk>
although government - controlled <unk> still is run by the founder son <unk> <unk> <unk> who has fiercely protected his company independence
the <unk> project is the result of <unk> inability jointly to develop a plane with other countries and french officials question whether the state can continue paying for expensive independent programs
so far <unk> <unk> has resisted pressure to change
what brought the naval issue to a head is that the crusaders are literally falling apart without any immediate plan to replace them
<unk> <unk> a former <unk> squadron leader said that the last other country n to use crusaders the philippines retired its last ones two years ago
a french <unk> crash a few months ago heightened pressure for new planes here
<unk> <unk> rejected dassault proposal to renovate the crusaders saying n the cost was impossible n to estimate
even modernized he said the crusaders represent an obsolete and dangerous protection for the aircraft carriers <unk> <unk> has sent to meet such crises as the wars in <unk> and the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> - <unk> <unk> told a meeting of the <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> that the question of modernizing the crusaders or buying used <unk> is a political decision that he will make in due time

securities analysts many of whom scrapped their buy recommendations after seeing <unk> interim figures believe n more jolts lie ahead
fuel and personnel costs are rising and tourism in and through <unk> <unk> remains clouded by <unk> turmoil since the <unk> n killings in <unk>
in addition delivery delays for the first two of as many as <unk> <unk> <unk> that the carrier has ordered have raised costs because personnel had been hired to man the planes
and tough competition in the air - freight market is cutting into an important sideline
there also is concern that once <unk> <unk> reverts to <unk> sovereignty in <unk> <unk> will be forced to play second fiddle to <unk> often - disparaged flag carrier <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> or <unk>
the sense is <unk> we would never be in a position again where everything works for us the way n it did before says <unk> <unk> <unk> commercial director
<unk> <unk> an analyst at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> says n there is n't much n <unk> can do about rising costs for jet fuel <unk> <unk> tight labor market or the strengthening of the local currency which is pegged to the <unk> dollar
these factors are further complicated by the airline push to transform itself from a regional carrier to an international one <unk> <unk> says <unk>
<unk> <unk> expects <unk> profit to grow around <unk> annually this year and next
in <unk> it earned n billion <unk> <unk> <unk> n million on revenue of <unk> $ n billion
<unk> is taking several steps to bolster business
one step is to beef up its fleet
in addition to aircraft from <unk> <unk> <unk> announced earlier this year an order for as many as <unk> <unk> <unk>
the expansion which could cost as much as <unk> <unk> billion over the next eight years will expand the fleet to about n planes by <unk> up from <unk> at the end of last year according to <unk> <unk> <unk> securities <unk>
the fuel - efficient <unk> planes will be used largely to replace <unk> aging fleet of <unk> tristars for regional flights while the <unk> aircraft will be used on long - haul routes to <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> also is moving some of its labor - intensive data - processing operations outside <unk> <unk>
fierce bidding for young employees in <unk> <unk> is pushing up <unk> labor costs by <unk> a year for low - level staff while experienced skilled employees are leaving the colony as part of the brain drain
some jobs already have been moved to <unk> and there are plans to place others in <unk>
<unk> <unk> a spokesman for the airline says n the move is partly aimed at retaining existing staff who are leaving to secure foreign passports ahead of n
<unk> is working to promote <unk> <unk> as a destination worth visiting on its own merits rather than just a stopover
although the <unk> n killings in <unk> have hurt its <unk> flights <unk> other routes have retained high load factors
<unk> <unk> regards promoting <unk> <unk> as an important part of attracting visitors from <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> where the number of people looking to travel abroad has surged
there also has been speculation that <unk> will be among the major private - sector participants in the <unk> <unk> government plans to build a new airport with the carrier possibly investing in its own terminal
<unk> officials decline to comment on the speculation
<unk> <unk> sees alliances with other carriers particularly <unk> recent link with <unk> <unk> <unk> airlines as an important part of <unk> strategy
but he emphasizes that <unk> has n't any interest in swapping equity stakes with the <unk> carrier or with <unk> the west german airline with which it has cooperated for about a decade
analysts believe <unk> <unk> is approached for such swaps by other carriers on a regular basis particularly as the popularity of share exchanges has grown among european carriers
we think <unk> alliances are very important <unk> <unk> says
but we rather put funds into our own business rather than someone else
i not sure <unk> cross - ownership would necessarily make things smoother
in a pattern n it aims to copy in several key <unk> destinations <unk> recently announced plans to serve <unk> <unk> by flying into <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> hub and routing continuing passengers onto a flight on the <unk> carrier
we never have a big operation in the <unk> and they never have one as big as us in the <unk> <unk> <unk> says
but this way <unk> will coordinate good extensions to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
we coordinate on this end to places like <unk> <unk> and <unk>

while a large number of <unk> <unk> companies have reincorporated offshore ahead of n such a move is n't an option for <unk> because it would jeopardize its landing rights in <unk> <unk>

but critics fret that <unk> officials ultimately will be responsible to <unk>
my feeling is <unk> <unk> does n't have a hope in the long run says an analyst who declines to be identified
<unk> would love to keep going but the general sense is n they going to have to do something

the <unk> rescue center offered a very san franciscan response to the disaster
in addition to free massages there was free counseling phone calls and a free shuttle bus to a health club which offered up its showers saunas and hot tubs
the cafeteria offered donated croissants and brie for breakfast and for dinner pasta salad and chocolate mousse torts along with the salmon
this has been a <unk> earthquake for me said resident <unk> <unk> who works in an acupuncturist office
she and some friends are considering offering earthquake victims free yoga classes and aroma therapy massages with scented oils
she finds the response of <unk> residents primarily yuppies and elderly people to the devastation of their homes incredible
people have been very respectful of each other
i do n't know if this would have happened somewhere else
out on the streets some residents of badly damaged buildings were allowed a <unk> scavenger hunt through their possessions
it so weird to have to decide what really important to you said <unk> may
she went first for personal mementos
in post - earthquake parlance her building is a red
after being inspected buildings with substantial damage were color - coded
<unk> allowed residents to re - enter yellow allowed limited access red allowed residents one last entry to gather everything <unk> they could within <unk> minutes
reds and yellows went about their business with a kind of measured grimness
some frantically dumped belongings into pillowcases others threw goods out windows
it did n't help that on <unk> after three days of sunshine it rained
the guys are going for their skis their stereos their personal computers said <unk> <unk> who helped others empty their apartments
the women wanted photo albums a certain brooch kind of sentimental things
he showed an unbroken still - ticking pocket watch that he retrieved for one woman
it belonged to her grandfather
some residents defied orders and returned to red buildings to retrieve goods

a policewoman had to be called in to make her leave the policewoman helped carry out one last load

the <unk> also has become the focal point of city efforts to reunite residents with any pets that may have fled or become lost during the earthquake

the <unk> <unk> <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> to <unk> also has been providing medical care food water and foster homes for quake - displaced animals
the <unk> says n it has received more than n requests for foster homes on behalf of dogs and cats though some people have sought temporary homes for birds and fish
for example one parakeet owner returning home found that her apartment like many others in the <unk> did n't have heat
she can stay there with no heat but for a parakeet that can be deadly says <unk> <unk> animalcare services manager for the <unk>
a warm foster home has been found
the neighborhood around <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> section of <unk> <unk> resembles the crime - ridden deteriorating sections of many inner cities and certainly is n't the sort of area n one would choose to visit
but turn into the shopping center parking lot and one could be in the safe busy mall of a prosperous suburb
only it is safer and busier
over the past year there have been only one burglary three thefts of or from autos no purse - snatchings and one attempted robbery in the mall which opened in late n
a shopping center of similar size in an affluent <unk> <unk> suburb would per year be expected to have eight burglaries n thefts of or from autos and four robberies
the <unk> mall has annual sales of more than n per leasable square foot the figure for a comparable suburban shopping center would be n
three other <unk> shopping centers in the <unk> area are doing almost as well
a successful low - crime mall in a high - crime area violates the more typical inner - city pattern in which commercial areas are taken over by unruly youth gangs and the criminal element with an erosion of the customer base development capital and insurability
major regional and national chain stores are replaced by mom - and-pop operations offering poorer - quality merchandise at higher prices
along with the exodus of shopping opportunities is an exodus of the jobs that the major chains used to provide to community residents
thus there is even more to the <unk> - <unk> <unk> than a good place to shop
this defensible commercial zone becomes for the residents a secure oasis in a barren urban landscape evidence that community decay is not inevitable and that the gangs are not invincible
the center improves the community image to outsiders as well and may help to arrest or even reverse the exodus of capital and investment
an additional benefit is the creation of jobs
this starts in the construction phase through the use of minority contractors and local workers
it continues through the life of the center the <unk> - <unk> <unk> has created n permanent private - sector jobs at a one - time cost in public funds of only n per job
as many of these jobs are filled by local residents who move from the welfare rolls to the tax rolls the <unk> public investment should repay itself in a few years
and that is before consideration of increased state and local revenues from taxes and fees on sales real estate licenses and the like
profits are also plowed back into the community the non - profit <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> receives <unk> of the profits from the <unk> - <unk> <unk> and uses the money to provide moderate and low - cost housing in the community now running into the hundreds of units as well as commercial and industrial development projects
<unk> <unk> director of the mayor <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> says there is no question that <unk> - <unk> had a halo effect on the surrounding neighborhood
what had been a deteriorated area with nothing but wig shops and shoe shops is now experiencing a major upgrading in the housing and commercial stock thanks to a continuously replenished source of revitalization capital that <unk> - <unk> yields
another benefit is that substantial percentages of the proprietors in these centers are minority businessmen and women
in the <unk> <unk> <unk> developed by <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> opposite the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the stores to date have been leased to blacks and n to members of other minority groups
children from the community will have worthier role models than the drug kingpins
so what the catch
primarily that putting one of these inner - city deals together takes time patience breadth of vision and negotiating skills that not all developers possess
security costs are also quite high
one of these centers can involve years of negotiating with numerous public agencies local political leaders and citizen groups and with prospective tenants and sources of financing
suburban deals are not without their delays and complications inner - city deals just have more of them
security at a typical <unk> inner - city center is impressive but unobtrusive
the entire site is enclosed by a <unk> ornamental iron fence with a small number of remote - controlled gates
shrubs and flowers give it a pleasing and non - fortress-like appearance
infrared motion detectors and closed - circuit tv cameras monitor the entire center lighting levels are three to five times the industry standard
the security command post camouflaged as second - story retail space has its own crow nest above the roofs of the other buildings with a panoramic view of the entire center
local law enforcement is present in a sub - station occupying space donated by the center
these features are also used in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> has its own large security force of well - trained and well - paid personnel on round - the-clock duty at each center
security is <unk> to n of the common area charges of these centers vs. an industry average of about <unk>
these security costs are kept off - budget because the centers site acquisition construction and financing costs were reduced by such programs as <unk> <unk> <unk> grants <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> grants tax - free <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> tax write - offs city infrastructure grants and tax increment financing
many of these programs no longer exist or have been severely cut back
however since these centers appear to pay for themselves there is nothing to prevent state and local governments from enacting legislation with similar provisions
many states already have enterprise zones and legislation that combines tax incentives loans and grants to encourage investment in depressed areas with requirements for the hiring of the unemployed and minorities
these programs could be expanded to focus on funds for project planning identifying sources of funds and for acquiring a site and preparing it
combatting crime and the fear of it in inner - city commercial areas should give enterprise zones more success than most have enjoyed to date
with many suburban areas basically overbuilt with shopping centers inner - city areas may represent a major new untapped market for investment
new approaches to mall design and operation make it possible to tap these markets
if the risks and rewards are reasonable developers will respond
government officials who wonder how important it is for them to encourage development in high - risk areas should visit <unk> - <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and decide for themselves

against such a backdrop companies with proven track records of earnings gains of n or so annually have extra appeal
the market will have to look for a new theme now and that theme will be a return to growth declares <unk> <unk> a <unk> analyst
among her <unk> picks are <unk> <unk> and <unk> brands
like many <unk> growth issues they have market values as measured by stock price times shares outstanding of roughly n million to n million
some like to specialize in growth companies whose shares have n't traded publicly very long
these are sometimes dubbed emerging growth companies though they also have expanding - profit track records
while many growth stocks are small not all small stocks have earnings - growth momentum
that an important distinction because some analysts and brokers who perennially predict that small stocks are about to outperform bigger issues may use any spurt in growth issues to help them sell all small stocks

in addition earnings growth took a back seat to cash flow restructuring and takeover potential and breakup value as the preferred stock - picking standards for much of the year
also the smaller growth stocks are n't widely traded and so are harder n to buy and sell quickly than blue chips
as a result <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> stocks most of which are in the <unk> market is up only n for the year while the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has leaped <unk> and the <unk> <unk> has grown <unk>

for bankers and regulators <unk> is looking more like <unk> every day
on <unk> <unk> <unk> - based <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> it expects a net loss of n million for the third quarter of <unk> because of hemorrhaging at its <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> unit
<unk> <unk> said <unk> the unit bludgeoned by <unk> worsening real - estate woes will have a n million loss for the quarter
first <unk> took a huge n million provision for loan losses at the <unk> bank
it charged off an estimated n million of <unk> loans leaving the unit with a reserve for future losses of n million about n of its n million of troubled loans and repossessed real estate
<unk> <unk> made the move under pressure from regulators
the action capped a spurt of grim <unk> banking news for the third quarter and emphatically signaled that <unk> is challenging <unk> long reign as banking busiest graveyard
earlier last week <unk> <unk> <unk> the state largest locally owned banking company reported a n million loss and suspended its dividend
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which has been wrangling with regulators for months over what to do about <unk> moribund <unk> thrift unit suspended its dividend and reported a n plunge in third - quarter net income
<unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> third - quarter credit losses surged a third to n million mainly because of sour <unk> real - estate loans
<unk> <unk> - based <unk> <unk> <unk> took an n million <unk> - related charge
furthermore the regulatory maneuvering behind <unk> <unk> loss suggests <unk> regulators have concluded that lenders reserves are far too low n to absorb their future <unk> losses and are forcing bankers to do something about it
examiners from the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> had been combing through <unk> <unk> real - estate portfolio since last month they first recommended that <unk> <unk> take a provision that was less than the eventual n million third - quarter hit
when <unk> <unk> balked arguing that the figure was too high regulators responded by raising their recommendation to n million
at that point <unk> <unk> decided n it was the better part of valor not to negotiate further said one industry official close to the talks
<unk> <unk> <unk> chief financial officer would n't comment about the details of the negotiations
he said n the provision was n't forced upon us but the regulators made it very clear what they thought <unk> was an appropriate number
the tough regulatory stance portends large future losses especially at the state thrifts
at least six of <unk> <unk> savings and loan institutions have either been taken over by the government conservatorship program or are essentially insolvent they are sitting on enormous unrecognized losses
for example <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which is now in conservatorship had tangible capital - assets minus liabilities of a negative n million at <unk> n
it had a n million loss in the second quarter
yet it still held n million of repossessed real estate for which it maintains no reserves whatsoever
it also had n million of past - due loans its level of reserves against those was n't immediately available though it is believed to be small
the rapid deterioration of the <unk> thrifts only adds to the ever - swelling cost of the government massive thrift bailout officially estimated at about n billion
together the six government - controlled or essentially insolvent <unk> thrifts have tangible capital of a negative n billion foreclosed property of <unk> billion and pastdue loans of n billion
they have no reserves against the real estate and their reserves against the loans are miniscule compared with the levels of reserves n banks are moving to set up
the thrifts had a combined loss of n million in the second quarter
other lenders have been recovering only n cents to n cents on the dollar on foreclosed <unk> property if they can sell it at all
all this havoc is the result of one of the worst busts in <unk> boom - and-bust history compounded by some of the usual suspects in <unk> banking debacles greed fraud and plain bad banking
in the late <unk> and early n lenders and developers poured money into office buildings condominiums and massive tracts of raw desert land confident that <unk> population would grow at annual rates of <unk> to <unk> for years <unk> to come
now annual population growth is running at about <unk> a year some desert tracts bought three years ago for n an acre are being sold at n an acre and <unk> has a seven - year supply of unoccupied office space
it horrible to say but it unfortunate <unk> that earthquake was n't in <unk> it might have knocked out some of our empty buildings said <unk> <unk> a prominent <unk> businessman with interests in real estate banking and many other businesses
many <unk> real - estate experts think n the worst may be yet to come
<unk> <unk> publisher of <unk> <unk> newsletter said n foreclosures have climbed to about <unk> a month just in <unk> <unk> where <unk> is located
that up from about <unk> a month in <unk> and it accelerating so far this month foreclosures are averaging about <unk> a day
it frightening <unk> <unk> said
moreover <unk> <unk> and others said n residential real estate which had remained fairly strong through most of the downturn is beginning to comprise more and more of the foreclosures
and the generally frail condition of <unk> lenders means n there is little capital available in the state to shore up the economy and slow down the slide
it reasonable to say n there is not a solvent s&l in the state and the amount of viable bank capital is very low said <unk> <unk>
we going to see another big wave of failures and defaults between now and year - end
the only thing n a lot of these lenders can get out of their mouth now is pay me in <unk> days
<unk> <unk> had a n million loss in <unk> third quarter mainly from writedowns and reserves connected with its <unk> operations
for the six months ended <unk> <unk> it reported net income of n million or <unk> a share including n million from tax credits and accounting changes
the bank <unk> unit holds about n billion of <unk> <unk> <unk> billion of assets
<unk> <unk> said <unk> the bank expects <unk> real - estate prices which plummeted n over the last year to fall another <unk> before stabilizing
some in <unk> think n that may be optimistic
<unk> <unk> said <unk> its operations outside of <unk> achieved results as expected for the quarter but did n't specify the results
first <unk> stock closed at <unk> down n cents in composite trading <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
since its unsuccessful bid for <unk> <unk> in <unk> the bank has undertaken a major restructuring in an effort to cut costs and boost performance but many industry officials believe n it may be ripe for a takeover bid especially with interstate banking set to begin in <unk> in <unk>
<unk> <unk> said <unk> the problems in <unk> have only increased our resolve to continue to make our restructuring even more effective
separately <unk> <unk> <unk> lowered its ratings on <unk> <unk> <unk> senior debt to double - b from double - b-plus affecting about n million of long - term debt

the ratings service said <unk> the downgrades reflect the continued slide in the company financial condition
a spokesman for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> the concern will be able to withstand the current downturn in <unk> real estate
commercial paper holders have reinvested their funds he said <unk> and consumer deposits have been up in the last few days
<unk> <unk> said <unk> its scientists isolated a molecule which may hold potential as a treatment for disruptions of the immune - system ranging from organ - transplant rejection to allergies and asthma
the molecule is the mouse version of a protein called the <unk> receptor
n is a hormone which directs the growth and function of white blood cells involved in the body immune response
the <unk> receptor on the surface of such cells receives the hormone message to rally the body defense
but in certain conditions such as autoimmune diseases and allergies and transplant rejection doctors would like to damp the immune response so such cells do n't touch off harmful inflammatory reactions or cell destruction
a soluble form of the receptor might turn off a specific part of the immune response without general immune suppression the company said n
the <unk> receptor is one of five such receptors n to be developed and tested by <unk> <unk> a spinoff of <unk> through a proposed n million initial public offering
<unk> will contract with the spinoff to provide the research development and initial testing of the new agents
<unk> will have the option to buy back <unk> shares after five years

analysts expect <unk> earnings to reach roughly <unk> million or <unk> to n a share on sales of n million for <unk> the company third full year in business
that a faster growth rate than reported by <unk> which did n't post similar results until its fourth year in <unk>
but <unk> had achieved that level of sales faster than any previous manufacturing start - up
<unk> performance is closely tied to the burgeoning demand for battery - operated computers the computer industry fastest - growing segment
since its inception <unk> has both benefited from and helped make possible the rapid spread of portable computers by selling storage devices that consume five to n times less electricity than drives used in desktop machines
today <unk> controls an estimated n of the hard - disk drive market for laptop computers

they are going to catch up said <unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk>
both <unk> and <unk> already produce hard - disk drives and <unk> also is studying the field <unk> <unk> said n
but <unk> is n't standing still
yesterday the company introduced four products three of which are aimed at a hot new class of computers called notebooks
each of the three drives uses a mere <unk> watts of power and one weighs just n ounces
most of our competitors are announcing products based on our older products said <unk> <unk> <unk> chief executive officer and founder of the firm that bears his name
we continue to develop products faster than anyone else can
these new products could account for as much as <unk> of the company business in <unk> <unk> <unk> estimated <unk>
we not afraid of obsoleting some of our old stuff to stay ahead of the competition he said
<unk> already is shipping its new drives
last week for instance <unk> introduced its first notebook computer to rave reviews
<unk> is supplying hard - disk drives for the machine which weighs only six pounds and fits in a briefcase
from its inception <unk> has targeted the market for battery - operated machines building hard - disk drives that are smaller and use far less power than those offered by competitors such as <unk>
the availability of these drives in turn boosted demand for laptop computers whose usefulness had been limited because of lack of storage

<unk> <unk> said <unk> the acknowledged losses mean <unk> net asset backing is in the red to the tune of <unk> <unk> cents a share vs. positive asset backing of <unk> n a share a year ago
still the directors said having fully considered all aspects of the company state of affairs and future cash flows the directors confirm absolutely that the company is solvent
indeed in a note to the results directors said <unk> if the true worth of some of the group assets were taken into account instead of using book values the negative net asset backing a share would turn into a substantial positive one
the <unk> <unk> went out of business last may
the reason was not high interest rates or labor costs
nor was there a shortage of customers in the area the residential <unk> section of northern <unk>
the business closed when the owner was murdered by robbers
the owner was <unk> <unk> a n entrepreneur and father of two
in his first year of operating the store n he bought for <unk> <unk> <unk> was robbed at least twice at gunpoint
the first time he was shot in the hand as he chased the robbers outside
the second time he identified two robbers who were arrested and charged
two weeks later perhaps in retaliation <unk> <unk> was shot three times in the back during what police classified as a third robbery attempt
that was his reward for working until n p.m. seven days a week to cover his n a month rent
for providing what his customers described as very personal and helpful service
for creating a focus for neighborhood life
<unk> <unk> is only one of the thousands of entrepreneurs and their employees who will be injured or killed by crime this year
the <unk> <unk> of <unk> statistics reports that almost n of all retail - sales workers suffer injuries from crime each year almost twice the national average and about four times the rate for teachers truck drivers medical workers and door - to-door salespeople
only a few other occupations have higher reported rates of criminal injury such as police bartenders and taxi drivers
yet these figures show only the most visible part of the problem
recent data from <unk> <unk> <unk> provide more of the picture
while by no means the highest crime community in the country <unk> <unk> is a prime example of a city where crime strangles small - business development
a survey of small businesses there was conducted this spring by <unk> a policy research organization
it gave n businesses a questionnaire and analyzed <unk> responses
the survey found that over a three - year period n of the firms said n employees or owners had been robbed on their way to or from work or while on the job
seventeen percent reported their customers being robbed
crime was the reason that <unk> reported difficulty recruiting personnel and that <unk> said n they were considering moving
more than one - third of the responding businesses said n they suffer from drug dealing and loitering near their premises
in <unk> and the <unk> one out of four commercial firms is burglarized each year
industrial neighborhoods fare even worse with burglary rates twice the citywide average
crime is clearly more deadly to small - scale entrepreneurship than to big businesses
two decades ago the <unk> <unk> <unk> reported <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> landmark study of crime against <unk> small businesses drawn from national <unk> records
he found that monetary crime losses as a proportion of gross receipts were <unk> times higher for small businesses than for large ones
the <unk> <unk> study companies averaged <unk> employees their annual crime losses averaged about n with an additional n annual cost in security enough money to hire at least one more worker
the costs of crime may also be enough to destroy a struggling business
whatever the monetary crime losses they may not be nearly as important to entrepreneurs as the risk of personal injury
after repeated gun robberies some entrepreneurs may give up a business out of fear for their lives
one <unk> couple recently sold their liquor store after n years in business that included four robbery deaths and <unk> robberies or burglaries on the premises
these findings illustrate the vicious cycle that <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> calls crime causing poverty
underclass neighborhoods offer relatively few employment opportunities contributing to the poverty of local residents
small neighborhood businesses could provide more jobs if crime were not so harmful to creating and maintaining those businesses
this may help explain why small businesses create <unk> of all jobs nationally but only n of jobs in a crime - ridden city like <unk> <unk>
bigger business can often better afford to minimize the cost of crime
the <unk> <unk> study found that the cost of security measures in firms with fewer than five employees was almost n per worker compared with one - third that amount for firms with more than <unk> employees
the shift of retailing to large shopping centers has created even greater economies of scale for providing low - crime business environments
private security guards and moonlighting police can invoke the law of trespass to regulate access to these quasi - public places
since <unk> in fact revenues of the <unk> largest guard companies primarily serving such big businesses have increased by almost n
few small neighborhood businesses however can afford such protection even in collaboration with other local merchants
in the neighborhoods with the highest crime rates small business generally relies on the public police force for protection
this creates several problems
one is that there are not enough police to satisfy small businesses
the number one proposal for reducing crime in the <unk> <unk> survey was to put more police on foot or scooter patrol suggested by more than two - thirds of the respondents
only n supported private security patrols funded by the merchants themselves
a second problem is the persistent frustration of false alarms which can make urban police less than enthusiastic about responding to calls from small businesses
only half the <unk> <unk> small businesses surveyed for their part are satisfied with the police response n they receive
some cities including <unk> <unk> have experimented with special tax districts for commercial areas that provide additional patrols funded by local businesses
but this raises added cost barriers to urban entrepreneurship
another solution n cities might consider is giving special priority to police patrols of small - business areas
for cities losing business to suburban shopping centers it may be a wise business investment to help keep those jobs and sales taxes within city limits
increased patrolling of business zones makes sense because urban crime is heavily concentrated in such hot spots of pedestrian density
with <unk> <unk> of <unk> support the <unk> police and the <unk> <unk> <unk> are currently testing the effects of such a strategy comparing its deterrence value with traditional random patrols
small - business patrols would be an especially helpful gesture whenever a small - business person is scheduled to testify against a robbery suspect
while no guarantee an increased police presence might even deter further attacks
it might even have saved the life and business of <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a professor of criminology at the <unk> of <unk> and president of the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> said in <unk> that it hopes to raise n million canadian dollars <unk> n million through a rights offering to shareholders
under the offer shareholders can purchase one <unk> share at c$ n for each five shares held
in <unk> <unk> <unk> trading <unk> <unk> closed at c$ n down n cents
the holding company said n the rights offering should reduce its <unk> n million debt to more manageable levels before <unk> n and allow it to finance future investments with equity capital
at last report <unk> had about n million shares outstanding
former <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk> discussion <unk> <unk> of <unk> action on federal catastrophic - illness insurance

they will have to revisit this issue and they have to revisit it before long
diversification pays
that a fundamental lesson for investors but its truth was demonstrated once again in the performance of mutual funds during and after the stock market n plunge
stock funds like the market as a whole generally dropped more than <unk> in the week through last <unk> according to figures compiled by <unk> <unk> services <unk>
that reflects the huge drop a week ago <unk> last <unk> rebound and the dips and blips that followed
but several other types of funds shielded investors from the worst of the market slide
funds that invest internationally were the top - performing stock and fixed - income funds
more than ever people should realize <unk> they should have a diversified portfolio said <unk> <unk> a senior vice president of <unk> <unk>
that means stocks bonds money market instruments and real estate
one week performance should n't be the basis for any investment decision
but the latest mutual fund performance figures do show what can happen when the going gets rough
you want to know how a fund did when the market got hammered said <unk> <unk> an investment adviser with <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
it like kicking the tires of a car
what you want to know is when the road rough when there snow and ice how this car going to perform
general equity funds fell an average of <unk> in the week ended <unk> compared with a n slide for the <unk> <unk> <unk> index
but <unk> <unk> figures show that there were a number of ways <unk> investors could have cushioned themselves from the stock market gyrations
gold - oriented funds for instance which invest in companies that mine and process the precious metal posted an average decline of <unk>
flexible portfolio funds which allocate investments among stocks bonds and money - market instruments and other investments declined at about half the rate of stock funds an average drop of <unk> according to <unk>
global allocation funds take the asset - allocation concept one step further by investing at least <unk> of their portfolios outside the <unk>
this gives them the added benefits of international diversification including a foreign - exchange boost during periods like the past week when the dollar declines against other major currencies
with all that going for them global flexible portfolio funds declined only n in the week through last <unk>
but while the merits of diversification shine through when times are tough there also a price n to pay a diversified portfolio always underperforms an undiversified portfolio during those times when the investment in the undiversified portfolio is truly hot
and <unk> the n notwithstanding stocks have been this year hot investment
thus even including the latest week the average general stock fund has soared more than <unk> so far this year the <unk> <unk> figures show n
by comparison global asset allocation funds have turned in an average total return of about n while domestic flexible portfolios are up about <unk>
fixed - income funds have returned n while gold funds which tend to be volatile have risen just n on average
that the problem with trying to hedge too much said <unk> <unk>
you do n't make any real money
over the last n years for example <unk> <unk> says an investor putting n a year in the <unk> <unk> would have made nearly twice as much than if it were invested in <unk> bills
some equity funds did better than others in the week that began on <unk> the n
the n million <unk> <unk> for instance was the seventh top performing fund for the week with a n return
its return so far this year has been a credible n
the fund strategy is to sell when a stock appreciates <unk> over its cost
by the time n the market plummeted <unk> days ago <unk> was <unk> in cash said <unk> <unk> <unk> president and portfolio manager
last <unk> he started buying the high - quality growth companies that people were throwing away at discount prices
among <unk> <unk> picks <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
the fund cash position is now about <unk> which <unk> <unk> calls still bearish
among the big stock funds <unk> <unk> with more than n billion in assets had a decline of just n for the week and a return of <unk> for the year
<unk> <unk> chairman of <unk> <unk> said <unk> the fund was about half invested in government bonds on <unk> n and about <unk> in cash
in a downward market bonds act better he said
we still think n there a lot of unsettlement in this market
we believe <unk> interest rates will continue to trend lower and the economy will slow around the world
many of the funds that did best in the last week are heavily invested overseas giving them the benefit of foreign currency translations when the dollar is weak
from its high point on <unk> <unk> n to where it traded late in <unk> <unk> a week later the dollar fell n against the west german mark n against the british pound and n against the japanese yen
three <unk> <unk> portfolios funds which invest almost exclusively in bonds and money - market instruments overseas were among the four top - performing funds in the latest week
because the funds investments are denominated in foreign currencies their value expressed in dollars goes up when those currencies rise against the dollar
but when the dollar rises against major foreign currencies as it did for much of this year the dollar value of these funds declines
all three funds posted negative returns for the year to date
of the funds that fared the worst in the post - <unk> n week two are heavily invested in airlines stocks which led the market slide following problems with financing for the <unk> <unk> buy - out plan
reflecting airline takeover activity however both the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> fund posted better - than-average returns for the the year to date n for the <unk> <unk> <unk> fund and a whopping n for <unk> <unk> <unk>
the small drop in equity funds in general in the latest week may not necessarily be a good sign said <unk> a. <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk>
noting that equity funds are up nearly n from their post - crash low on <unk> n <unk> he said that what happened last week may not be enough of an adjustment
there either more <unk> to come or an extremely long period of dullness
but investors do n't seem to think so
several big mutual fund groups said last week that cash flows into stock funds were heavier than usual after heavy outflows on the n
<unk> <unk> said n it had a more than n million net inflow into its stock funds last week
there certainly has n't been a panic reaction said <unk> <unk> a vice president at <unk> <unk> <unk> associates
people showed some staying power and in fact interest in buying equities

after years of relative obscurity he is starting to attract notice for the ecological as well as the aesthetic quality of his architecture
<unk> <unk> believes that the well - being of the planet depends on such stratagems as opening windows to cut indoor air pollution tacking down carpets instead of using toxic glues and avoiding mahogany which comes from endangered rain forests
he has put some of his aesthetic ideas into practice with his design of the four - star <unk> <unk> restaurant architecturally impeccable <unk> <unk> magazine called it and his remodeling of <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> clothing store

but <unk> <unk> a celebrated prosecutor has had difficulty switching from his crime - busting finger - pointing mode to a political stance that suggests <unk> he might know something about running this big troubled city
and now at the crucial moment he running out of money
this is the nation biggest city and traditionally its mayor is the nation best - known urban politician
democrats hoped that <unk> <unk> could become a highly visible national leader
republicans figured that in <unk> <unk> the nation best - known prosecutor they had a chance for a huge upset in the heart of democratic territory and that they would pick up a new political star
but it has n't worked out that way

the alternative <unk> is ghastly
i guess n we reluctantly go ahead and do it vote for <unk> says <unk> <unk> a politically active professor who supported <unk> <unk> an also - ran in the democratic primary
there nothing on the other side

historically <unk> <unk> is almost always in trouble
but the trouble n it faces now under democratic rule seems bigger and more daunting than anything <unk> it has faced in the past

why even n of the republican vote is going to <unk>

paper work on how it was spent is incomplete
<unk> <unk> has been charged with being anti - <unk>
asked about that the other day he replied <unk> - <unk>
i anti - white
more troubling for <unk> <unk> is his record in personal accounting
it began in n when he was being considered for deputy mayor and a routine check unearthed the extraordinary fact that he had n't paid his income tax for the previous four years
i was always going to do it tomorrow he explained n at the time
and now he busily trying to explain an arrangement in which he sold stock in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> headed by his old friend and patron <unk> <unk> to his son <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk>
he had valued the shares at more than n million two years earlier
he says <unk> he sold the stock to avoid conflict - of-interest problems in his role as a voting member of the city <unk> of <unk>
he says <unk> his son has n't paid for the shares
it looks like serious tax evasion says <unk> <unk> the <unk> media consultant
it follows the same pattern as his tax returns
he waits to talk about it until after he gets caught
he simply has n't explained why something worth a million dollars ended up worth n two years later says <unk> <unk> the <unk> campaign manager
it ludicrous for him to suggest n it the difference between the'breakup value of the shares and their market value
so far though no one not even former <unk> attorney <unk> has been able to pinpoint just what law <unk> <unk> has broken or just what tax he has evaded
the crime goes to character says <unk> <unk> a consultant to the <unk> campaign
it serious stuff

the company attributed the decline to consumers concern over interest rates and gas prices two key expenses for rv buyers
it a large - ticket discretionary purchase said <unk> <unk> who follows the industry for <unk> <unk> <unk>
so when there talk and concern about the economy it not unreasonable for a portion of the buying public to defer purchases
<unk> <unk> expects industry <unk> sales for all of n to fall about <unk> from <unk> when sales of <unk> units were the highest since n
and he said n the weakness could continue in the first half of next year
but he said n the industry has a good decade ahead particularly if aging baby boomers fulfill the industry dreams by buying rvs

bullish bond market sentiment is on the rise again
as the government prepares to release the next batch of economic reports the consensus among economists and money managers is that the news will be negative
and that they say will be good for bonds
recent data have indicated somewhat weaker economic activity said <unk> <unk> director of economic research at <unk> <unk> <unk> securities
<unk> <unk> is advising clients that the near - term direction of bond prices is likely to remain upward
analysts insist that even without help from a shaky stock market which provided a temporary boost for bonds during the <unk> n stock market plunge bond prices will start to climb on the prospects that the <unk> <unk> will allow interest rates to move lower in the coming weeks
that would be comforting to fixed - income investors many of whom were badly burned in the third quarter by incorrectly assuming that the <unk> would ease
investors rushed to buy bonds during the summer as prices soared on speculation that interest rates would continue to fall
but when it became clear that rates had stabilized and that the <unk> credit - easing policy was on hold bond yields jumped and prices tumbled
long - term bonds have performed erratically this year
for example a group of long - term <unk> bonds tracked by <unk> <unk> <unk> produced a total return of <unk> in the first quarter <unk> in the second quarter and n in the third quarter
total return is price changes plus interest income
now some investment analysts insist that the economic climate has turned cold and gloomy and they are urging clients to buy bonds before the rally begins
among other things economists note that consumer spending is slowing corporate profit margins are being squeezed business confidence is slipping and construction and manufacturing industries are depressed
at the same time last week consumer price index showed that inflation is moderating
add it all up and it means that the <unk> has a little leeway n to ease its credit policy stance without the risk of rekindling inflation said <unk> <unk> <unk> chief economist at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
i think n we will see a federal funds rate of close to <unk> <unk> in the next two weeks and n by year end
the federal funds rate which banks charge each other on overnight loans is considered an early signal of changes in the <unk> credit policy
economists generally agree that the rate was lowered by the <unk> from around <unk> where it had been since <unk> to about <unk> <unk> in early <unk> on the heels of a weak employment report
although the rate briefly drifted even lower following the stock market sell - off that occurred <unk> n it ended <unk> at about <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> chief fixed - income strategist at <unk> <unk> is touting shorter - term securities which he says n should benefit more quickly than longer - term bonds as interest rates fall
given our forecast for lower rates purchases made now should prove quite rewarding before year end he said
<unk> <unk> also likes long - term investment - grade corporate bonds and long - term treasurys
he says n these bonds should appreciate in value as some investors reacting to the recent turmoil in the stock and high - yield junk bond markets seek safer securities
if the <unk> <unk> <unk> sale is any guide there appears to be good demand for top - quality long - term paper from both domestic and overseas accounts he said
<unk> in its first public debt offering in <unk> years sold n billion of long - term and intermediate - term securities last week
strong investor demand prompted the utility to boost the size of the issue from <unk> billion
<unk> which operates one of the nation largest electric power systems is a corporation owned by the federal government
but persuading investors to buy bonds may be especially tough this week when the <unk> government will auction more than <unk> billion of new securities
today the <unk> <unk> will sell n billion of three - month and six - month bills at the regular weekly auction
tomorrow the <unk> will sell n billion of two - year notes
<unk> <unk> <unk> known as <unk> a division of a new government agency created to bail out the nation troubled savings and loan associations will hold its first bond auction <unk> when it will sell n billion of <unk> bonds
all of this comes ahead of the government big quarterly refunding of the federal debt which takes place sometime in <unk>
so far investors have n't shown much appetite for <unk> initial bond offering
<unk> early a portfolio manager at <unk> investors <unk> said that yields on the so - called bailout bonds are n't high enough to attract his attention
why should i bother with something that an unknown for a very small pickup in yield he said
i not going to jump on them the first day n they come out
he seems to be typical of many professional money managers
when the size of the <unk> offering was announced last week and when - issued trading activity began the bailout bonds were yielding about <unk> percentage point more than the <unk> benchmark <unk> bond
on <unk> the yield was quoted at about n percentage point higher than the benchmark bond an indication of weak demand
some economists believe that yields on all <unk> securities may rise this week as the market struggles to absorb the new supply
but once the new securities are digested they expect investors to focus on the weak economic data
the supply is not a constraint to the market said <unk> <unk> chief financial economist at <unk> <unk> <unk> securities <unk>
if one thinks that rates are going down you do n't care how much supply is coming
<unk> <unk>
most bond prices fell on concerns about this week new supply and disappointment that stock prices did n't stage a sharp decline
junk bond prices moved higher however
in early trading <unk> bonds were higher on expectations that a surge in buying among japanese investors would continue
also providing support to treasurys was hope that the stock market might see declines because of the expiration of some stock - index futures and options on indexes and individual stocks
those hopes were dashed when the stock market put in a relatively quiet performance
<unk> bonds ended with losses of as much as <unk> point or about n for each <unk> face amount
the benchmark <unk> bond which traded as high as <unk> <unk> during the day ended at <unk> <unk>
the yield on the benchmark bond rose slightly to <unk> from <unk>
in the corporate bond market traders said <unk> the new - issue market for junk bonds is likely to pick up following <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> n million junk bond offering <unk>
today for example underwriters at <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> they expect to price a n million n senior subordinated debenture offering by <unk> <unk> <unk>
traders expect the issue to be priced to yield n
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said that a n million senior subordinated discount debenture issue by <unk> <unk> drugs is expected by the end of the month
however despite the big new - issue calendar many junk bond investors and analysts are skeptical n the deals will get done
there are about a dozen more deals coming said <unk> <unk> director of fixed - income research at <unk> <unk> services <unk>
if they had this much trouble with <unk> <unk> <unk> they are going to have an awful time with the rest
last week underwriters were forced to postpone three junk bond deals because of recent weakness in the market
and pressure by big investors forced <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to sweeten <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> million junk bond offering
after hours of negotiating that stretched late into <unk> night underwriters priced the <unk> issue of resettable senior subordinated debentures at par to yield n higher than the <unk> that had been expected
the coupon on the issue will be reset in one year at a rate that will give the issue a market value of n
however the maximum coupon rate on the issue when it is reset is <unk>
debenture holders also will receive the equivalent of <unk> of the common stock in <unk> <unk> western parent company
the coupon was raised to induce some of the big players on the fence to come in said a spokesman for <unk>
we put a price on the deal that the market required to get it done
the spokesman said n the issue was sold out and met with strong interest abroad particularly from japanese investors
in the secondary or resale market junk bonds closed n point higher while investment - grade corporate bonds fell n to n point

without admitting any guilt the bureau agreed to several conditions if it again contracts with an outside firm to publish its directories
the conditions include not misrepresenting how many directories will be distributed and agreeing to make refunds to directory advertisers if any misrepresentations are involved in the sale

<unk> <unk> president and chief executive officer attributed the expected decline partly to the effects of a two - week strike last month at the company <unk> <unk> bakeware facility
softer - than-expected orders in early <unk> also played a role he said n in an interview
but <unk> <unk> said <unk> he is reasonably confident that earnings for the full year will exceed the n million or n cents a share in <unk>
that would require fourth - quarter net of more than about <unk> cents to n cents a share assuming that <unk> <unk> third - quarter estimate proves accurate
in the year - earlier fourth quarter the company had profit of n million or n cents a share

he indicated that <unk> may be interested in acquiring another company with revenue in the range of n million to n million partly because mass merchandisers increasingly want to rely on larger and fewer suppliers
after several years of booming business with <unk> foreign traders are bracing for the biggest slump in a decade
the imposition of austerity measures starting last <unk> already had begun to pinch when the massacre in <unk> <unk> on <unk> n and subsequent events tugged the belt far tighter
foreign lending has been virtually suspended since then choking liquidity and hobbling many projects
and <unk> has pulled back on domestic loans and subsidies leaving many domestic buyers and export - oriented plants strapped for cash
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a swiss concern that sells chemicals to shampoo and soap factories in <unk> typifies the problems
last year retrenchment dried up the working capital of chinese factories
the company sales flattened during <unk> first half
the <unk> killings magnified the problems
in <unk> <unk> representative office received no orders in <unk>
at first it attributed the slump to temporary business disruptions but when no orders were logged in <unk> and <unk> manager <unk> <unk> became convinced that business would be bad for many months
things have grown worse since <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> says
he predicts that sales will drop between <unk> and <unk> from last year n million
the consumer - products and light - industrial sectors are bearing the brunt of <unk> austerity measures and foreign companies such as <unk> that deal with those industries are being hit the hardest
but in general all foreign - trading companies are feeling the pinch
the import pie will shrink says <unk> <unk> first vice president of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> in <unk> <unk> and a <unk> trade specialist
on the down side sales could fall as much as <unk> for some companies on the upper side sales will be flat
<unk> foreign trade has gone in cycles during the past decade
the last time that traders experienced a trough was during <unk> when <unk> imposed tough measures n to curb imports and conserve foreign exchange
the current trough is expected to be much deeper because <unk> has cut off domestic funds from factories for the first time to slow inflation
in addition the suspension of loans and export credits from foreign governments and institutions following the <unk> killings have been a big setback
the freeze on new lending is dealing the single biggest blow to trading says <unk> <unk> <unk> manager for <unk> <unk> a west german machinery - trading company
import growth from the year - earlier months slowed to n in <unk> and <unk> in <unk> compared with an average growth rate of n in the first half
in the first eight months of n imports grew <unk> to n billion down slightly from a growth rate of <unk> a year earlier
the picture for <unk> exports is just as bleak mainly because of the domestic credit squeeze
exports in the first eight months grew only <unk> to n billion compared with a growth rate of <unk> a year earlier according to chinese customs figures
the threat to <unk> balance of payments is further aggravated by the plunge in its foreign - exchange reserves excluding gold holdings
the reserves dropped for the first time in recent years to n billion in <unk> from <unk> billion in <unk>
the trend has prompted <unk> to intensify efforts to curb imports
in recent weeks <unk> leaders have recentralized trading in wool and scores of chemical products and commodities
the <unk> of <unk> <unk> relations and <unk> set up a special bureau last month to monitor the issue of import and export licenses
<unk> periodic clampdowns on imports have taught many trading companies that the best way n to get through the drought is by helping <unk> export
for example <unk> <unk> <unk> one of the biggest japanese trading houses now buys almost twice as many goods from <unk> as it sells to that country
three years ago the ratio was reversed
but the strategy is n't helping much this time
both sectors of imports and exports look just as bad says <unk> <unk> general manager of <unk> <unk> <unk> office
he expects the company trading business to drop as much as <unk> this year
for a short time after <unk> n it appeared that the trade picture would remain fairly bright
many foreign trading offices in <unk> <unk> were swamped with telexes and telephone calls from chinese trade officials urging them not to sever ties
even the <unk> of <unk> which normally took weeks to process letters of credit was settling the letters at record speed to dispel rumors about the bank financial health
but when foreign traders tried to do business they discovered that the eagerness of chinese trade officials was just a smokescreen
the suspension of foreign loans has weakened the buying power of <unk> national trading companies which are among the country biggest importers
business is n't any better on the provincial or municipal level foreign traders say n
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> known as <unk> is the city main financier for trading business

foreign traders say n the company is strapped for cash
it has difficulties paying its foreign debts says a <unk> <unk> executive who is familiar with <unk> business
how can it make available funds for purchases
foreign traders also say n many of <unk> big infrastructural projects have been canceled or postponed because of the squeeze on domestic and foreign credit
<unk> <unk> a veteran trader who specializes in machinery sales estimates that as many as n of projects that had obtained approval to proceed have been canceled in recent months
there are virtually no new projects and that means no new business for us he says n
even when new lending resumes foreign exchange would still be tight because <unk> will likely try to rein in foreign borrowing which has grown between <unk> and <unk> in the past few years
and foreign creditors are likely to be more cautious about extending new loans because <unk> is nearing a peak repayment period as many loans start falling due in the next two to five years
another reason for the intensity of the trade problems is that <unk> has extended the current clampdown on imports beyond the usual target of consumer products to include steel chemical fertilizers and plastics
these have been among the country leading imports particularly last year when there were shortages that led many traders to buy heavily and pay dearly
but the shortages also spawned rampant speculation and spiraling prices
to stem speculation <unk> imposed ceiling prices that went into effect earlier this year
traders who had bought the goods at prices above the ceiling do n't want to take a loss on resales and are holding onto their stock
the resulting stockpiling has depressed the market
but <unk> ca n't cut back on such essential imports as raw materials for too long without hampering the country export business
<unk> <unk> the <unk> trade expert estimates that as much as <unk> of <unk> exports is made up of processed imported raw materials

the irony in this novel is that neither man represents a safe middle - class haven <unk> decision is between emotional excitement and emotional security with no firm economic base anywhere
the characters confront a world in which it seems increasingly difficult to find a middle way between the extremes of success and failure wealth and poverty
in making <unk> and <unk> such wonderfully representative specimens of their class and generation <unk> <unk> has somewhat neglected the task of making them distinctively individual characters
the humor of the story owes much to the fact that no hearts even the characters own are likely to bleed for the plight of health - food eaters
but readers may well feel the pangs of recognition
in any case the foundering middle classes are n't the only ones in trouble or whose troubles provide material for fiction
rascal <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> pages n a novel by consultant and business analyst <unk> <unk> <unk> tells the story of an innovative well - run widely respected computer manufacturing company called <unk> as it faces a hostile takeover attempt by <unk> a much smaller corporation that is so incompetently managed as to constitute a standing joke in the business world
patrician dynamic <unk> <unk> founder and head of <unk> initially finds the takeover threat risible
but as he and his skilled team soon discover they up against two factors n they had n't counted on first a business climate in which a failing company with few assets and many debts can borrow against the assets of the successful company n it hopes to acquire in order to finance the takeover second that standing behind <unk> is a sinister consortium of much bigger shadier and shrewder foreign interests secretly providing the money and muscle for the deal
<unk> <unk> manages to invest this tale of financial wars with the colorful characters and fast - paced action of a suspense novel
and like a spy or mystery story this novel has strong elements of allegory as the good and evil forces battle it out
<unk> <unk> depicts these moral qualities with the broad brush strokes of a satire that occasionally descends to the realm of cliched caricatures
standard - issue portraits of flaky californians snobbish homosexuals and neanderthal union leaders undermine the force of the author perceptions
yet the heavy - handedness of the satire also can be effective in a book like this if the head of <unk> were not portrayed as an utterly contemptible malicious dolt we would not much care whether his schemes were defeated and would not be so diverted in the process
<unk> <unk> is a free - lance writer based in <unk> <unk>
high - definition television promises to be the tv of tomorrow so it is a natural multibillion - dollar market
although major <unk> manufacturers have all but ceded the main segment of that future business to <unk> not everyone here is ready to give up
a handful of small <unk> companies are struggling to develop the technology n to build the screens for the thin high - quality televisions that are expected to hang on living room walls by the end of the <unk>
with only small help from the government these start - up concerns are trying to compete with the goliaths of the japanese consumer electronics industry which enjoy considerable backing from the japanese government
<unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> aims to use a new form of plasma technology to put movie - quality images on a tv display that is n inches in diameter but only a few inches thick
<unk> systems <unk> of <unk> <unk> the largest of these firms with n million in annual revenue has similar plans
it already has had success in electroluminescence another promising technology adaptable for high - definition television
two other firms <unk> <unk> systems <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> are developing a variation of the flat - panel screens called active - matrix liquid crystal displays
the new technologies are intended to retire the cathode - ray tube which accounts for most of the bulk of the conventional tv set
replacing the cathode - ray tube with a large thin screen is the key to the creation of a high - definition television or hdtv which is expected to become a n billion business world - wide within a decade
large <unk> companies are interested in other segments of the hdtv business such as signal - processing and broadcast equipment
but except for <unk> electronics <unk> and <unk> <unk> machines <unk> which is collaborating with <unk> on computer displays they are poorly positioned to exploit advances in large panels
<unk> <unk> <unk> recently sold off its interests in liquid - crystal displays to <unk> - <unk> of <unk>
we found the market not developing as we thought <unk> it would a <unk> spokesman says
the small <unk> firms are persisting because of their strong positions in patents and because the prize is still there to be seized
no one yet has shown the ability to manufacture these panels at commercial costs says <unk> <unk> <unk> the president of <unk> <unk>
he says <unk> he thinks <unk> his company is just a few years from doing that
the <unk> administration hearing conflicting advice about what its role in hdtv should be is n't doing much for now
the only material support n it is extending to the struggling <unk> industry is n million in awards from the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the <unk> funds are a pittance compared with what <unk> and other prospective competitors are spending
the <unk> <unk> estimates that japanese government and industry spending on hdtv research is already over <unk> billion
unless it gets more help the <unk> industry wo n't have a chance says <unk> <unk> <unk> executive vice president
thus far almost all of the basic technology relating to high - definition television has come from <unk> laboratories
but <unk> <unk> <unk> president says n japanese companies are poised to snatch the technology and put it to commercial use just as they did with earlier <unk> innovations in color television and video recording
in the <unk> <unk> <unk> helped develop the first display panels based on active - matrix liquid crystals at <unk> <unk> <unk> research labs in <unk>
the panels are like oversized semiconductors surfaced with a million or more picture elements each contributing to the color and tone of a tv image
in <unk> however <unk> abandoned the project along with its stake in advanced television
<unk> <unk> left the company to find other backers
he has a claim to the right to commercialize the <unk> patents but he contends that those patents are being infringed by a number of japanese producers
most american investors have just given up <unk> <unk> says
they are n't prepared to compete in an area where the japanese want to enter
many critics question the industry need for federal support the <unk> justifies its help on national - security grounds
we do n't see a domestic source for some of our hdtv requirements and that a source of concern says <unk> <unk> director of <unk> defense manufacturing office
so <unk> is trying to keep the industry interested in developing large display panels by doling out research funds
hdtv already has some military applications such as creating realistic flight simulations and transmitting information to combat commanders
the <unk> is ordering displays for its <unk> cruisers and the <unk> wants smaller versions for its <unk> battle tanks
the <unk> <unk> also is trying to encourage hdtv because of the benefits that could spin off to the semiconductor and computer industries
it is n't just yuppie television argues <unk> <unk> director of the department office of microelectronics and instrumentation
the industry will create industrial products such as displays for work stations and medical diagnostic equipment before it acquires a mass consumer market
although some hdtv advocates are calling for other forms of aid such as antitrust relief for research consortia the small firms simply would prefer more <unk> funds
each claims to possess the right technology and wants just a bit more money to make it commercial
they also want <unk> trade policy to reflect the <unk> and <unk> department concern over their future
they all are strongly opposed to a petition from several japanese tv manufacturers including <unk> <unk> and <unk> to exempt portable color tvs with liquid - crystal displays from anti - dumping duties that the <unk> imposes on the larger japanese color tvs
and they want the <unk> to help them sell overseas
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> says <unk> he has to pay tariffs as high as n to sell his display panels in <unk> and <unk> <unk> while panels from those countries enter the <unk> duty - free
this is n't a technology issue but an attitude issue he says
we just have n't learned what it takes to compete

growth is good
at least that a theme emerging among many money managers who are anxious both to preserve the handsome stock - market gains n they have already achieved this year and to catch the next wave of above - average performers
they are starting to buy growth stocks
remember them
the upper echelon of this group were shares of the nifty n companies whose profits of the <unk> and early n grew steadily if not spectacularly through thick and thin

the question for investors is how to protect these returns and yet reach a little for additional gains
that the path of reasoning leading to growth stocks
i think n it is a good theme for what looks to be an uncertain market says <unk> <unk> partner at <unk> <unk>
growth stocks may be as big as <unk> <unk> or medium - sized such as <unk> <unk> stores but their common characteristic is a history of increasing profits on the order of at least <unk> to <unk> a year money managers say n
the period when growth stocks should be performing well is when their earnings are growing at a superior rate to the general level of corporate profits says <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
growth stocks also are attractive in periods of market volatility which many investors and analysts expect in the weeks ahead as everybody tries to discern where the economy is heading
this kind of jumpy uncertainty reminds <unk> <unk> senior economist for <unk> <unk> <unk> of the n period when the industrial average rolled through huge ranges and investors flocked to the shares of companies with proven earnings records which became known as the nifty n
and they will again say <unk> money - manager proponents of the growth - stock theme
<unk> <unk> president of a money management company bearing his name predicts that investment companies using computers to identify companies with earnings momentum will climb on the growth - stock bandwagon as the overall corporate earnings outlook deteriorates further

but not all strategists or money managers are ready to throw in the towel completely on cyclicals
growth stocks may underperform cyclical stocks next year if the <unk> <unk> begins to let interest rates drift sufficiently lower to boost the economy

the collapse of a n billion buy - out of <unk> <unk> parent <unk> <unk> has handed <unk> <unk> takeover stock speculators their worst loss ever on a single deal
their n million - plus in estimated paper losses easily tops the n million in paper losses n the takeover traders known as arbitragers suffered in <unk> when <unk> <unk> <unk> dropped a n billion offer for <unk> <unk> <unk>
in the six trading days since the <unk> labor - management buy - out group failed to get bank financing culminating <unk> with the withdrawal of its partner <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> stock has plummeted by <unk> to <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk>
the arbs may recoup some of their paper losses if the <unk> deal gets patched up again as they did in <unk> when <unk> <unk> <unk> rescued them with a n billion takeover of cities <unk>
in the meantime the question faced by investors is what is <unk> stock worth
the short answer on a fundamental basis is that airline analysts say n the stock is worth somewhere between <unk> and <unk> a share
that based on a multiple of anywhere between <unk> to <unk> times <unk> earnings which are estimated to come in somewhere around <unk> a share this year
airline stocks typically sell at a discount of about one - third to the stock market price - earnings ratio which is currently about n times earnings
that because airline earnings like those of auto makers have been subject to the cyclical ups - and-downs of the economy
that analysis matches up with stock traders reports that despite the huge drop in the stock <unk> has n't returned to the level at which it could attract buying by institutions solely on the basis of earnings
so anyone buying the stock now is betting on some special transaction such as a recapitalization or takeover and must do so using some guesswork about the likelihood of such an event
one analyst who asked not to be identified said <unk> he believes that the <unk> pilots and management can put together a bid in the n area but that it could take three to four months to close
at that level and given the uncertainty he believes n <unk> stock should trade closer
other observers note that <unk> board having accepted a bid of <unk> a share might hold out for a new bid much closer to the original level even if it means that the management goes back to running the company for a while and lets things return to normal
by that logic the closing of a deal could be much further away than three to four months even though the eventual price might be higher
investment bankers following <unk> agree that the strongest impetus for an eventual deal is that the pilots have been attempting a buy - out for more than two years and are n't likely to stop having come so close to success
the pilots have a strong financing tool in their willingness to cut their annual compensation by n million and to commit n million from their retirement funds
on <unk> they also persuaded the <unk> flight attendants to join them
however investment bankers say that banks are n't likely to lend the almost n billion that would be necessary for a takeover even at a lower price without someone putting up a hefty wad of cash probably even greater than the <unk> in cash put up by investors in the leveraged takeover of <unk> airlines parent <unk> <unk> in <unk>
banks want to see someone putting up real cash at risk that is subordinate to the bank debt in any deal
that way they figure n someone else has an even stronger motivation n to make sure n the deal is going to work because they would be losing their money before the banks lost theirs
banks also want to be able to call someone n on the telephone to fix a problem with a deal that goes bad preferably someone other than a union leader
that leaves the pilots still in need of cash totaling around <unk> billion far more than either they or the flight attendants can lay their hands on from retirement funds alone
one obstacle to the pilots finding such a huge amount of cash is their insistence on majority ownership
investors such as <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> who have sought airline ownership this year have insisted n they not the pilots must have control
one way out of that dilemma could be a partial recapitalization in which the pilots would wind up sharing the value of their concessions with public shareholders
the pilots could borrow against the value of their concessions using the proceeds to buy back stock from the public and give themselves the majority control n they have been seeking
but it is n't clear that banks would lend sufficient money to deliver a big enough price to shareholders
the lack of any new cash probably would still leave the banks dissatisfied
in advising the <unk> board on the various bids for the airline starting with one for n a share from <unk> <unk> the investment bank of <unk> <unk> came up with a wide range of potential values for the company depending on appraisal methods and assumptions
using the the <unk> takeover as a benchmark <unk> <unk> on <unk> n estimated that <unk> was worth <unk> to n a share based on <unk> results for the <unk> months ending last <unk> n but only <unk> to <unk> based on a management estimate of results for n
<unk> <unk> estimates had been higher before management supplied a n projection
using estimates of the company future earnings under a variety of scenarios <unk> <unk> estimated <unk> value at <unk> to n a share if its future labor costs conform to <unk> <unk> projections <unk> to n if the company reaches a settlement with pilots similar to one at <unk> <unk> to <unk> under an adverse labor settlement and <unk> to n under a pilot contract imposed by the company following a strike
and using liquidation value assuming the sale of all <unk> assets <unk> <unk> estimated n the airline is worth <unk> to n a share
unfortunately all those estimates came before airline industry fundamentals deteriorated during the past month
<unk> <unk> parent <unk> and <unk> <unk> both subject to takeover efforts themselves have each warned of declining results
some analysts do n't expect a quick revival of any takeover by the pilots
the deal has as one takeover expert puts it so many moving parts
i do n't see anybody who sophisticated getting his name associated with this mess until the moving parts stop moving
in addition to the need for another cash equity investor the other moving parts include the pilots themselves who can scuttle rival deals by threatening to strike the machinists union the pilots longtime rivals who helped scuttle the pilots deal and regulators in <unk> whose opposition to foreign airline investment helped throw the deal into doubt
in the meantime the arbs are bleeding
<unk> <unk> traders and analysts estimate that takeover stock traders own <unk> stock and options equal to as many as n million shares or about <unk> of the total outstanding
<unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> estimates that the arbs paid an average of about <unk> a share for their <unk> positions

revenue was n million up from n million
for the nine months net was n million or n cents a share up n from n million or n cents a share a year earlier

<unk> makes supercomputers that sell for up to n million and has an installed base of more than <unk> systems and n customers world - wide
during the third quarter it said n it won several significant contracts including a five - year contract with the <unk> institutes of <unk> valued at an estimated n million
earlier this month <unk> made a bid to outflank other supercomputer competitors like <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> machines <unk> by adopting an open set of standards and introducing new hardware and software n to link different systems
the new products allow customers to add <unk> machines to established systems made by other manufacturers which opens up a phenomenal market for us said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman president and chief executive
<unk> also recently agreed to use <unk> a standard for the computer language called <unk>
<unk> is one of three or four versions of <unk> but it is increasingly required by the federal government as it tries to standardize its computer systems
most other supercomputer manufacturers have yet to adopt the <unk> standard <unk> <unk> said <unk> adding that they prefer to maintain proprietary systems that lock in customers
they want a lobster trap once you get in you ca n't get out he said
but the customer does n't want that
<unk> closed in over - the-counter trading on <unk> at <unk> a share down n cents
troubled <unk> <unk> <unk> has attracted offers for some of its advertising units with potential suitors including <unk> <unk> but has rejected them people familiar with the company said n
industry executives said <unk> <unk> approached <unk> in <unk> about buying its <unk> - <unk> unit but was turned down by <unk> <unk> <unk>
more recently <unk> inquired about one of <unk> smaller communications companies identified as the <unk> public relations firm by several industry executives but again was rebuffed they said n
<unk> chairman and chief executive officer <unk> <unk> <unk> made the pitches in visits to <unk> <unk> in <unk> the executives said n
a <unk> spokesman declined to comment about <unk>
but the spokesman confirmed that <unk> has received several inquiries from companies interested in acquiring its <unk> - <unk> and <unk> units
he added we have no intention of selling either business
<unk> declined comment
the offers come as <unk> is struggling through the most troubled period in its n history
takeover speculation has been rife its consulting business is on the block and its largest shareholder <unk> <unk> <unk> has said n it been approached by third parties regarding a possible restructuring
analysts have continually lowered their earnings estimates for the company and their outlook at least for the short term is bleak
in the midst of the current turmoil <unk> is attempting to shore up its ad businesses
it named a new chief executive officer former <unk> <unk> head <unk> <unk> - <unk>
it rebuffed an offer by <unk> <unk> head of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> unit to lead a management buy - out of all or part of <unk>
and last week people close to <unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> and his brother <unk> would lead a buy - out if a hostile bid emerged
but <unk> troubles have only whipped up interest among outsiders interested in picking off pieces of its ad businesses
while <unk> major agency networks <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> would be difficult for any ad firm to buy because of potential client conflicts its smaller businesses are quite attractive
<unk> - <unk> for example has had big problems at its <unk> <unk> office but offers strong offices in other areas of the country including <unk> and <unk>
that would would make it appealing to a network such as <unk> that already has a healthy <unk> <unk> presence
while there would be some client conflicts they would n't be nearly as onerous as with <unk> other agencies
<unk> - <unk> also would be a sizable addition to an agency network it has billings of about n million and blue - chip clients including <unk> mills <unk> and <unk> brands
<unk> meanwhile has expanded aggressively and now ranks as the fifth - largest <unk> public relations firm according to <unk> 's <unk> of <unk> relations firms
it would be attractive to an agency such as <unk> one of the few big agency groups without an affiliated public relations firm of its own
other <unk> units include ad agency <unk> <unk> which has the <unk> account and which has been attempting to buy itself back and <unk> <unk> a sports and event marketing firm
despite <unk> firm stand against selling its ad units <unk> analysts believe n the company may ultimately sell some of the smaller units
<unk> <unk> - <unk> in a recent interview said <unk> he might sell a marginal agency or office
analysts believe n he may ultimately dispose of some of the non - advertising businesses

<unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> said <unk> it selected four agencies to pitch its n million to n million account
in addition to <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> unit that has handled the account since <unk> the other agencies include <unk> <unk> a unit of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> agency
all agencies are <unk> <unk> - based
a spokesman for the insurance and financial services firm based in <unk> <unk> said <unk> it hopes to make a decision within three to four months
<unk> fires
the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the wake of <unk> <unk> indictment on charges that it bribed jamaican officials to win the account in <unk> released a scathing memo blaming the agency for the embarrassing incident
the memo attempts to remove the tourist board as far as possible from the agency which pleaded innocent to the charges
among other things the memo contends that <unk> <unk> gave false assurances that the investigation would n't uncover any information that would embarrass the government of <unk> or the <unk> <unk> <unk>
it also contends that <unk> <unk> never told the tourist board about its relationship with <unk> ventures a jamaican firm hired by the agency
the <unk> indictment charges n <unk> ventures was a front used to funnel kickbacks to the then - minister of tourism
the memo also chastises the agency for the timing of its announcement <unk> that it would no longer handle the n million to n million account
the agency declined comment but said n it will continue work until a new agency is chosen

<unk> talks
<unk> <unk> <unk> president and chief executive officer <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> the agency is holding conversations about acquiring <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a midsized <unk> agency but a deal is n't yet close to being completed
who <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> former president and chief executive of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> office was named management director and director of account services at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> agency in <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> was named president and chief operating officer of <unk> <unk> <unk> the direct mail division of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> agency
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> food and beverage group that owns <unk> <unk> of the <unk> announced a reshuffling of board - level executive duties intended to fit the company recent expansion
<unk> <unk> formerly group finance director at <unk> <unk> <unk> will become <unk> <unk> first group finance director in <unk>
in a statement <unk> <unk> said <unk> its recent growth and wider geographic spread made it necessary to create the new position
the company also reassigned several executive responsibilities
<unk> <unk> formerly in charge of gambling operations was appointed chief executive for retailing and property
<unk> <unk> group strategy development director and <unk> <unk> group personnel director will become part of the board management committee
<unk> <unk> who has just been named president of <unk> <unk> already knows what it like to go through life with <unk> laureate appended to one name
he is currently experiencing what it like to have the phrase under investigation for scientific fraud also attached to his name
the <unk> committee made the first addition <unk> <unk> congressional committee created the second
both of <unk> <unk> public faces have been on view the past few weeks while he was under consideration to succeed <unk> <unk> as head of the prestigious <unk> research institution
it came to light that a substantial number of <unk> faculty were upset over or even opposed to <unk> <unk> impending appointment
they were disturbed at what they regarded as <unk> <unk> confrontational attitude toward the <unk> committee which held hearings on a dispute over the lab notebooks of a researcher who had co - authored a scientific paper with <unk> <unk>
readers of these columns the science <unk> <unk> <unk> will recall that <unk> <unk> was merely the most well - known part of the <unk> committee larger investigation which touched <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> institutes of <unk> and elsewhere
<unk> <unk> even managed to enlist the services of the <unk> <unk> in his investigation of the <unk> paper
insofar as <unk> <unk> has a special interest in <unk> and the institutions that receive its funding the <unk> scientists were no doubt discomfited by <unk> <unk> unflattering public opinion of this congressional patron whose behavior reminded <unk> <unk> of the <unk> era
this well may be the first time that the venerable <unk> <unk> has brushed up publicly against the intimidations now common in american science
<unk> <unk> demagogues a <unk> <unk> animal - rights activists do n million of damage to labs at the <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> decries the horrors of chemistry on talk shows <unk> <unk> files lawsuits in federal court to thwart biotech experiments and dutch - elm-disease researcher <unk> <unk> own colleagues at <unk> <unk> denounce him for violating <unk> rules
scientists are mistaken who still think that the anti - science movement in this country is n't their concern or that a <unk> <unk> could have somehow placated a <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> by the way has decreed another <unk> investigation of the <unk> paper adding to several previous investigations
something other than what most scientists would recognize as the truth is being sought here
fortunately there are signs that increasing numbers of scientists understand the necessity of speaking out
<unk> <unk> a <unk> laureate at <unk> has taken the lead in defending research with animals as has <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> defended itself vigorously and successfully against a <unk> suit n to block the <unk> launch
scientists need to understand that while they tend to believe n their work is primarly about establishing new knowledge or doing good today it is also about power
in a media - linked world scientists may earn wide praise and even nobels for their work but they also attract the attention of people who wish to gain control over the content funding and goals of that work
when a <unk> <unk> or the next target decides n it is better to stand up to these forces his fellow scientists would do well to recognize what is fundamentally at stake and offer their public support
<unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> it definitively agreed to acquire closely held <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> for stock currently valued at about n million
the <unk> toy retailer said n the agreement calls for <unk> <unk> <unk> holders to receive for their holdings a total of <unk> newly issued <unk> <unk> shares
<unk> <unk> currently has about n million shares outstanding
a company official said <unk> <unk> <unk> until <unk> chief operating officer of <unk> <unk> <unk> will buy a <unk> stake in the new <unk> <unk> subsidiary and will act as head of <unk> a <unk>

despite a history of heated local debate on the topic my passport clearly reads british citizen
whether <unk> <unk> oversight is merely a sign of a mainlander benign neglect is a question n my fellow <unk> islanders and friends on the <unk> of <unk> will continue to ponder

<unk> <unk> <unk> chairman of <unk> vacations <unk> was elected to the board of this cruise line
the board expands to seven members
ducks
if the <unk> <unk> spots one it intends to fire a veto at it
ducks are this season word for new taxes under <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> formulation that if it looks like a duck walks like a duck and quacks like a duck it a duck
<unk> <unk> is quite clear no new ducks
but what about all those non - duck ducks flapping over <unk>
we see a whole flock of programs that will impose significant costs on the american economy in the form of burdensome regulation and higher liabilities
federal child care quack
the <unk> <unk> bill quack
the disabled - workers bill quack quack
the <unk> <unk> <unk> is breeding non - duck ducks the same way n the <unk> <unk> <unk> did it hops on an issue that is unopposable cleaner air better treatment of the disabled better child care
it comes up with a toned - down version of a democratic proposal
the bill gets signed into law and then the administration watches helplessly wondering where all the unexpected costs came from
consider for instance the very fat fowl known as federalized child care
the <unk> came up with a good bill but now may end up signing the awful bureaucratic creature hatched on <unk> <unk>
it would create n local day - care commissions answerable to the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> services
they determine where parents could store their kids during the day and they regulate the storage facilities
the initial costs are said to be in the <unk> billion a year range but that only the beginning
new entitlements tend to grow creating a rationale for new taxes
quack
the administration claims that its clean <unk> bill will cost businesses between n billion and n billion annually but economist <unk> <unk> estimates that the costs for firms will actually be in the <unk> billion a year range
the <unk> bill also distorts economic efficiency in all sorts of perverse ways
for example the administration proposal imposes extremely tough emissions standards on new power plants
so instead of building more efficient modern plants utilities stick scrubbers on the old plants
the money spent on scrubbers is diverted from planned research on new cleaner technology
the bill also imposes the <unk> auto - emissions standards on all cars nationwide as if a car registered in <unk> <unk> <unk> needed to be as clean as one driven in <unk> <unk>
proponents of the nationwide standards say n the cost for car buyers would be about n per car
other analysts say <unk> that estimate is low
quack
nobody knows how many billions of dollars the americans with disabilities <unk> will cost because nobody knows what the bill entails
it is an intentionally vague document that will create a wave of litigation
judges will write the real bill as suits roll through the courts
lawyers will benefit
private companies and ultimately their customers will end up footing the huge bill
the effect of <unk> era non - duck ducks was an economy clogged up with regulations and distortions
all this was recognized and documented in the succeeding years by economists some of whom worked in the <unk> administration to lift this burden from the american people states and local governments
running for <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> also persuasively diagnosed the economic stagnation of the <unk>
in fact during last year campaign the entire nation constantly heard <unk> <unk> tout his accomplishments as head of the <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk>
government continues to inhibit the productivity of our citizenry and the international competitiveness of american business the vice president declared when he was head of the task force
but with the impending passage of these new programs <unk> <unk> will surely be sending many people hurtling back into the regulatory thicket that he had helped cut back
by n the number of federal regulators was down to about <unk>
then it turned up and by one estimate the number will be up to about n regulators by next year
holding the dam on taxes is the most important task of the <unk> presidency
we would have thought by now though that there was a significant core of people involved in government life who understood that direct taxation is n't the only way n to slow down an economy
it is merely the most obvious
what is even more ironic is that all over the world nations are learning that well - intentioned public programs often backfire
but while they are unloading these burdens the <unk> <unk> is close to creating three more big ones
the <unk> administration ought to be setting aside some of its buckshot for the non - duck ducks
