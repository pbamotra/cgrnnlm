<unk> scribes who spare no invective when taking on local luminaries such as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> patriots <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> yesterday poured ridicule on new drawings of <unk> columnists that replaced old photos in the revamped pages this week
by late last night <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> bending to the will of his troops scrapped the new drawings
for a few days at least he says no pictures or drawings of any kind will adorn the columns
trouble was <unk> nobody thought <unk> they looked right
<unk> columnist <unk> <unk> in the second attack on his employer in as many weeks averred that his shadowy countenance was so bad n it looked like a face n you find on a bottle of miracle elixir that promises to do away with diarrhea in our lifetime
<unk> <unk> reminded readers that he still has n't forgiven <unk> management for questioning a n expense chit n he submitted for parking his car while chasing a story
i thought the drawing a cross between someone n you spot whipping open his trench coat or a guy who boasted n he been <unk> <unk> roommate for the last n years he said

instead of buying masks for your kids just cut out the columnists pictures
deeply ingrained in both the book review <unk> <unk> good - bye by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the books reviewed is the assumption that global warming is entirely a result of human activity
is such a view justified
in the absence of humans would the earth enjoy a constant climate over the long term
clearly not
about n years ago the last ice age ended
enormous ice sheets retreated from the face of <unk> <unk> northern <unk> and <unk>
this global warming must have been entirely natural nobody would blame it on a few hundred thousand hunter - gatherers hunting mammoths and scratching around in caves
furthermore no bell has yet rung to announce the end of this immense episode of natural global warming
it is probably continuing and may well account for most of or all of present - day global warming
i bow to no one in my regard for our terrestrial heritage but if we are serious about global warming we must look at the big picture and not allow the <unk> <unk> to lock us into the capitalist - exploiters-greedy-american-consumers-global warming scenario as the sole model for discussion
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the <unk> <unk> <unk> plans to restructure itself more like a private corporation
in addition the tax - collecting agency says that it will take the unusual step of looking to the private sector to fill two new high - level positions n to guide the n agency a comptroller <unk> to oversee daily finances and a chief information officer <unk> to update the information system which includes probably the largest computer data base in the world
the <unk> also said that it would create the position of chief financial officer who will be hired from within the agency
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said n the changes are intended to bring accountability to the agency which has an annual budget of more than n billion and collects about <unk> trillion a year
my assessment and everyone assessment is that we do not have the kinds of information that let us responsibly and effectively formulate and execute our budget <unk> <unk> said
and we do n't have internal controls and discipline that we need to have to spend n billion properly
<unk> <unk> who took over as head of the <unk> in <unk> has been disturbed by what he considers the inefficiency waste and lack of coordination among the branches of the vast federal agency
the <unk> operates on a computer system designed in n which it has been trying to modernize for years
and the agency which operated throughout fiscal n with a n million budget shortfall has been under a hiring freeze since last fall
the new commissioner says that closer scrutiny of how the agency uses its resources will go a long way toward enhancing its ability to collect more tax revenue
i think that you will see a significant improvement in the budget formulation and execution process which in turn i believe n will result in a significant increase in revenue he said
the <unk> hopes to fill the new positions soon
customarily it would appoint career civil servants from within the agency but <unk> <unk> said <unk> he plans to scour the world for the chief information officer and the comptroller
although the jobs will probably pay between <unk> and <unk> a year <unk> officials are confident that they can attract top - notch candidates from the private sector
you telling someone n they can spend the next three or four or five or six years of their life bringing about the most difficult and costly modernization of an information system on the civil side ever <unk> <unk> said
on the comptroller side you developing and making work financial controls governing a n billion budget
when <unk> . <unk> <unk> the leader of the abortive coup in <unk> was buried his body bore several gunshot wounds a cracked skull and broken legs and ribs
they were the signature of his adversary panamanian leader <unk> <unk> <unk>
the rebel officer slow and painful death at the headquarters of <unk> <unk> squad was personally supervised by <unk> <unk> says <unk> a <unk> official with access to intelligence reports
leaping into rages sinking into bouts of drunkenness and mistrust <unk> <unk> has put to death some n of his troops involved in the coup according to <unk> officials monitoring crematoriums and funeral parlors in <unk> <unk>
he is now changing the place n he sleeps every night sometimes more than once a night
his meals are most often prepared by women n he trusts his full - time mistress <unk> <unk> and her mother <unk>
and he is collecting the names of those who telephoned the coup - makers to congratulate them during their brief time in control of his headquarters
more enemies n to be dealt with
in the two weeks since the rebellion which the <unk> hesitantly backed <unk> <unk> has been at his most brutal and efficient in maintaining power
yet while the failed coup is a major <unk> foreign policy embarrassment it is merely the latest chapter in a byzantine relationship between <unk> <unk> and <unk> that stretches back three decades
<unk> war on the dictator over the past two years following his indictment on drug charges in <unk> n is the legacy of that relationship
before american foreign policy set out to destroy <unk> it helped create him out of the crucible of <unk> long history of conspirators and pirates
for most of the past <unk> years the marriage was one of convenience
in <unk> for example when <unk> <unk> was both a cadet at an elite military academy in <unk> and a spy - in-training for the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> he was detained by <unk> authorities for allegedly raping and savagely beating a prostitute according to a <unk> <unk> cable from that period
the woman had nearly died
but <unk> intelligence rather than rein in or cut loose its new spy merely filed the report away
<unk> <unk> tips on emerging leftists at his school were deemed more important to <unk> interests
from that point on the <unk> would make a practice of overlooking the panamanian misadventures
the <unk> has befriended and later turned against many dictators but none quite so resourceful
the <unk> <unk> <unk> is n't as smooth as the shah of <unk> as well - born as <unk> <unk> <unk> as imperial as <unk> <unk> of the philippines or as bloody as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
yet he has proved more resilient than any of them
and out of necessity the <unk> can make mistakes and still hope to remove him from power but a single error on his part could cost him his life
the <unk> underestimated <unk> all along says <unk> <unk> a former <unk> to <unk>
he has mastered the art of survival
in keeping with <unk> long history of propping up <unk> <unk> recent <unk> actions have extended rather than shortened his survival
<unk> <unk> might have fallen of his own weight in <unk> because of <unk> dire economic situation says <unk> <unk> <unk> but increasing external pressure has only given him additional excuses for repression and a scapegoat for his own mismanagement
if the <unk> had sat back and done nothing he might not have made it through <unk> <unk> <unk> contends
perhaps most important <unk> <unk> allies have intervened to encourage in some cases to demand that the dictator maintain his grip of the throne
one colombian drug boss upon hearing in <unk> that <unk> <unk> was negotiating with the <unk> to abandon his command for a comfortable exile sent him a hand - sized mahogany coffin engraved with his name
he is cornered says the <unk> <unk> <unk> who has led <unk> <unk> opposition against <unk>
the americans have left him without a way out
it is easy to fight when you do n't have any other option
his chief advantage in the fight his intimate knowledge of american ways and weaknesses
<unk> <unk> often tells friends that patience is the best weapon against the gringos who have a short attention span and little stomach for lasting confrontation
the <unk> discovered the young <unk> <unk> in late n when he was in his second year at the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> according to former <unk> intelligence officials
the contact occurred through <unk> <unk> half - brother a panamanian diplomat based in <unk> named <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> knowing that helping the americans could advance the career of any panamanian officer relayed <unk> reports on the leftist tendencies n he observed among his fellow students and more important among his officers and instructors
a spy was born
it was a heady experience for the pockmarked and slightly built <unk> <unk> who was known to his friends as <unk> la <unk> pineapple face
born the illegitimate son of his father maid he was raised on the mean streets of the central market district of <unk> <unk>
<unk> was four years older than most of his fellow cadets and gained admission to the academy because his brother had falsified his birth certificate
he considered himself intellectually superior to his peruvian peers many of whom were wayward sons sent by their well - off families to the highly disciplined <unk> - modeled academy as a sort of reform school
in his peaked military cap and neatly pressed <unk> - made uniform <unk> felt more respected and powerful than ever in his underprivileged life friends from the period say n
he had an elegant uniform with gold buttons in a country where there was a cult of militarism where officers were the elite with special privileges recalls <unk> <unk> a fellow student in <unk> and a lifelong friend
<unk> <unk> relationship to american intelligence agencies became contractual in either <unk> or <unk> intelligence officials say n
his commanding officer at the <unk> <unk> garrison <unk> <unk> <unk> gave him an intriguing assignment <unk> <unk> would organize the province first intelligence service
the spy network would serve two clients the panamanian government by monitoring political opponents in the region and the <unk> by tracking the growing communist influence in the unions organized at <unk> <unk> <unk> banana plantations in <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> was one of the two largest contributors to <unk> national income
satisfying its interests was a priority for any panamanian leader
<unk> <unk> initial retainer was only <unk> to n a month plus occasional gifts of liquor or groceries from the american <unk> a former intelligence official says <unk>
it was modest pay by american standards but a healthy boost to his small military salary which fellow officers remember as having been <unk> to n monthly
he did it very well recalls <unk> <unk> a former panamanian colonel who managed <unk> <unk> and his operation
he started building the files that helped him gain power
a <unk> <unk> job assumed by <unk> . <unk> in <unk> as chief of the transit police in <unk> <unk> capital of the <unk> <unk> was tailor - made for an aspiring super - spy
by pressuring taxi and bus drivers who needed licenses he gained a ready cache of information
he knew which local luminaries had been caught driving drunk which had been found with their mistresses
this proved particularly valuable to the panamanian government in <unk> when union leaders were planning a <unk> <unk> march that the government feared n could turn violent
<unk> <unk> had learned that a local union leader was sleeping with the wife of his deputy
so he splashed the information on handbills that he distributed throughout the banana - exporting city of <unk> <unk> which was ruled by <unk> <unk> <unk>
the campaign so divided union leaders that the government found them far easier n to control
it was like a play on <unk> recalls <unk> <unk>
<unk> managed the whole thing
he was superb
<unk> was an expert at bribing and blackmailing people
during his years in <unk> however <unk> <unk> also revealed himself as an officer as perverse as he was ingenious
<unk> <unk> a local lawyer and human - rights monitor recalls an intoxicated <unk> visiting prisoners in their cells at the <unk> <unk> <unk> headquarters in <unk> where he had his offices
<unk> <unk> would order them all to take off their clothes and run around the courtyard naked laughing at them and then retreating to his office
people started wondering if something was wrong with him <unk> <unk> recalls
but through this period so far as the <unk> military was concerned <unk> <unk> was a model recruit
he signed up for intelligence and counter - intelligence training under american officers at <unk> <unk> in <unk> in <unk> <unk> according to a copy of a <unk> resume with details n <unk> <unk> has since classified as secret
he flew to <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> of that year for a course in psychological operations returning to the <unk> of the americas in <unk> for a two - month course called military intelligence for officers
some american officers interpreted his eagerness and studiousness as a sign of loyalty but they did so falsely
he rose to chief of intelligence in <unk> socalled <unk> in <unk> after providing populist dictator <unk> the critical support to defeat a coup attempt against him a year earlier
he became <unk> <unk> inseparable shadow and the holder of all <unk> secrets
<unk> <unk> by now a lieutenant colonel expanded his contacts to include the cubans not to mention the israelis the taiwanese and any other intelligence service that came knocking
when <unk> diplomats complained to the <unk> of <unk> . <unk> moonlighting intelligence experts always insisted that his allegiance was first to the americans
early on in the <unk> <unk> we took to calling him the rent - a-colonel in tribute to his ability to simultaneously milk the antagonistic intelligence services of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> recalls <unk> <unk> <unk> who as deputy assistant secretary of state for inter - american affairs first ran across reports about <unk> <unk> in <unk>
some of us wondered how our intelligence people could put so much stock in his information when he was just as close to the cubans
even at this early stage drugs caused additional concerns
during the <unk> administration the <unk> <unk> <unk> became dismayed at the extent of the <unk> connections to arrested drug traffickers
one <unk> agent drew up a list of five options for dealing with <unk> . <unk> one of which was assassination
the head of the <unk> at the time <unk> <unk> scotched the assassination plan
but he did fly to <unk> to scold dictator <unk> on the drug ties of panamanian officials including <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> later recalled that <unk> <unk> seemed afraid to act on the concerns of the <unk>
everybody was afraid of him <unk> <unk> says
<unk> <unk> became an even greater threat in <unk> when <unk> intelligence services discovered that he had been buying recordings of electronically monitored conversations from three sergeants working for the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the tapes included wiretaps of <unk> <unk> own phone according to american intelligence officials
we caught him with his hands on our cookie jar says former <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
for the first time the <unk> considered cutting <unk> <unk> from its intelligence payroll and the deliberations were intense <unk> <unk> says <unk>
in the world of intelligence if you want to get information you get it from seedy characters
the question is how much you get tied in with seedy characters so they can extort you
intelligence officials to this day worry whether <unk> <unk> sold sensitive information on the recordings to the cubans or others
<unk> <unk> was troubled enough to cancel the <unk> contract with the rent - a-colonel at the beginning of the <unk> administration
the <unk> soon found new cause for concern gun - running
prosecutors in <unk> <unk> indicted five panamanians on charges of illegally running arms to <unk> rebels trying to overthrow the nicaraguan government of <unk> <unk>
they included one of <unk> <unk> closest friends and business partners <unk> <unk>
and the investigators were quickly closing in on <unk> <unk> himself
at the time though in <unk> the <unk> was once again flirting with its longtime latin american spy
<unk> <unk> made plans to fly to <unk> for a meeting with his counterpart at the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and federal authorities learning that he intended to fly through <unk> made plans to arrest him on the gun - running charges as soon as he hit <unk> soil
it was a <unk> in <unk>
the <unk> foiled the plan
according to military officers at the time word was passed to <unk> <unk> by his american hosts that the police would be waiting
on <unk> <unk> officials received a routine unclassified message from the military group commander in <unk>
due to health reasons <unk> . <unk> . <unk> has elected to postpone his visit to <unk> it read
prosecutors in <unk> received yet another setback
their original indictment against <unk> <unk> the friend of <unk> <unk> and the other four was dismissed on a technicality
but now along with reindicting <unk> <unk> pal they intended to charge <unk> <unk> himself on allegations that he was involved in the illegal trading of some n million in arms
in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as assistant <unk> attorney was summoned to a meeting with a <unk> <unk> of <unk> agent assigned to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and firearms in <unk>
panamanian dictator <unk> he was told <unk> had granted the shah of <unk> asylum in <unk> as a favor to <unk>
<unk> <unk> was told <unk> <unk> <unk> friend <unk> <unk> would be handling the shah security
it would n't be a good idea to indict him much less <unk> <unk> the prosecutor was told <unk>
after prodding from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> pleaded with <unk> <unk> officials in <unk> to let the indictment proceed
unfortunately <unk> <unk> wrote <unk> in a letter those of us in law enforcement in <unk> find ourselves frequently attempting to enforce the laws of the <unk> <unk> but simultaneously being caught between foreign policy considerations over which we have no control
the letter along with a detailed prosecution memo sat on the desks of <unk> officials for months before the case died a quiet death
i think n if we had been allowed to go ahead then we would n't have the problems n we have now <unk> <unk> says
if he had been found guilty we could have stopped him
in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> took over as <unk> and <unk> - facto dictator of <unk> having maneuvered his way to the top only two years after the mysterious death in a plane crash of his old boss <unk> <unk>
soon the military became a veritable mafia controlling legal and illegal businesses
the <unk> administration also put <unk> <unk> <unk> back on the <unk> payroll
payments averaged nearly n a year from the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk>
although working for <unk> intelligence <unk> <unk> was hardly helping the <unk> exclusively
during the <unk> years he expanded his business and intelligence contacts with the cubans and the sandinistas
he allegedly entered into <unk> first formal business arrangement with colombian drug bosses according to <unk> <unk> a pilot who once worked for <unk> <unk> and who testified before the <unk> grand jury in <unk> that would ultimately indict the <unk> on drug charges
but <unk> <unk> was convinced n the <unk> <unk> <unk> would n't act against him recalls <unk> his close ally <unk> <unk> because he had an insurance policy his involvement with the <unk> rebels in <unk>
<unk> <unk> says <unk> the general allowed the contras to set up a secret training center in <unk>
<unk> <unk> also conveyed intelligence from his spy operation inside the nicaraguan capital of <unk>
and on at least one occasion in the spring of <unk> he helped arrange a sabotage attack on a <unk> arsenal in <unk>
although his help for the <unk> cause was limited it was enough to win him important protectors in the <unk> administration says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> who then served on the <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> played <unk> intelligence agencies and the <unk> government like a violin he says
an incident in <unk> suggested one additional means by which <unk> <unk> might have maintained such influence with <unk> by compromising <unk> officials
<unk> <unk> then the ambassador to <unk> <unk> recalls being invited to <unk> by <unk> <unk> brother <unk> <unk> for a weekend of deep sea fishing and quiet serious conversation on the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> notified <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> ambassador to <unk> of the invitation
<unk> screamed <unk> <unk> recalls
he says <unk> <unk> <unk> told him n he was being set up for a honey trap in which <unk> <unk> would try to involve him in an orgy and then record the event with sound and video
<unk> <unk> on vacation after resigning his position at the <unk> <unk> <unk> could n't be reached for comment
as <unk> <unk> political troubles grew so did his offers of assistance to the contras an apparent attempt to curry more favor in <unk>
for instance he helped steal the <unk> <unk> panamanian elections for the ruling party
but just one month later he also contributed n to a <unk> leader according to documents released for <unk> <unk> criminal trial in <unk> <unk>
yet his political setbacks mounted
<unk> <unk> was accused of ordering in <unk> the beheading of <unk> <unk> his most outspoken political opponent and the first man <unk> to publicly finger <unk> <unk> on drug trafficking charges
he then ousted <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a former <unk> <unk> official with close ties to the <unk> after <unk> <unk> tried to create a commission to investigate the murder
and all the while <unk> debt problems continued to grow
<unk> <unk> was growing desperate
in late n he made an offer n he thought <unk> the <unk> could n't refuse
as recounted in a stipulation that summarized government documents released for the <unk> trial <unk> <unk> offered to assassinate the <unk> leadership in exchange for a promise to help clean up <unk> image and a commitment to lift the <unk> ban on military sales to the <unk> <unk> forces
<unk> the document went on referring to <unk> <unk> has told <unk> representative that <unk> law forbade such actions
the representative responded that <unk> had numerous assets in place in <unk> and could accomplish many essential things just as <unk> had helped the <unk> the previous year in blowing up a <unk> arsenal
<unk> . <unk> conveyed the request to his superiors and to <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> who relayed it to <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> proposal was turned down
and <unk> <unk> curtly told <unk> <unk> that the general should be told that only he could repair his tarnished image
the end of the marriage was at hand
within weeks the unfolding <unk> - <unk> scandal took away <unk> <unk> insurance policy
the death of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and resignation of <unk> <unk> allowed anti - noriega political forces to gain influence

during negotiations with american officials in <unk> n over proposals to drop the <unk> indictments in exchange for his resignation <unk> <unk> often asked almost plaintively how the americans whom he had helped for so many years could turn against him
now neither side the <unk> nor <unk> <unk> has an easy out
<unk> <unk> has sworn to bring him to justice
<unk> <unk> believes <unk> he has n't any alternative but to continue clutching to power
it is a knock - out battle perhaps to the death
in the end is <unk> <unk> the political equivalent of <unk> monster created by a well - intentioned but misguided foreign power
not quite <unk> <unk> contends <unk>
for short - term gains people were willing to put up with him
that allowed him to get stronger and stronger he says
i do n't think n we created him as much as we fed him nurtured him and let him grow up to be big and strong

the <unk> <unk> <unk> said n output of the nation factories mines and utilities expanded at an annual rate of n in the third quarter substantially slower than the n annual rate in the second quarter
capital spending and exports which have been the driving force in this expansion are showing clear signs of having the steam taken out of them said <unk> <unk> economist for <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>
the new reports of sluggishness which were foreshadowed by an earlier <unk> <unk> report that manufacturing payrolls dropped by <unk> in <unk> give the <unk> another reason to further ease its grip on credit and lower interest rates
they need to do something about this said <unk> <unk> economist at <unk> <unk> <unk>

measures of manufacturing activity fell more than the overall measures
factory output dropped <unk> its first decline since <unk> after having been unchanged in <unk>
factories operated at <unk> of capacity the lowest rate in more than a year and down from <unk> in <unk>
the declines mainly reflected widespread weakness in durable goods those intended to last more than three years
the biggest drop was recorded by primary metals producers a category that includes the steel industry
output of business equipment was unchanged in <unk>
production of factory equipment one indication of the strength of manufacturers investment spending fell n
some economists expect further declines in investment spending
whenever corporate profits are weak that means n capital spending is going to soften subsequently <unk> <unk> said
you have n't seen the full effect of that yet

lung - cancer mortality rates for people under n years of age have begun to decline federal researchers report n
the drop is particularly large for white males although black males and white and black women also show lower mortality rates
a report in this week issue of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> also projects that overall <unk> mortality rates from lung cancer the leading cause of cancer death should begin to drop in several years if cigarette smoking continues to abate
the report which comes n years after the <unk> <unk> <unk> issued a report warning against the dangers of smoking is the strongest indication to date that the reduction in smoking is leading to lower death rates from lung cancer
what this is saying is that the surgeon general message is having an impact said <unk> <unk> an epidemiologist at the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> in <unk>
the <unk> <unk> <unk> report compares mortality rates of two groups of people between the ages of <unk> and <unk> a decade apart
the death rate from lung cancer of white males aged <unk> to <unk> in the <unk> was n per n but the mortality rate of the same age group in the <unk> was <unk> a decline of <unk>
measured the same way the decline for black males was n
the drop in mortality rates for women was less steep n for blacks and n for whites
the study by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of the institute staff also shows that the incidence of lung cancer as well as the death rate declined over the decade for all groups in the n age bracket except black men
although lung - cancer mortality rates are increasing for the nation as a whole the report projects that death rates will begin to decline in the n for men and after the year n for women
lung - cancer mortality rates increase with age and are continuing to rise for all age groups over n with sharp increases for everybody but white men
but <unk> <unk> one of the authors of the report said the declining rates n we seeing for younger people we believe may be a harbinger of declining mortality in the future
however he stressed that the improvement depends on a continued reduction in smoking
even though these favorable trends in lung - cancer mortality affect all sex and race groups they ca n't be taken for granted the report says
smoking prevention programs should reach larger segments of the population especially children adolescents and minorities
an editorial in the <unk> <unk> says <unk> the report of declining lung - cancer mortality among young men and women in the <unk> indicates that we finally may be winning the battle this even in a country where the tobacco industry spends over <unk> billion a year for promotion of the addictive habit of smoking
but the editorial by <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> notes that tobacco consumption and lung - cancer mortality rates are rising in developing countries
<unk> - smoking should be established as the norm of social behavior around the world the editorial says n through the enactment of laws that limit advertising boost tobacco prices and promote anti - smoking education
asked for comment <unk> <unk> a vice president of the <unk> <unk> said <unk> new efforts to restrict tobacco advertising in the <unk> could violate the <unk> <unk> protection of free speech
according to the <unk> <unk> <unk> smoking is responsible for <unk> of the lung - cancer cases among men and n among women
the <unk> report attributes the differences in mortality rates by race to different smoking patterns
a higher proportion of black men smoke than white men
while nearly equal percentages of black and white women currently smoke in both sexes more whites have given up smoking than blacks
in comparing changes in mortality rates over the past decade the <unk> study looked only at blacks and whites
asians and native americans were n't studied hispanics were included with whites

your story missed some essential points of the conference on <unk> <unk> <unk> are we overreacting
first and foremost the vignettes presented by the various scientists represent a general consensus among specialists working in the respective aspects of the global environment
consider for example the greenhouse effect and climate change numerous blue - ribbon scientific committees including one from the <unk> <unk> of <unk> judge n there is a greater than n probability of a grave problem in the offing
the point was to answer the question in the conference title not to try to create news stories for the event itself
nor was it intended to dictate a set of prescriptive solutions although various points were raised
each speaker was asked to address a specific topic not deliver a point of view
each scientist independently concluded n society and government are underreacting when it comes to substantive policy change
this leads to a very special sense of urgency
if the media decide to work harder at educating the public about these complex and technical issues that hardly can be termed non - objective journalism
the environment can no longer be a normal issue to be dealt with on a business - as-usual basis with comfortable increments of change
we have literally altered the chemistry and physics of our planet atmosphere
this portends consequences from what we have already done that will be very destabilizing to social and economic systems
the problems of the environment are so interrelated so inextricably entwined with our current way of life and so large that it is unlikely n we will be able to address them effectively unless major changes are made in less than n years
the consensus from the scientific community is that there is sufficient evidence to advise major policy changes
no we are not overreacting

the youthful audience for <unk> programming is no longer dependent on the networks

this is written to correct a misquotation in your <unk> n article deaths from advanced <unk> cancer can be reduced by using two drugs
in this article i was alleged to have said <unk> any patient with high - risk colon cancer is really getting short shrift if he not getting this therapy
i did n't say this and i totally opposed to the philosophy expressed by the quote
i have not offered and will not offer routine therapy with the two drugs levamisole and <unk> to any of my colon - cancer patients
with this treatment we have reduced deaths in high - risk colon cancer by one - third but this leaves the two - thirds who are dying of cancer
this is not nearly good enough
i believe <unk> any physician who truly cares about cancer patients both today and tomorrow should offer the hope of something better than that
my statement read verbatim from a printed text available to all reporters attending the <unk> <unk> <unk> news conference was the following new clinical trials are already in operation seeking to improve these results
these research protocols offer to the patient not only the very best therapy which we have established today but also the hope of something still better
i feel n any patient with high - risk cancer is getting short shrift if he is not offered this opportunity
we have very exciting prospects for far more impressive advances in the treatment of colon cancer during the years immediately ahead
this hope however will never be realized if we use levamisole and <unk> as a stopping point

the oil and auto industries united in their dislike of <unk> <unk> proposal for cars that run on alternative fuels announced a joint research program that could turn up a cleaner - burning gasoline
officials of the <unk> <unk> auto makers and n petroleum companies said <unk> they are setting out to find the most cost - effective fuel for reducing cities air - pollution problems with no bias toward any fuel in particular
however their search notably wo n't include natural gas or pure methanol the two front - running alternative fuels in tests <unk> to be completed by next summer
instead the tests will focus heavily on new blends of gasoline which are still undeveloped but which the petroleum industry has been touting as a solution for automobile pollution that is choking urban areas
environmentalists criticized the program as merely a public - relations attempt to head off a <unk> <unk> proposal to require a million cars a year that run on cleaner - burning fuels by n
while major oil companies have been experimenting with cleaner - burning gasoline blends for years only <unk> <unk> <unk> is now marketing a lower - emission gasoline for older cars currently running on leaded fuel
the initial n million research program will conduct the most extensive testing to date of reformulated gasolines said <unk> <unk> <unk> head of fuels and lubricants at <unk> motors <unk> research laboratories
it will compare <unk> different blends of gasolines with three mixtures of up to <unk> methanol
a second phase of research which is still being planned will test reformulated gasolines on newer engine technologies now being developed for use in <unk> or <unk> cars
there was no cost estimate for the second phase
the whole idea here is <unk> the automobile and oil companies have joint customers said <unk> <unk> a senior vice president of technology at <unk> <unk>
and we are looking for the most cost - effective way n to clean up the air
but <unk> hawkins an environmental lawyer with the <unk> resources <unk> <unk> said <unk> the research appears merely to be a way n to promote reformulated gasoline
oil and auto companies supported a move on <unk> <unk> last week to gut <unk> <unk> plans to require auto makers to begin selling alternative - fueled cars by <unk>
instead a <unk> subcommittee adopted a clean - fuels program that specifically mentions reformulated gasoline as an alternative
the <unk> administration has said <unk> it will try to resurrect its plan when the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> takes up a comprehensive clean - air bill

he made his comments before <unk> <unk> <unk> hearings to investigate what appears to be the biggest thrift disaster in a scandal - ridden industry
the inquiry also will cover the actions of <unk> <unk> <unk> who is chairman of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> parent and who contributed heavily to several <unk> senators
<unk> <unk> told the committee that the <unk> <unk> <unk> the agency created to sell sick thrifts has studied <unk> examination reports by former regulators dating back to n
my staff indicated that had we made such findings in one of our own institutions we would have sought an immediate cease - and-desist order to stop the hazardous operations <unk> <unk> said
when <unk> was seized by the government for example n of its loans or n million were to borrowers who were buying real estate from one of <unk> <unk> <unk> other subsidiaries according to <unk> <unk>
but the government did n't step in until six months ago when thrift officials put <unk> into conservatorship the day after <unk> <unk> filed for chapter n bankruptcy protection from creditors
the bankruptcy filing the government has charged <unk> in a <unk> billion civil lawsuit was part of a pattern to shift insured deposits to the parent company which used the deposits as a cache for real - estate deals
the deposits that have been transferred to other subsidiaries are now under the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court
i think n it fairly clear <unk> <unk> <unk> knew that regulators were set to seize <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk>
further investigation he said n may result in further actions against <unk> executives said <unk> <unk> <unk> including fraud actions
<unk> <unk> for his part has filed suit alleging that regulators unlawfully seized the thrift
<unk> <unk> an attorney in <unk> for <unk> <unk> declined to comment on the hearings except to say n we will be responding comprehensively in several forums to each of these allegations at the appropriate time
<unk> treatment by former thrift regulators in an agency disbanded by the new law has proved embarrassing for five senators who received thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> said yesterday for example that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who received n in contributions from <unk> <unk> phoned <unk> <unk> to request that he push for a sale of <unk> before it would be seized
after the government lawsuit was filed against <unk> <unk> <unk> returned the campaign contributions
the senator spokesman said yesterday that he pushed for the sale of <unk> because hundreds of <unk> jobs at <unk> were on the line

<unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> also received substantial contributions from <unk> <unk> and sought to intervene on behalf of <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said n <unk> <unk> volunteered to appear before the <unk> committee if necessary
but a committee staff member said <unk> the panel is unlikely to pursue closely the role of the senators
at the hearing <unk> <unk> said <unk> the <unk> has already pumped n million into <unk> for liquidity
he also held out little hope of restitution for purchasers of n million in <unk> <unk> subordinated debt
some of those debtholders have filed a suit saying n they believed n they were buying government - insured certificates of deposit

<unk> <unk> creditors committee unhappy with the carrier plans for emerging from bankruptcy - law proceedings asked its own experts to devise alternate approaches to a reorganization
representatives of the accounting firm of <unk> <unk> and the securities firm of <unk> <unk> <unk> hired by creditors to consult on eastern financial plans told the committee in a private meeting yesterday that <unk> latest plan to emerge from bankruptcy - law protection is far riskier than an earlier one which won the creditors approval
according to one person present at the meeting eastern new plan is financially overly optimistic
asked about the consultants reports an <unk> spokeswoman said n we totally disagree
she said n they have oversimplified and made some erroneous assumptions that make their analysis completely off - base
at a later news conference here <unk> <unk> chairman of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> was exceeding its goals for getting back into operation and predicted n it would emerge from chapter n protection from creditors early next year operating with more service than it originally had scheduled
he insisted as he has before that creditors would be paid in full under the plan
<unk> <unk> made no mention of creditors negative response to his plan
we in the process of discussing an amended plan with the creditors and anticipate filing that amended plan shortly <unk> <unk> told reporters
we meeting and surpassing our goals he added
in <unk> <unk> and its creditors agreed on a reorganization plan that called for <unk> to sell n billion in assets and to emerge from bankruptcy - law protection at two - thirds its former size
but after selling off pieces such as its <unk> <unk> shuttle its <unk> hub and various planes <unk> hit a stumbling block
it could n't sell its south american routes one of the major assets marked for disposal
those routes valued by the creditors professionals at about n million were to be sold to <unk> <unk> <unk> airlines
a last - minute snag in negotiations with <unk> over an unrelated lawsuit between american and another <unk> <unk> unit caused the deal to collapse
<unk> ultimately decided n it would have to keep and operate the routes itself which would leave it with less cash for its reorganization
it also would leave <unk> a bigger carrier than the scaled - down one proposed under the initial plan
those changes in its condition meant n the reorganization plan previously presented to creditors would have to be revamped
since then <unk> has been negotiating with creditors over revisions but the creditors committee has been having problems with the revisions
the committee has two groups of experts n it calls on to analyze eastern plans
both said <unk> the new plan would n't work
<unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> plans will miss its projections of earnings before interest tax and depreciation by n million and that <unk> plan presented no comfort level according to a source present at yesterday session
experts from <unk> <unk> estimated <unk> <unk> would miss the same mark by n million to n million the source said
the experts said n they expected <unk> <unk> would have to issue new debt to cover its costs and that it would generate far less cash than <unk> anticipated
other costs also would increase including maintenance because <unk> has an older fleet
at the news conference <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> presented a far rosier assessment
flanked by flight attendants pilots and gate agents dressed in spiffy new blue uniforms they said <unk> <unk> has exceeded its operational goals and is filling its seats
starting next month <unk> will begin flying n flights daily instead of the previously announced <unk> they said n
<unk> <unk> declined to give out eastern daily losses but said <unk> he did n't expect <unk> <unk> would have to dip into the cash from asset sales currently held in escrow
these accounts hold several hundred million dollars primarily from asset sales
the plan n <unk> hopes to pursue he said n calls for <unk> to have n million in cash by year end
both he and <unk> <unk> predicted n that plan might be confirmed in <unk>
as to negotiations with creditors <unk> <unk> said in remarks after the conference n we have to see how they talks come along
however he added it not a requirement that the plan be accepted by creditors
it must be accepted by the court
under bankruptcy law <unk> has exclusive rights for a certain period to develop its own reorganization plan
that deadline has been extended once and could be extended again
if <unk> can get creditor support court confirmation of its plan could be relatively swift
but creditors are free to press for court approval of their own plan or the court could ignore both sides and draw its own
in any event some people familiar with the case question whether the court will act by <unk> as forecast by <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> sought bankruptcy - law protection a few days after a crippling strike began <unk> n
<unk> <unk> told reporters n the reorganization <unk> <unk> is pursuing would create a carrier <unk> to n of the size of the pre - bankruptcy <unk>
he projected n it would be operating about <unk> flights a day by late spring only slightly fewer than the carrier old volume of <unk> a day
hopes of simplifying the corporate minimum tax before <unk> are weakening
the method of calculating the <unk> tax paid if it exceeds tax figured the regular way is due for a change in <unk> thanks to <unk> tax act
but most experts agree that the concept that is to be introduced drags in great complexity they have been trying to head it off this year
ways and means <unk> <unk> backed a simplification plan in the pending <unk> tax bill but the plan turns out to be a big revenue loser
now the <unk> stripped - down bill omits any proposal to deal with the corporate tax
proponents of simplification fear that the chances of getting it into the final bill are waning
we hear <unk> it has low priority on the <unk> side says <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> cpas
if the law is n't changed he says n we are left staring at rules that are almost impossible n to implement because there are so many complex depreciation calculations n to do
but <unk> still could resolve the issue with other legislation this year or next <unk> adds <unk>
<unk> ravages may be offset by immediate claims for tax refunds
this law aids hurricane - wracked locales named by the president as disaster areas as well as regions so designated after other n disasters
it lets victims elect to deduct casualty losses on either <unk> or amended <unk> returns whichever offers the larger tax benefit they have until <unk> n to choose
amending a n return to claim a refund brings cash faster but for personal losses there are other factors n to consider notes n publisher <unk> <unk>
a loss after insurance recoveries is deductible only to the extent that it exceeds <unk> and that the year total losses exceed <unk> of adjusted gross income victims may pick the year when income is lower and deductions higher
in filing an original not amended return a couple should consider whether damaged property is owned jointly or separately and whether one spouse has larger income that may determine whether they should file jointly or separately
the <unk> delays several deadlines for <unk> victims
returns for n from people with six - month filing extensions were due <unk> but the <unk> says n people in the disaster areas wo n't be penalized for late filing if their returns are marked <unk> and postmarked by <unk> n
interest will be imposed on unpaid taxes but late - payment penalties on the returns will be waived if the balance due and paid is <unk> or less of the liability
<unk> <unk> <unk> describes this and other deadline relief for <unk> victims

bigger than a breadbox was this cash hoarder reputation for honesty
people often cite frugality and distrust of banks to justify cash caches to the <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> a hardworking reclusive young bachelor told that story to the <unk> <unk>
but judges usually find n the real aim is to escape tax on hidden income and the <unk> said <unk> <unk> must have had such income although it uncovered no source because he deposited n in a bank account in <unk> while reporting income of only n
<unk> story
the deposits came from savings kept in a <unk> breadbox he saved <unk> in <unk> by living with family members and pinching pennies and <unk> of secret gifts from his remorseful father who had abandoned the family in <unk>
<unk> had no proof but testimony of his mother and stepmother about his father and of an ex - employer about his honesty and habits satisfied a judge that <unk> was truthful and his tale of gifts was possible
the <unk> offered no evidence of hidden sources of taxable income so <unk> <unk> rejected its claims
briefs

<unk> <unk> mounts her bicycle and grinds up yet another steep rocky path seemingly suitable only for mountain goats
after a tortuous climb she is rewarded by a picture - postcard vista a glade of golden aspens under an azure indian - summer sky
this place is n miles into the back country a day - long trudge for a hiker but reached by <unk> <unk> and six others in a mere two hours of pedaling fat - tired mountain bikes
this says <unk> <unk> is what it all about
twelve hundred miles away rangers at a <unk> <unk> <unk> state park are among the many who do n't quite share the enthusiasm
this summer speeding bikers were blamed for an accident in the <unk> <unk> park in which a horse spooked on a trail that was closed to bikers broke its leg
the animal had to be destroyed the bikers fled and were never found
in numerous parks near <unk> <unk> rangers have been forced to close trails set up speed traps and use radar guns to curb fast and reckless riding
they have even sent helicopters in pursuit of bikers after hikers and equestrians complained n they were being driven from trails
we were being overrun says <unk> <unk> trails coordinator of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
two years ago the district decided to limit the bikes to fire roads in its <unk> hilly acres
from about n six years ago the number of mountain bikes in the <unk> is expected to grow to n million in <unk>
at least half that growth will have come in the past three years alone
the controversy kicked up by the proliferation of these all - terrain bicycles is one of the most divisive storms n to blow through the national conservation movement in recent memory
bikers many of them ardent environmentalists proclaim their sport an efficient safe fitness - promoting way n to get back to nature while asserting a right as taxpayers to pedal on public lands
but the bikes burgeoning numbers safety concerns and fear that they damage fragile landscapes have prompted pleas from the sierras to the <unk> <unk> to ban them from the back country
key to the issue is that the bikes in skillful hands can go virtually anywhere and in reckless hands can become vehicles of terror
an adept bicyclist can leap from a dead stop to the top of a picnic table without losing balance
such skills allow riders to fly down treacherous mountain grades at speeds of up to <unk> miles an hour a thrill for the cyclist but a nightmare for unsuspecting hikers or equestrians
for harried public - land managers across the nation the response is increasingly to shut the gates
the state of <unk> following the lead of some regional parks recently adopted regulations that closed nearly all hiking paths in state parks to mountain bicycles
the move largely consigns them to roads used by motorized vehicles
most other states have enacted similar bans
the bikes are unwelcome on trails in national parks
even the <unk> <unk> <unk> whose lenient multiple - use philosophy permits motorized vehicles on thousands of miles of its trails across the <unk> has begun to close some lands to the bikes including major portions of the popular <unk> <unk> <unk> which stretches from <unk> to <unk>
often these closings come after vigorous anti - bike lobbying by conservation organizations the politically potent <unk> <unk> among them
<unk> has been instrumental in securing a number of the <unk> bans
it has been waging an all - out campaign to beat back a proposal pushed by <unk> bike groups to allow the cycles in federally designated wilderness areas where they are now prohibited
yet <unk> hard - line stance has created something of a rift in the organization which estimates that <unk> of its <unk> members own mountain bikes
pressure from these members prompted the club recently to soften its anti - bike rhetoric it no longer for example lumps the bikes into the same category as motorcycles and other terrain - marring off - road vehicles
but the club still insists that public lands ought to be closed to the bikes unless studies indicate n the bikes wo n't injure the environment or other users
i have a mountain bike yet as a hiker i been run off the road by kids careening down a fire trail on them says <unk> <unk> an official at <unk> headquarters in <unk> <unk> echoing the concerns of many members
people who feel that cyclists should be banned from an area are n't looking at the whole picture complains <unk> <unk> associate editor of <unk> and <unk> <unk> magazine in <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is among the legions of bikers who got their first taste of wilderness as hikers or backpackers
he says n fellow bikers show the same concern for the land that they demonstrated as hikers many are appalled that the conservation community would suddenly consider them the enemy
to fight back activists such as <unk> <unk> are forming groups <unk> to lobby land managers over access issues and undertake education programs n to show that the bikes can responsibly share trails
<unk> <unk> group <unk> <unk> - <unk> bicyclists <unk> mounted petition drives <unk> to help keep open certain <unk> <unk> <unk> trails designated for closing
biking groups in <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> have won similar concessions says <unk> <unk> <unk> mountain bike editor of <unk> magazine
these groups have been trying to improve the mountain biker image in the <unk> <unk> - area park district where a ranger was clobbered by a cyclist this summer bikers have formed a volunteer patrol <unk> to help rangers enforce regulations and to school riders in proper trail etiquette
even staunch anti - bike <unk> members concede that <unk> of all riders cause most of the problems
while some are renegade riders who simply scorn regulations much bad riding simply reflects ignorance that can be corrected through education and peer pressure says <unk> <unk> a director of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
i think n we making progress
few would have foreseen such a furor when a decade ago some <unk> <unk> bicycle enthusiasts created a hybrid bike using fat tires lightweight metallurgy and multi - gear technology
they wanted a machine that would allow them to pedal into rugged terrain then inaccessible to cycles
they got a machine more responsive more stable and in many ways easier n to ride than the thin - tired racing bikes that then were the rage
when the bikes first entered mass production in n they were dismissed as a fad
last year n of the n million bicycles sold in the <unk> were mountain bikes
in <unk> a bellwether market they accounted for more than <unk> of all bike sales
the majority of the bikes never even make it into the high country
city dwellers love them because they shift smoothly in traffic bounce easily over curbs and roll through road glass with far fewer flat tires than racing bikes
<unk> <unk> population <unk> is a bastion of the sport
by one estimate everyone here under <unk> owns at least one bike

in an apparent attempt to keep a lid on short - term interest rates the <unk> once again pumped money into the banking system

results for the <unk> third quarter and nine months include a pretax loss of n million from the company business improvement and refocusing program and a gain of n million on the sale of a subsidiary common stock
forest - products operations strengthened in the third quarter while paper operations were dogged by higher costs soft newsprint exports and a strong japanese yen
some competing forest - products firms have recently reported improved results due to strong pulp and paper business
<unk> pulp and paper operations were up for the nine months but full - year performance depends on the balance of operating and maintenance costs plus pricing of certain products the company said n
looking ahead to the fourth quarter the company said n export log and lumber markets will be weak while panel and plywood markets will be stronger

<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> became the latest major <unk> bank n to increase reserves for its loans to less - developed countries making a n billion third - quarter addition to its provision

the new reserves bring the company provision for loans to <unk> <unk> countries to <unk> billion or <unk> of bankers <unk> medium and long - term loans to these countries
step up to the plate and take the big swing
get the problem behind you and do n't look back said <unk> <unk> <unk> analyst at <unk> <unk> <unk> in approving of the move
bankers <unk> has had the capacity to do this for some time the analyst said <unk>
he expects <unk> to take a similar step this year
<unk> yesterday reported a <unk> third - quarter earnings drop which analysts called a bit disappointing while manufacturers <unk> <unk> posted a n million loss for the quarter after adding n million to its reserve for loans to less - developed countries
three other major <unk> banks posted earnings increases
<unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> posted a n jump
<unk> <unk> <unk> the parent of <unk> <unk> <unk> reported <unk> net income climbed n while net for <unk> one <unk> of <unk> <unk> grew <unk>

there nothing in here that horrible and nothing n to make you think n they setting the world on fire said <unk> <unk> analyst for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
earnings from the bank global consumer business grew n
the consumer business continues to drive the earnings stream said <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>
corporate finance and trading results in member countries of the <unk> for <unk> <unk> and <unk> were relatively flat sometimes choppy the bank said <unk> and profit for the area sank n
the cross - border loan portfolio reflected adjustment problems and episodic payment patterns the bank said <unk> no interest payments from <unk> in the nine months and none from <unk> in the third quarter while <unk> brought itself substantially current
overall the portfolio narrowed its quarterly loss to n million from n million a year earlier
people were waiting to see if we would take an additional provision for medium - term and long - term loans to less - developed countries a <unk> spokesman said n
but he reiterated the bank position that it is comfortable with the current level of n billion covering about n of the <unk> billion of such loans outstanding
<unk> <unk> <unk> analyst at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> called <unk> venture - capital gains of n million before taxes strong
a concerning item n the analyst cited was the <unk> jump in expenses which the bank attributes to costs of expanding both its consumer credit - card operations and its overseas branch business
<unk> spokesman said however that the bank is maintaining those expenses in proportion to revenue growth
<unk>
<unk> <unk> continued to generate one of the highest profit margins among major banks minimizing a drop in net interest margin with <unk> third - quarter growth in high - yielding business loans and similar growth in mortgages
its margin fell only seven basis points or n of a percentage point from a year ago compared with a n drop at <unk> <unk> <unk> and much larger declines among banks in other parts of the country
as a result <unk> <unk> net interest income rose n million or <unk> to n million for the quarter
<unk> - interest income fell slightly to n million from n million while <unk> <unk> continued to rigorously control non - interest expense which was almost flat at n million
the combination of solid loan growth with tight expense control gave <unk> <unk> a n return on average assets for the quarter about n higher than <unk> <unk> and a profit ratio matched by only two or three other major banks in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> return on equity increased to <unk> from <unk>
<unk> <unk> has sold all of its non - trade loans made to less - developed countries and managed to partly reverse the sharp rise in domestic non - accrual loans which fell n from the previous quarter to n million from n million
but the amount was still <unk> higher than the year - ago level and n higher as a percentage of total loans
that trend and <unk> <unk> heavy exposure to leveraged buy - outs are about the only worries n analysts have about <unk> <unk> financial picture
<unk> <unk> is rebuilding its loan - loss reserve which increased to n million at <unk> n from n million the previous quarter but was down from n million a year ago when the bank still had some shaky foreign loans
manufacturers
manufacturers <unk> said that excluding the addition to its reserves certain tax benefits and a one - time n million gain on the sale of an interest in a foreign leasing company third - quarter earnings were n million
the comparable year - earlier number was n million a spokesman said
the bank additional provisions brought reserves for loans to less - developed countries to n billion covering n of its medium and long - term loans outstanding to these nations
the net interest margin the difference between the bank cost of funds and what it receives as interest payments improved in the quarter as did certain areas of wholesale banking
fees from syndicating loans dropped <unk> to n million
we did n't take part in a lot of deals in the quarter because their credit quality was poor the spokesman said
expenses unrelated to interest rose <unk> to n million
<unk>
<unk> <unk> cited higher income from sources unrelated to interest and said n it continues to cut costs
net interest income in the third quarter edged up <unk> to n million

<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> set a date next month for general elections that some analysts say n could cost him and his ruling <unk> <unk> <unk> control of the government
other analysts say n the indian leader could retain control with a slim majority or be forced to rule as the dominant partner in a coalition with other parties
elections in this large diverse and passionate nation are always hard n to predict
much depends on the opposition a loose group of regional and ideological parties led by former <unk> cabinet minister <unk> <unk> <unk>
the biggest certainty is that the elections will be a vote for or against <unk> <unk> and his five years in power five years of ups and downs promises and disappointments and wide fluctuations in popularity
yesterday four days after an unusual parliamentary defeat for the ruling party <unk> <unk> called elections for the lower house of <unk> on <unk> <unk> and <unk>
the elections will be held in different states on one of the two days
the lower house five - year term expires in <unk> the <unk> upper house is appointed
the elections will be a rigorous test for the n prime minister and <unk> i which in various forms has ruled for <unk> of <unk> <unk> years of independence
after a landslide win in <unk> in polls held after the assassination of his mother <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> saw his popularity begin a roller coaster ride
his early promises to make <unk> a modern nation remain bogged down in bloated bureaucracy
his pledge to clean up local administration and indian politics including his own party went unfulfilled
his <unk> <unk> image was muddied by an arms - kickback scandal which will be a major campaign issue
some analysts predict that disappointment in <unk> <unk> spent pledge to reduce corruption and heavy - handed local government will crest at the polls
there a wide feeling of indignation across the country says <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> for <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
i think n the people will be judging the regime by a petty policeman by a corrupt revenue collector
this could be a big protest against an administrative failure
even if the <unk> i retains control of the government <unk> <unk> ability to push through major initiatives might be hobbled by a thinner majority
economic analysts call his trail - blazing liberalization of the indian economy incomplete and many are hoping for major new liberalizations if he is returned firmly to power
the <unk> <unk> or lower house of <unk> has n elected and two appointed seats
in <unk> the <unk> i captured n seats the largest victory in the history of indian democracy
the landslide was fueled by panic that prevailed in <unk> at the time
<unk> <unk> had been assassinated by separatist sikhs and many indians feared n their country might split apart
in the previous three general elections similar national issues clinched the vote
in <unk> the <unk> <unk> won after <unk> victory in the <unk> war
in <unk> <unk> <unk> was thrown out of office after her n emergency rule and in <unk> after her successors made a mess of their three years in power she was restored to office
most political analysts say that if <unk> <unk> opposition unites to field single candidates in most precincts the <unk> i will lose big
but if the opposition remains fractured the <unk> i could win a small majority or lead a coalition government
<unk> <unk> a parliamentarian and former <unk> ally predicts n <unk> i will win only n seats a quarter of the house if the opposition fields single candidates in n of the races
analysts say n the opposition will struggle this week to unite and its success will be clear only when it announces its final list of parliamentary candidates
the arms - kickback scandal is likely to be one of the big talking points in the campaign but it unclear how it is viewed by average indian voters
in <unk> <unk> signed a n billion contract with <unk> <unk> a unit of <unk> industries <unk> <unk> to purchase n artillery pieces
the contract was negotiated by the countries two prime ministers and was supposed to be free of commissions or agents costs
in <unk> n evidence surfaced that commissions were paid
the opposition charged that the money was used to bribe indian government officials an allegation denied by <unk> <unk> administration
but many of his statements on the issue in <unk> subsequently were proven wrong by documentary evidence
the scandal has faded and flared but recent disclosures propelled it back onto the front pages and that has helped galvanize the opposition which last week blocked passage of two constitutional amendment bills
it was the first time in n years that such government bills were defeated
in a country where a bribe is needed to get a phone a job and even into a school the name <unk> has become a potent rallying cry against the government
that illustrates the kind of disappointment n many indians feel toward <unk> <unk> whom they zestfully elected and enthusiastically supported in his first two years in power
his term has produced no spectacular failures in politics in the economy or on the military front and has chalked up some successes
but the average <unk> had tremendous hope in the youthful leader and his promise to make both government and the ruling party more effective and less corrupt
his failures in those two areas deeply and sometimes bitterly disappointed many indians
we do n't like the <unk> i says <unk> <unk> a farmer in the western state of <unk>
the <unk> government is taking the farmers bread and not giving us any support
when there are well problems light problems road problems the government tells us to forget it
the greatest thing going for <unk> <unk> and the <unk> i <unk> is the poor reputation of the opposition
even if it unites for the elections its coherence is likely to be temporary
when the <unk> i lost the <unk> election following <unk> <unk> hated emergency rule a similar coalition took power and then disintegrated
many indians fear a repeat of that experience

a <unk> - <unk> conference approved an estimated n billion fiscal n spending bill that provides a <unk> increase for space research and development and incorporates far - reaching provisions affecting the federal mortgage market
the current ceiling on home loans insured by the <unk> <unk> <unk> would be increased to n
separately the bill gives authority to the <unk> administration to facilitate the refinancing of federally subsidized loans for low - income and moderate - income homeowners
the second provision affecting so - called n mortgages has met strong opposition from investment bankers represented by the <unk> securities <unk>
and a squad of influential former <unk> aides employed by the <unk> <unk> firm <unk> brothers came to the <unk> in a vain attempt to strip the provision
by an <unk> margin <unk> negotiators voted to preserve the n mortgage refinancing plan and despite powerful allies the opposition found itself undercut by an unusual alliance of liberals and conservatives
the government currently is subsidizing an estimated n loans above n under the <unk> program and however disruptive to private investors the refinancing is expected to yield at least n million in savings in fiscal <unk>
this sum has been guarded jealously by appropriators anxious to offset spending elsewhere and conservative <unk> <unk> <unk> cast the fight as a populist stand against monied interests
we are stewards here not of the mortgage companies but the taxpayers said the <unk> <unk>
the action came as the administration won final congressional approval of n million in assistance for elections scheduled in <unk> in <unk>
the bulk of the money would be funneled through the <unk> <unk> for <unk> but the legislation is so vaguely written that it has been dogged by questions regarding the money true purpose and its ultimate destination
the <unk> had refused late <unk> to invoke cloture and limit debate but behind the bipartisan leadership a solid majority took shape yesterday and brushed aside amendments seeking to cut the total package or steer it away from direct aid to political parties
final approval on a n roll call was never in doubt but the opposition drew an unusual mix of senators including republicans <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and democrats <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
the money will be applied for voter registration and election monitoring but more than half is likely to go to the <unk> <unk> <unk> party
critics warned <unk> such cash contributions may only undercut the opposition party standing and one irony is that under nicaraguan law a major portion of the opposition party funds must be shared with the government <unk> <unk> <unk>
within the appropriations conference yesterday the n billion measure is the second largest of the annual domestic spending bills and covers a disparate collection of accounts for science housing veterans and the environment
the decision to raise the ceiling on <unk> home loans still faces strong opposition in the <unk>
but it is driven by the same fiscal pressures that have forced lawmakers to resort to various bookkeeping devices to juggle as much as <unk> billion in spending that would otherwise put the bill over budget
these costs will complicate the budget picture in fiscal <unk> and the measure further commits <unk> to a set of costly projects including the first construction funds for the space station
the station is promised n billion within the n billion provided for research and development in the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and the nation high - speed aerospace plane cut by the <unk> could receive as much as n million in new funds or transfers
similarly the <unk> agreed to add back n million to continue work on the advanced communications technology satellite being developed by <unk> <unk> <unk>
and while setting a statutory limit of n billion on the automated space probe the conference appropriated n million for the start - up of the <unk> - <unk> mission a successor to the <unk> space probe
among major domestic agencies the <unk> <unk> <unk> stands to receive increases significantly beyond those sought by the administration with pollution abatement and control accounts growing by <unk> to about n million
an estimated n billion is separately allocated for the <unk> <unk> <unk> and within the <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> more than <unk> billion is provided for federally assisted housing including an expanded effort to modernize public housing units that serve the poorest families
to an unusual degree the massive bill has become a vehicle n for lawmakers to earmark funds for projects in home states
while the practice was discouraged in the past the conference agreement is laced with veterans hospitals environmental projects and urban grants designated for specific communities
the most striking example yesterday may have been in community development funds where the two houses had separately approved a total of n projects valued at n million and the conference added <unk> more valued at n million to ostensibly preserve balance between the <unk> and <unk>
yesterday conference agreement is the second major bill <unk> to emerge from negotiations this week as appropriators approved a fiscal n transportation bill late <unk> that includes a sweeping ban on smoking on most domestic airline flights
an exemption will remain for flights longer than six hours to <unk> and <unk> but estimates by the tobacco industry yesterday indicate n all but about <unk> flights would be covered
separately a third conference report covering an n billion <unk> and <unk> <unk> bill was sent to the <unk> after passing the <unk> on a n roll call yesterday
and after weeks of delay the appropriations process is beginning to take some final shape
defense and foreign aid are the two most critical areas remaining from the administration standpoint
and among domestic programs the most serious threat is <unk> <unk> opposition to abortion riders attached to separate bills funding the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> of <unk> and <unk> services
the same issue threatens to spill over to the foreign aid debate and <unk> <unk> also is threatening to veto any agreement that preserves <unk> - passed provisions renewing <unk> support for the <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> activities
in a sharply written letter <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman of the <unk> appropriations subcommittee for foreign operations warned <unk> <unk> that the result of his ultimatum could weaken efforts to accommodate the administration elsewhere
as a result of your ultimatum writes the <unk> <unk> i guess n there is no longer any point in taking administration views into account on other items in conference inasmuch regardless of their resolution you apparently intend to veto this bill
markets usually get noticed because they soar or plunge
gold which has n't risen or fallen significantly in quite some time yesterday achieved what may be a new level of impassiveness the most actively traded futures contracts closed unchanged despite nervous fluctuations in both the dollar and the stock market
the settlement prices of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> gold contracts were even with <unk> final prices
the <unk> n contract which has the greatest trading volume ended at n an ounce
the other months posted advances of n cents to n cents an ounce
according to one analyst <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> the stock market ability on <unk> to rally from last <unk> decline which seemed to indicate that the economy was n't going to fall either took the starch out of precious metals prices and out of gold in particular
yesterday gold traded within a narrow range
gold tried to rally on <unk> but ran into the same situation that has subdued gold prices for more than a year selling by gold producers who want to fix the highest possible price for their gold
<unk> delivery gold is trading in a range of <unk> to n an ounce and is having difficulty breaking out above that <unk> <unk> said
producers at the moment regard that area a good one in which to sell gold
also <unk> <unk> noted stock market investors seeking greater safety are veering toward buying bonds rather than precious metals because we are tending more toward a disinflationary economy that does n't make gold and precious metals attractive
<unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> <unk> precious metals advisers said n there is little n to motivate gold traders to buy the metal
investors in the <unk> and <unk> are comfortable with the actions of the <unk> <unk> in its willingness to supply liquidity to financial system which helped the stock market rebound on <unk> he said
there is n't any rush on the part of investors in the <unk> to buy gold he said n
they still bear the memory of <unk> n when they bought gold after the stock market crashed and ended up losing money because gold prices subsequently fell <unk> <unk> said
it an experience n they do n't want to repeat
at the moment gold traders are n't concerned about inflation he said and as for the dollar gold association with the currency has been diminishing recently so drops in the currency are n't having much impact on gold
<unk> <unk> chief bullion trader for <unk> <unk> <unk> said there is little incentive on the part of traders n to sell gold because the stock market may go lower and gold may retain some of its flight to safety quality
there is little incentive n to buy gold because if the stock market goes higher it may be just a false alarm
this is keeping the gold traders handcuffed
the most remarkable feature about yesterday action was that the price of roughly n an ounce was regarded as attractive enough by gold producers around the world to aggressively sell gold <unk> <unk> said
i do n't know what it means over the long run but for the short term it appears that gold producers are grateful for the n or so that gold has risen over the past week or so he said
previously he noted gold producers tended to back off from a rising gold market letting prices rise as much as possible before selling
<unk> <unk> observed that the <unk> merchandise trade deficit which rose sharply in <unk> according to yesterday report has been having less and less impact on the gold market
the dollar has n't reacted much to it so gold has n't either he said

<unk> is perceived as a wealthy nation that can turn elsewhere in the world market and buy the sugar the analyst said
it was the possibility of this demand that helped firm prices the analyst said
another analyst noted that <unk> has been deferring shipments in recent years
to the professionals in the trade it did n't cause much surprise
the <unk> futures contract traded as high as n cents but could n't sustain the advance he said

the prices of cattle hogs and pork belly futures contracts rebounded as livestock traders shook off fears that the <unk> stock market plunge would chill consumer spending which in turn would hurt retail sales of beef and pork
the prices of most livestock futures contracts had dropped sharply <unk>
cattle futures prices were also supported yesterday by signs that supermarket chains are making plans to increase their promotions concerning beef
grains and soybeans
the prices of most soybean and soybean - meal futures contracts rose amid rumors that the <unk> <unk> is interested in buying from the <unk> or <unk> <unk> about <unk> metric tons of soybeans and as many as <unk> metric tons of soybean meal

when the soviets announced <unk> their last soldier had left <unk> in <unk> the voices of skepticism were all but drowned out by an international chorus of euphoria
it was the soviets <unk>
the <unk> regime would fall
millions of refugees would rush home
a resistance government would walk into <unk>
those who bought that illusion are now bewildered
eight months after <unk> <unk> <unk> walked across the bridge into the <unk> a <unk> - controlled regime remains in <unk> the refugees sit in their camps and the restoration of afghan freedom seems as far off as ever
but there never was a chance that the afghan resistance would overthrow the <unk> regime quickly and easily
soviet leaders said n they would support their <unk> clients by all means necessary and did
the <unk> said n it would fully support the resistance and did n't
with the <unk> n <unk> accords relating to <unk> the <unk> <unk> got everything n it needed to consolidate permanent control
the terms of the <unk> accords leave <unk> free to provide its clients in <unk> with assistance of any kind including the return of soviet ground forces while requiring the <unk> and <unk> to cut off aid
the only fly in the soviet ointment was the last - minute addition of a unilateral american caveat that <unk> aid to the resistance would continue as long as soviet aid to <unk> did
but as soon as the accords were signed american officials sharply reduced aid
in <unk> n when the soviets said n they had completed their pullout the <unk> cut it further
not so the soviets
<unk> <unk> himself said <unk> soviet troops expected to leave behind more than <unk> billion of military equipment and installations for the <unk> regime
since the troop withdrawal <unk> has poured in an additional n to n million worth per month nearly n billion since <unk> equivalent to the total <unk> aid to the resistance in nine years
this includes what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> fetchingly called new peaceful long - range weapons including more than <unk> <unk> missiles
by early <unk> <unk> had delivered for example n trucks about n tanks artillery and hundreds of other combat vehicles
later that month it added an entire tank brigade including <unk> <unk> tanks and more than n <unk> state - of-the-art infantry fighting vehicles
by <unk> a new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with an additional <unk> combat vehicles n more trucks and <unk> <unk> - trained afghan troops had arrived in <unk>
in the last few weeks <unk> has added <unk> missiles the bomber version of the <unk> <unk> high - altitude aircraft n which can outfly <unk> <unk> n and <unk> <unk> fighter - bombers which can outfly the n
<unk> claims n this is all needed to protect the <unk> regime against the guerrilla resistance
it is well - known that the regular afghan infantry is filled with reluctant conscripts
but this is not the entire afghan army and it is no longer <unk> only military force
complete units have been trained and indoctrinated in the <unk> and other <unk> <unk> nations <unk> to n of these troops have returned
in addition the regime has established well - paid paramilitary forces totaling more than <unk> including <unk> <unk> - trained troops of the <unk> <unk> <unk> which still is directed by <unk> <unk> <unk> officers
even if not all these forces are committed to the regime they are now dependent on it
and thousands of afghan children have been taken to the <unk> <unk> where they are hostage for the behavior of their families
since <unk> indian military advisers have been assisting the <unk> regime
in preparation for the withdrawal <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> signed two agreements n for several hundred newly civilian indian experts to replace some of the more visible soviet military personnel
cuban military personnel also have been active in <unk> since <unk>
the soviets cut a deal with <unk> a future iranian role in <unk> in exchange for iranian support of soviet policy
the deal was symbolized by the restoration of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the afghan prime ministry
moreover serious questions have been raised about the claimed withdrawal of soviet forces
before his assassination in <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> repeatedly stated that fresh soviet troops were being inserted into <unk> even as others were ostentatiously withdrawn
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> reports that these included n to <unk> <unk> central asian <unk> <unk> guards ethnically indistinguishable from afghans and wearing unmarked uniforms
meanwhile the <unk> regime is increasingly successful at portraying the resistance as bloody - minded fanatics
in this they are aided by years of american european <unk> and saudi support for the most extreme factions radical islamic fanatics with leaders whose policies are anathema to the afghan public
this heavy outside support for the worst has undermined better moderate leaders
in autumn last year for example the regime garrison at <unk> was prepared to surrender the city to resistance moderates
at the last minute however pakistani officials sent in <unk> <unk> perhaps the most hated and feared of the extremists with a demand that the surrender be made to his forces
the deal fell through and <unk> remains a major regime base
the resistance lacks not only air power armor and expertise but often such essentials as maps mine detectors or even winter gloves
experienced resistance commanders wanted to use guerrilla action and siege tactics to wear down the regime
instead they were pressured by <unk> <unk> the channel for their support into attacking <unk>
they took more than <unk> casualties journalists report that they faced minefields without mine detectors
the wonder is not that the resistance has failed to topple the <unk> regime but that it continues to exist and fight at all
last summer in response to congressional criticism the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> said <unk> they had resumed military aid to the resistance months after it was cut off but it is not clear how much is being sent or when it will arrive
for months the resistance has been defenseless against air attack
thus far there is no indication that they have been re - supplied with stingers or other anti - aircraft weapons
indeed <unk> officials have indicated to the press that the continuation of aid depends on what success the weakened resistance achieves by the end of this year
<unk> and <unk> must have found that information useful
for a decade <unk> policy has been incoherent based on miscalculation and the defense of bureaucratic and political turf
no settlement negotiated by others can force the afghan people to give up their struggle
a cutoff of <unk> military aid would merely abandon them to die in vain
creation of a new realistic <unk> policy is long overdue
<unk> <unk> editor and co - author of <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> directs the <unk> <unk> program on <unk> <unk>
nothing stirred the soul of <unk> <unk> and his disciples as much as the crusade to aid <unk> <unk> rebels or the dream of building a space - based defense shield to knock out soviet nuclear missiles
yet under <unk> <unk> preferred successor <unk> <unk> those two cherished national - security causes are withering on the vine
and surprisingly little more than a whimper of protest is being heard even though reaganauts once breathed fire supporting the contras and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
the programs have arthritis says <unk> <unk> <unk> a conservative <unk> from <unk>
yet he asserts you look around and you say who are the leaders
who is going to carry the water
it is n't surprising that <unk> <unk> has n't led a crusade to pump up the contras or <unk>
though he nominally supports both programs <unk> <unk> has n't been a passionate champion of either cause as <unk> <unk> was
what surprising is that there is n't more of a conservative outcry as the <unk> administration lets the programs slip down the national - priority list
a combination of factors a weariness among some conservatives a decline in the perception of a soviet threat and a preoccupation with other issues seem to explain the strange tranquility
above all though conservative republicans who have championed both the contras and <unk> are reluctant to attack a republican president for failing to do more though that reluctance may be receding
we want to complain we want to say something about it and we going to as it gets worse says <unk> <unk> <unk> an <unk> <unk> who has been a staunch <unk> backer
but it like kicking your father in the pants
you hate to do it because he your father
<unk> <unk> says <unk> conservatives unhappiness with <unk> <unk> cautious handling of the recent unsuccessful coup in <unk> will make them more willing to speak out
of course neither <unk> <unk> nor the <unk> has actually abandoned the contras or <unk>
<unk> <unk> has struck a deal with congressional leaders to provide nonlethal aid to the <unk> until <unk> holds national elections next <unk>
but the administration has dropped any effort to win military aid for the rebels
and the administration deal with <unk> gives several congressional committees the right to cut off even humanitarian aid next month though the committees are likely to let aid continue until <unk>
most analysts think n there little prospect <unk> the contras can be a significant fighting force without <unk> arms and after the <unk> election their future in any form will be murky at best
instead of focusing on the contras <unk> <unk> has switched to urging members of <unk> most recently in a <unk> <unk> meeting yesterday to approve financing for the election campaign of political opponents of <unk> <unk> government
the administration continues to support <unk> or <unk> wars and it recently lobbied to persuade the <unk> to restore some of the funds n it planned to cut from the program
and just last week <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> gave a strong speech listing compelling reasons n to push ahead with <unk> and saying n he urge <unk> <unk> to veto a defense bill with inadequate funding for the program
but the strong pitch by <unk> <unk> may be too little too late n to prevent damage to <unk>
the <unk> has already voted for a deep cut in funding and in the end the program backers will be hard pressed to head off some reduction in spending next year
and while the defense secretary is speaking out <unk> <unk> himself has n't launched any high - visibility campaign to drum up support as <unk> <unk> did
the administration also acknowledges that it is n't pursuing <unk> <unk> original vision of an impenetrable shield protecting the whole <unk> but rather a more modest version
more ominous to <unk> supporters the <unk> administration appears to have tacitly accepted a new arms - control proposal from the <unk> <unk> that spells long - term trouble for <unk> wars
the soviets have agreed to complete a treaty cutting strategic weapons without including restrictions on space - based defenses
but the soviets also are insisting that they will reserve the right to withdraw from the completed strategic - arms treaty later on if the <unk> does <unk> testing or deployment that the soviets think n violates the existing anti - ballistic-missile treaty
it will be hard down the road to persuade <unk> to approve money for <unk> plans if lawmakers fear n those plans could scuttle a completed treaty
as a result <unk> <unk> a former <unk> <unk> aide who now heads the <unk> for <unk> <unk> charges that the administration professions of continued commitment to development and deployment of the <unk> program strain credulity
still proponents may be shying away from more drumbeating because they sense n political tides have turned against arming the nicaraguan rebels or boosting spending on <unk> particularly when the public perceives n the soviet threat is declining under <unk> <unk>
in fact because communism seems to be beating a global retreat some conservatives may simply be so pleased that their anti - communist philosophy is prevailing that they do n't have the fire at the moment to push controversial programs
the short of it is that the most hard - bitten among us can not get into too sour a mood with communism collapsing says <unk> <unk> a former <unk> <unk> <unk> aide who now is president of the <unk> <unk>
some activists are toiling to raise the profile of the two causes
but they say n they ca n't make much headway because of a lack of willing leaders in a position n to turn the tide
one longtime champion of these programs in <unk> <unk> whip <unk> <unk> of <unk> is distracted by questions about his ethics conservatives note n
other conservative champions like <unk> republican <unk> <unk> <unk> a longtime <unk> advocate do n't have the clout with the <unk> <unk> <unk> that they enjoyed with <unk> <unk>
above all though proponents say n neither the <unk> nor the <unk> cause can be pushed much further without more presidential support
for there to be wind in the sails of any program the chief executive has to be blowing in the sails says <unk> <unk>
all this causes <unk> <unk> to muse about an alternate way n to drum up more enthusiasm
what i like to see if he is up to it is for <unk> to take to the hustings to regenerate enthusiasm for <unk> the congressman says
we sorry to report that on <unk> <unk> <unk> accepted the resignation of <unk> <unk> as chairman of the <unk> <unk> rights <unk>
<unk> <unk> appointed by <unk> <unk> grew understandably tired of dealing with the guerrilla tactics of his enemies
his recent speech provocatively titled <unk> animals homosexuals what is a minority caused an uproar when its title leaked out
<unk> <unk> commissioners voted to call his unread speech thoughtless disgusting and unnecessarily inflammatory
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> it was another sad episode in the saga of the unguided missile who is chairman
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> warned <unk> <unk> that the speech would be outside the scope of the commission jurisdiction
<unk> <unk> head of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> called the prospect of the speech frankly shocking
we actually read the speech
<unk> <unk> began it with a warning to his hosts a <unk> church group that opposes rights for homosexuals
he said that other participants in the conference do not believe that the rights of americans should be guaranteed to citizens who are homosexual but that i mean to persuade you to the opposite view
he recalled to the audience a strange infelicitous analogy n he once heard arguing n now that we have finally recognized that american blacks have rights we need to do the same for animals
<unk> <unk> objected to this analogy because it seems to assimilate the status of blacks to that of animals as a mere project of charity of humaneness
rights on such a basis whether for blacks or homosexuals are mere indulgences he said n subject to being taken back
he says n the title of his speech was to make his point that americans have rights as individuals not as members of certain select groups
his speech criticized the idiocy of notions of protected groups in society as opposed to individual equality or as he put it in a common destiny as americans
instead of lobbying for special treatment <unk> <unk> said that homosexuals and others should try to ensure equal treatment under the law and not aim for special privileges that would risk invidious retrenchment with government complicity
this hardly sounds like an anti - homosexual screed
what really going on here
the three most important things n to understand about <unk> <unk> is that he is a black conservative intellectual a triple threat to the liberal establishment
<unk> <unk> who teaches government at prestigious <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and will remain a member of the commission has spent years arguing that civil rights are individuals rights
he last made waves when he dared to defend an indian girl who had been adopted by non - indian parents off her reservation
<unk> <unk> quickly ran up against the liberal establishment again which somehow elevated the vague concept of indian rights above the rights of individual indians
there is a huge divide between <unk> <unk> we're - all-in-this-together view and the divisive litigation approach of the civil rights groups
indeed the gap is so large that <unk> <unk> critics refuse to engage the debate
their ridicule of him is no substitute for argument
their effort to run him out of <unk> is an embarrassment to the original purpose of their own movement
we hope <unk> the next head of the <unk> rights <unk> will be as brave as <unk> <unk> in making the case for equality of civil rights
<unk> <unk> said <unk> its chairman <unk> <unk> <unk> will retire as an officer of the company on <unk> n
<unk> <unk> <unk> president and chief executive officer will become chairman and chief executive upon <unk> <unk> retirement
<unk> <unk> <unk> executive vice president and chief operating officer will become president and chief operating officer
<unk> <unk> <unk> years old was chief executive of the distributor of bearings and power - transmission products from <unk> to n
he will continue as a director
<unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> veteran at <unk> has been president since <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> joined <unk> in <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk> where he was president and chief operating officer
he has been a <unk> director since <unk>
the appointments are part of a planned succession at the company
soviet leader <unk> <unk> opened a major <unk> trade exhibition in <unk> and spent two hours touring some of the <unk> stalls representing such blue - chip companies as <unk> motors <unk> <unk> <unk> machines <unk> and <unk> <unk>

a <unk> executive in charge of exports when the high - purity halogenated hydrocarbon was sold to the soviets in <unk> received a suspended n jail sentence
<unk> <unk> <unk> told the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> responsibility is heavy because illegal exports lowered international trust in <unk>
sale of the solution in concentrated form to communist countries is prohibited by japanese law and by international agreement
a soviet legislative panel rejected as not radical enough a government proposal on decentralizing economic control
the newspaper <unk> <unk> said <unk> the committee decided n the plan to parcel out economic powers previously exercised by <unk> to the country n republics does n't reflect the radical changes in the soviet federation
the committee gave the government until <unk> n to revise the proposal
the move reflected the growing confidence of the revamped <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> it is abandoning a proposed n million tree - farming project in <unk> because it no longer expects to use as much eucalyptus pulp as previously anticipated
the eucalyptus plantation and pulp mill which would have covered about <unk> acres in the <unk> <unk> region had been approved by <unk> investment board
but it was opposed by some environmentalists as a threat to <unk> <unk> forests and a potential source of social unrest for the primitive tribes who inhabit them

then there be fair competition

<unk> <unk> representative and delegation head <unk> <unk> called the first meeting good interesting and businesslike
<unk> <unk> benefiting from staff - reduction savings reported a strong gain in third - quarter operating results and net income of n million or n cents a share after preferred - stock requirements
analysts said <unk> the numbers were better than expectations partly because of strong profit margins and a positive foreign - currency translation
however they said n the company flat revenue was a disappointment and an indication that sales of <unk> new conventional film in the <unk> have been sluggish
revenue in the third quarter was n million almost unchanged from n million a year earlier
<unk> reported operating profit before taxes and interest costs of n million for the third quarter more than double the year - before n million
charges for staff cuts and other restructuring produced a net loss of n million or n cents a share in <unk> third quarter
i somewhat skeptical about the underlying demand for <unk> products said <unk> <unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk> <unk>
if you believe that a good performance next year is contingent on an acceleration of revenue there is n't a lot here n to base optimism on
<unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> - <unk> says <unk> <unk> officials told him yesterday that <unk> sales of the company new conventional film product introduced in the second quarter have been disappointing after a promising start
<unk> <unk> a <unk> spokesman said n i do n't know about disappointing but added that the company has n't been able to get the product on the shelves of some mass - merchandise discount retailers that it had hoped n would be carrying the product already
<unk> <unk> said <unk> the film one <unk> is currently carried at about n retail outlets including drugstores and supermarkets
for the nine months <unk> reported earnings of n million or <unk> a share
last year the company had a nine - month loss of n million or n cents a share
in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> composite trading <unk> closed at <unk> up <unk>
why is the stock market suddenly so volatile
yesterday the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> did a now familiar dance it plunged <unk> points before lunch with most of the drop occurring in <unk> minutes
then it rebounded to finish down only n points
and those swings paled beside <unk> <unk> plunge and <unk> <unk> recovery
it madness that in an hour you can whack off so much value says <unk> <unk> chairman of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
and apparently it is here to stay
<unk> <unk> senior quantitative analyst at <unk> <unk> <unk> says <unk> my gut feel is that we live with those swings for a while
there are many reasons for the market jumpiness new trading vehicles such as stock - index futures and options computer - driven strategies like program trading and crowd psychology
but most are linked by a single theme liquidity the ability to get in and out of the market quickly
prices are moving up and down so fast because investors are employing ways n to turn over shares at ever - faster rates and increasingly acting in concert
institutions are herding animals says <unk> <unk> who heads the pension - fund management arm of <unk> <unk> services <unk>
we watch the same indicators and listen to the same prognosticators
like lemmings we tend to move in the same direction at same time
and that naturally exacerbates price movements
institutions who now account for most trading count on being able to buy and sell big blocks of stock at an eye - blink
but when they discover that markets are n't always as liquid as they supposed markets jump
on <unk> for instance <unk> <unk> a principal at <unk> <unk> <unk> found that you could n't buy blue - chips at quoted prices without paying up
and when many firms had to pay up <unk> sudden rally was sparked
trading in futures and options some people believe n can add to volatility
investors believe n they can can rely on such derivative securities to get in and out of the stock market without actually selling any stocks that is a way of staying liquid even when they own stocks
these and other modern trading methods tend to promote dramatic shifts in assets says <unk> <unk> <unk> first vice president at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
it the idea that what goes in easy can come out easy so that bouts of higher volatility get built into the stock market
one new investment style called asset allocation shifts portfolio weightings between stocks bonds and cash when computer models say <unk> one is more attractive
for instance <unk> <unk> <unk> an asset allocator based in <unk> <unk> said n it quickly boosted stock positions in its aggressive accounts to n from <unk> to take advantage of plunging prices <unk>
it added another <unk> <unk> before stocks rallied
when they did the firm reduced those stock holdings to about <unk>
a classic example of institutions hunger for liquidity is portfolio insurance now widely discredited
before the <unk> crash an estimated n billion in institutional money was managed under this hedging technique
the idea was to insure the value of a portfolio by selling futures when stock prices dropped eliminating the need to sell the stocks themselves
but in <unk> n when portfolio insurers rushed to sell at the same time they overwhelmed both the stock and futures markets
yet even today institutions are quietly practicing forms of portfolio insurance by nervously rushing to and fro in the markets
others are doing index arbitrage a strategy of taking advantage of price discrepancies between stocks and futures
unlike traditional buy - and-hold strategies all of the above require that market makers be on hand to provide liquidity by buying and selling stocks in a crunch
but institutions say n <unk> <unk> brokerage firms are less willing to make markets
brokers do n't deny that
<unk> <unk> traders say that with institutional brokerage commissions far lower than in the <unk> securities firms ca n't afford to take the risk of buying too much stock
i think n everyone a little more leery says <unk> <unk> head of equity trading at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the institutions have driven commission rates down to the point where it makes no sense to commit capital says <unk> <unk> senior executive vice president in charge of institutional trading at <unk> <unk>
why should i risk money for a guy for who paying me five cents a dance
all n you get is risk
lack of liquidity can also result from exchange reforms
many traders say that circuit breakers put in place to damp volatility after the <unk> crash actually added to volatility when the stock market plunged <unk>
the circuit breakers caused a n shutdown in trading in <unk> <unk> <unk> index futures contract as the markets were falling
with the futures - trading halt you could only sell stocks to cut exposure to the market says <unk> a money manager
it was scary to people thinking that they could n't get their trades off
it was like they put you in a room with a gorilla and told you n there were three doors n to exit said one <unk> - based futures trader
then they said <unk> by the way two of the doors are locked
the takeover mania also adds to volatility
<unk> <unk> is a good example
valued as a buy - out target the airline stock was trading at nearly n a share
when the deal ran into trouble the stock tumbled it closed at <unk> yesterday
presumably <unk> is now trading closer to its value based on earnings
by contrast traditional buy - and-hold investors are unlikely to generate sudden price moves
<unk> <unk> a value - oriented money manager who heads <unk> <unk> <unk> points out that for those who invest on fundamentals the value of a stock from day to day does n't change all that much
some experts say n markets are n't as volatile as widely assumed
<unk> <unk> finance professor at <unk> <unk> says <unk> the current volatility in <unk> markets pales in comparison to the <unk> decades before derivative instruments such as options and futures were introduced
i just ca n't believe that the innovations in the financial market are causing any of this volatility he says
and <unk> <unk> <unk> president of asset allocator <unk> <unk> notes that before <unk> tailspin daily volatility on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in recent weeks had reached historically low levels
some people tend to ignore that a <unk> move is less in percentage terms than it was when the stock market was lower
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman of the <unk> <unk> asserts that <unk> and n have been two of the least volatile years in the last <unk> or n years
but the low average volatility <unk> <unk> <unk> is talking about is n't any comfort in a period of rapid stock - market moves like the past week
in addition <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> finance professor says <unk> volatile jumps in stock prices will continue as long as liquidity falls short of the voracious demands of institutions who can go out and say i have a billion dollars of stocks n to sell
some people think n the search for liquidity is fruitless
in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> wrote that of the maxims of orthodox finance none surely is more antisocial than the fetish of liquidity
it leads investors to focus on short - term price movements a game of musical chairs he called it rather than on long - term fundamental valuation
<unk> <unk> <unk> contributed to this article
the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> said <unk> a computer virus has infected one of its networks and is spreading anti - nuclear messages related to its <unk> space probe which is to be launched today
<unk> <unk> a <unk> spokesman said <unk> the agency discovered the virus on <unk> on the collection of computer networks collectively called internet and expected n university centers to be infected by today
although the network is n't connected to the computer systems that operate either <unk> or the shuttle part of the network will carry analyses of <unk> data once the craft gets spaceborn
<unk> <unk> said <unk> the intruder had n't yet done any harm but the agency feared <unk> garbage data could be substituted for real data
he estimated n it could take a day for a computer security manager to expunge the virus from a computer system
the intruder among the broadest yet n to hit a research network appeared to affect only <unk> <unk> <unk> hardware that uses <unk> <unk> operating system
it is unrelated to the much - publicized virus that last year infected <unk> a much larger network used by researchers at universities laboratories and government agencies around the world
in the lingo of computer security the <unk> intruder is technically a computer worm <unk> <unk> said n
a worm resides in the operating system of a computer and spreads by boring into other computers contacted through networks
the <unk> worm apparently was hatched on a computer in <unk> hooked up to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said n
<unk> said <unk> the <unk> worm had n't affected its computers or the computers of other government agencies because they had modified their systems to reject worms
but <unk> <unk> said <unk> the worm hit universities that had n't elected to make the changes
<unk> <unk> a senior editor at <unk> a trade publication said <unk> he was told that the worm gets into a computer center by looking for obvious passwords such as ones that are the same as the user name
if it finds one and gets into the system it will display a screen when a user logs on that says worms <unk> <unk> killers
you talk of times of peace for all and then prepare for war
in addition <unk> <unk> said <unk> the worm sends strange messages to other machines at the center such as <unk> <unk> was an optimist or do n't feed the bats tonight
the worm also looks for elementary passwords that confer more privileges on the user
the passwords are included in the system software when it is installed but are supposed to be replaced as soon as the system is up and running
if it finds one of those passwords <unk> <unk> said <unk> the worm will do such things as change users passwords to a series of random numbers preventing them from signing on to the network
<unk> estimated that on <unk> about four computer centers were affected
yesterday the number grew to <unk> today the number is expected to grow to n
<unk> said n it will take about a week before it knows exactly how many centers of the <unk> connected to <unk> were affected and the extent of the damage if any
<unk> - nuclear activists have protested the launch of the <unk> space probe to <unk> because it uses plutonium to generate the electricity needed to run the craft
activists fear that if the shuttle carrying <unk> into orbit should explode or if <unk> itself crashes into the earth during the two times n it flies close to the planet fatal levels of plutonium would be released into the atmosphere
so far <unk> has been delayed twice once because of a computer malfunction connected with a space - shuttle engine and yesterday because of the weather
<unk> said <unk> the <unk> worm had nothing n to do with either delay
<unk> <unk> of <unk> said n hackers have gone after <unk> before
he said <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> once managed to invade <unk> and do such things as n change the value of pi messing up some calculations
it is now a commonplace that prosecutors are bringing criminal indictments in cases where until a few years ago only a civil action at most would have been brought
yet it is also axiomatic that the power to create new crimes belongs only to the legislature and not to courts
beginning in the early n century with <unk> v. <unk> and <unk> the <unk> <unk> has repeatedly held that a judicial power to declare conduct to be against the public interest and hence criminal while well established in british law would usurp legislative authority under the doctrine of separation of powers
that the conventional theory anyway
in practice however the line between interpretation and redefinition of the criminal law long ago began to blur
in particular a common law of white - collar crime has developed with surprising rapidity over the past decade
for example although insider trading has long been criminal it has never been statutorily defined
in <unk> the <unk> <unk> tried to supply a workable definition in the dirks v. <unk> decision which found that liability depended on whether the tipper had breached his fiduciary duty to the corporation in order to obtain some personal gain and whether the tippee knew or recklessly disregarded this fact
gradually however lower courts and prosecutors have pushed this definition to its breaking point
consider the facts underlying the n conviction of <unk> <unk>
prior to a tender offer by <unk> for <unk> <unk> in <unk> the founder of the <unk> supermarket chain called an elderly relative to tell her to assemble her stock certificates for delivery
she called her daughter to take her to the bank who in turn persuaded her husband a <unk> <unk> to run this errand
hearing of this information the husband discussed it with his broker <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> then bought for his own account and other clients
basically <unk> <unk> was a fourth - level tippee
did <unk> <unk> his tipper breach a fiduciary duty and if so to whom
did <unk> <unk> seek personal gain and if so how
or did <unk> <unk> only hear a market rumor which one may lawfully trade upon
the line seems awfully thin for criminal - law purposes
a second illustration is supplied by the recent guilty plea entered by <unk> <unk> formerly head of arbitrage at <unk> <unk> <unk>
essentially <unk> <unk> had invested heavily in the <unk> leveraged buy - out when he was told by another prominent trader <unk> <unk> <unk> that the deal was in trouble
after placing orders to sell <unk> <unk> called <unk> <unk> an investment banker at <unk> <unk> <unk> who was advising on the deal to confirm these rumors
<unk> <unk> asked <unk> <unk> who his source was and on hearing that it was <unk> <unk> responded <unk> well your bunny has a good nose
the illegal tip of the bunny good nose was then largely a confirmation of rumors already known to many in the market
had the case gone to trial the same issues would have surfaced
was there a fiduciary breach in order to obtain personal gain
did <unk> <unk> have notice of this
finally was the information material
yet all these issues are subsidiary to a more central issue who is and who should be making the criminal law here
it is not my contention that either <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> was an innocent victim of prosecutorial overzealousness
arguably both were on notice that their behavior was at least risky
but even if they behaved recklessly reasons still exist to fear and resist this steady process of case - by-case judicial extension of the law of insider trading
courts and legislatures make decisions in very different ways and are each susceptible to very different kinds of errors
after - the-fact judicial examination of an actor conduct has always been the common law method
when only civil liability is involved this method has the undeniable strengths of factual specificity and avoidance of overgeneralization
still case - by-case retrospective decision making of this sort is vulnerable to the tunnel vision caused by a fixation on ad hoc and usually sleazy examples
when a court decides that a particular actor conduct was culpable and so extends the definition of insider trading to reach this conduct it does not see the potentially enormous number of other cases that will be covered by the expanded rule
thus a court is poorly positioned to make judgments about the social utility of the expanded rule
for example in focusing on <unk> <unk> attempt to gain nonpublic information about a deal collapse one does not naturally think about the reverse side of the coin what if the rumor had been false
can a security analyst call an investment banker to make certain that a seemingly improbable rumor is in fact false
in the past not only would reputable professionals have rushed to check out such rumors with the company but companies listed on the major stock exchanges were encouraged by the exchanges to respond openly to such inquiries from securities analysts
today after <unk> <unk> plea there is an uncertainty that is both unfair and inefficient
in this light the comparative advantages of legislative law - making become clear n before it acts the legislature typically will hear the views of representatives of all those affected by its decision not just the immediate parties before the court and <unk> the legislature can frame bright line standards that create less uncertainty than the fact - bound decisions of courts
although legislative lines can result in under - inclusion which explains why the <unk> has long resisted a legislative definition of insider trading judicial lawmaking inevitably creates uncertainty because of the shadowy outer edges and implications of most judicial decisions
at least when the stakes are high uncertainty in turn results in overinclusion as individuals do not dare to approach an uncertain line closely
the federal mail and wire fraud statutes provide even better illustrations of the rapid evolution of a federal common law of white - collar crime
in <unk> the <unk> <unk> attempted in <unk> v. <unk> to halt the inexorable expansion of these statutes by adopting a rule of strict construction for ambiguous criminal statues
yet late last year <unk> effectively reversed this decision by enacting a one - sentence statute that defined fraud to include any scheme to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services
at a stroke this may criminalize all fiduciary breaches and possibly all misrepresentations by an agent or employee
such a statute illustrates the fundamental problem <unk> finds n it is easier to pass sweepingly moralistic prohibitions which the courts must thereafter interpret than to engage in the difficult line - drawing distinctions that are inherently its responsibility
we are confronted less with a judicial power grab than with a legislative giveaway
predictably when confronted with morally dubious behavior prosecutors will exploit the latitude <unk> such openended statutes give them
over the long run however sleazy cases will make bad law
<unk> <unk> is a professor at <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> posted a n decline in third - quarter net income to n million or n cents a share from n million or <unk> a share a year earlier

but the specialty - material segment slowed somewhat and consumer products continued below expectations
as for joint ventures <unk> <unk> said <unk> profit was essentially flat due primarily to a slow recovery at <unk> - <unk> <unk> in <unk> following a strike at a major customer and the disruption of shipments to <unk>

investors can get slightly higher yields on deposits below n than they can on deposits of <unk> and up
banks want to remain competitive said <unk> <unk> chairman of <unk>
<unk> is a big rollover month and perhaps they anticipate greater demand among people leaving the stock market

on average however three - month cds at major banks are yielding a tenth of a percentage point less than they were a week ago

six - month cds of <unk> and less yielded an average n in the week ended <unk> down from <unk> according to <unk>
the yield on six - month <unk> - bills fell to <unk> on <unk> from <unk> the week before

<unk> <unk> noted that actual rates are almost identical on small and large - denomination cds but yields on cds aimed at the individual investor are boosted by more frequent compounding
cds sold by major brokerage houses which like jumbo cds tend to closely follow interest rate trends also posted larger drops in yields
a six - month broker - sold cd for example was yielding an average n in the latest week a fifth of a percentage point lower than the week before
in late <unk> when interest rates were at their recent highs short - term cds sold by brokers were offering yields half a percentage point or more higher than banks

that puts pressure on cd rates
conservatives have an important decision n to make this fall
at the recent meetings of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> administration announced its intention to decide by yearend the size of the next increase in the <unk> capital base
while the <unk> share of the increase probably will not reach the <unk> billion or more implicit in the <unk> request for a doubling of its <unk> billion capital the administration probably will agree to a multibillion - dollar increase
this would be consistent with its unwavering support for the <unk> <unk> and <unk> exchange - rate intervention and with its financial commitment to <unk> <unk> and others
the <unk> has several reasons for requesting the increase
its role in the economies of developing countries has grown steadily since the <unk>
the size and pace of disbursements will accelerate further under the <unk> <unk> which promises larger and earlier disbursements to approved countries
at least three other factors have encouraged the <unk> to insist on increased capital
first it argues that its capital base must be increased in order to maintain its size relative to world financial markets for which it feels some responsibility
second the <unk> <unk> recent <unk> billion capital increase n billion from the <unk> has left the <unk> feeling less than first fiddle among international financial institutions
<unk> the <unk> would like to meet <unk> request for increased ownership currently n
<unk> has supported a larger role for the <unk> in developing - country debt issues and is an important financial resource for <unk> - guided programs in developing countries
while international politics may argue for the capital increase there is a clear economic case against it
opponents of the increase argue that the <unk> practices central planning while supporting ineffective governments
they question whether the <unk> has any role in developing countries given its original mandate to assist industrial countries in balance - of-payments emergencies
opponents show that there are already more funds available than commendable reform efforts
they worry that new <unk> funding of developing countries will simply end up substituting <unk> debt for reschedulable commercial bank debt a bad trade all around
they believe n microeconomics which addresses the problems of markets investment climate and management practices is the key to developing - country growth not the <unk> keynesian focus on trade deficits quarterly targets and government debt
they point at the numerous developing - country governments that have inflated taxed and regulated themselves into despair under successive <unk> programs
decisions on increases in the <unk> capital base traditionally are made by the administration with subsequent authorization by <unk>
the last <unk> congressional authorization in n was a political donnybrook and carried a n billion housing program along with it to secure adequate votes
the politics of the <unk> congressional authorization are likely to be similar to those of previous authorizations
liberals may support the stabilizing quasi - governmental role of the <unk> on two conditions that the administration give assurances that liberal democrats support will not be used against them in congressional re - election campaigns and that the legislation address with dollars social and environmental concerns
conservative republicans will be given the choice of supporting or fighting their party popular president in an election year
a <unk> decision to refuse the <unk> its capital increase or limit it to n would bring a major change in international economic policy and could not be taken lightly
commentators would fret over the implications for the <unk> coordination process and the stability of world financial markets
because commercial banks and the developing - country governments believe n they will get a piece of any capital increase a scaled - down <unk> mission would leave both feeling shortchanged
furthermore a <unk> rejection of the capital increase and transfer of shares to <unk> would give <unk> an argument against future calls for economic burden - sharing
on the other hand a decision to increase the <unk> capital would reinforce the central economic role of multilateral institutions in developing countries
with the increase even more developing - country energy and talent would be diverted from creating profitable economic systems to setting up economic planning ministries that generate <unk> - approved economic plans
upping the ante could slow economic development even further as countries delay market - opening steps in anticipation of richer multilateral support
conservatives should take a position prior to the administration year - end deadline
the issues are too important to be left to the financial and budget ministries fighting over the size of the capital increase rather than its purpose
if conservatives do n't support an increase in the <unk> capital then it is incumbent on them to speak up now and explain the alternative

<unk> has close to n million subscribers to its <unk> and <unk> networks while <unk> and its sister service the <unk> <unk> have only about n million according to <unk> <unk> associates a <unk> <unk> research firm
for <unk> the investment in <unk> puts it in an unusual position as the largest cable operator with control of close to n million of the nation n million cable subscribers <unk> is <unk> largest customer
but <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has long been concerned about <unk> dominance of the pay tv business and has been eager to keep <unk> as a healthy competitor
it is important to the cable industry that we have a vibrant and competitive pay - television marketplace <unk> <unk> said in a statement
in a telephone interview <unk> <unk> <unk> senior vice president said <unk> <unk> suit against <unk> does n't involve us and nothing n we doing here bears any relationship to that
he added we do n't intend to be drawn into it noting that <unk> wo n't play any active role in the management of <unk>
linking up <unk> with the largest cable operator in the <unk> could sharply boost its subscribers

the <unk> investment is a big victory for <unk> chief executive officer <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> president of the <unk> unit
this takes any question of <unk> viability and puts it away once and for all <unk> <unk> said in a telephone interview
the fight between <unk> and <unk> is particularly acrimonious because <unk> <unk> is the former chief executive of <unk> and <unk> <unk> served as chief of marketing for the service

the federal government should make free voluntary testing for the <unk> virus the cornerstone of an expanded campaign to stop the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome the <unk> <unk> recommended <unk>
by encouraging massive routine voluntary testing we can enable society to voluntarily segregate itself sexually into two groups those who carry the virus and those who do not the <unk> research organization said in a new report
the report takes a more alarmed view of <unk> and recommends a more sweeping response than many other analyses
it warns that the <unk> epidemic may reduce the rate of growth of the work force curb productivity gains and slow economic growth

an unexpectedly sharp widening in the <unk> trade gap for <unk> dragged the dollar lower <unk> but profit - taking on short positions helped the currency rebound to close mixed against major counterparts

observers said n it appeared that <unk> <unk> was angered at the way n the bid has degenerated into confusion as well as by the banks effort n to round up financing for what one called a deal that is n't a deal
the effort n to revive the bid was complicated by the unwieldy nature of the three - party buying group
the pilots were meeting outside <unk> yesterday
but british <unk> which was to have supplied n million out of n million in equity financing apparently was n't involved in the second proposal and could well reject it even if banks obtain financing
a group of <unk> <unk> employees said in a statement the fact that <unk> and other officers were going to line their pockets with literally millions of dollars while instituting severe pay cuts on the nonunion employees of <unk> is not only deplorable but inexcusable
the machinists also asked for an investigation by the securities and <unk> <unk> into possible securities - law violations in the original bid for <unk> by <unk> <unk> as well as in the response by <unk>
last week just before the bank commitments were due the union asked the <unk> <unk> <unk> to study whether the bid violated legal standards of fairness governing employee investment funds
in his statement <unk> <unk> said we continue to believe <unk> our approach is sound and that it is far better for all employees than the alternative of having an outsider own the company with employees paying for it just the same
<unk> <unk> has eschewed merger advice from a major <unk> <unk> securities firm relying instead only on a takeover lawyer <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the huge drop in <unk> stock prompted one takeover stock trader <unk> <unk> managing partner of <unk> <unk> <unk> to deny publicly rumors that his firm was going out of business
<unk> <unk> said that despite losses on <unk> stock his firm health is excellent
the stock decline also has left the <unk> board in a quandary
although it may not be legally obligated to sell the company if the buy - out group ca n't revive its bid it may have to explore alternatives if the buyers come back with a bid much lower than the group original <unk> proposal
at a meeting <unk> n to consider the labor - management bid the board also was informed by its investment adviser <unk> <unk> <unk> of interest expressed by buy - out funds including <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> as well as by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> buy - out fund and <unk> <unk> <unk>
the takeover - stock traders were hoping that <unk> <unk> or one of the other interested parties might re - emerge with the situation in disarray or that the board might consider a recapitalization
meanwhile japanese bankers said n they were still hesitant about accepting <unk> latest proposal
<unk> <unk> said n it plans a public offering of n million shares of its <unk> <unk> <unk> unit at <unk> to n a share
the offering for the language school unit was announced by <unk> <unk> chairman and chief executive officer of <unk> - based <unk> <unk> <unk> which owns <unk>
after the offering is completed <unk> will own about <unk> of the <unk> common stock outstanding
five million shares will be offered in the <unk> and n million additional shares will be offered in concurrent international offerings outside the <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> will manage the offering
<unk> said <unk> <unk> intends to pay quarterly dividends on the stock
the company said <unk> it expects to pay the first dividend of <unk> cents a share in the <unk> first quarter
<unk> will borrow an amount equal to its expected net proceeds from the offerings plus n million in connection with a credit agreement with lenders
the total borrowing will be about n million the company said n
proceeds from the borrowings under the credit agreement will be used to pay an n million cash dividend to <unk> and to lend the remainder of about n million to <unk> communications in connection with a promissory note
proceeds from the offering will be used to repay borrowings under the short - term parts of a credit agreement
<unk> which is based in <unk> <unk> provides language instruction and translation services through more than n language centers in n countries
in the past five years more than n of its sales have been outside the <unk>
<unk> has owned <unk> since <unk>
in the first six months of this year <unk> posted net income of n million on sales of n million compared with net income of n million on sales of n million
right away you notice the following things about a <unk> <unk> concert
it attracts people with funny hair or with no hair in front of me a girl with spiked locks sat beside a boy who had shaved his
whoever constitute the local <unk> <unk> come out in force dressed in black along with a smattering of yuppies who want to be on the cutting edge
people in <unk> houses tend to look stoned
and if still conscious at the evening end you notice something else the audience at first entranced and hypnotized by the music releases its pent - up feelings in collective gratitude
currently in the middle of a four - week n tour as a solo pianist <unk> <unk> has left behind his synthesizers equipment and collaborators in favor of going it alone
he sits down at the piano and plays
and plays
either one likes it or one does n't
the typical <unk> audience which is more likely to be composed of music students than their teachers certainly does
the work though sounds like <unk> for spaceships
<unk> <unk> is the emperor and his music the new clothes of the avant - garde
his success is easy n to understand
softly introducing and explaining his pieces <unk> <unk> looks and sounds more like a shaggy poet describing his work than a classical pianist playing a recital
the piano compositions which have been labeled variously as minimalist <unk> repetitive cyclical monophonic and hypnotic are relentlessly tonal therefore unthreatening unvaryingly rhythmic therefore soporific and unflaggingly harmonious but unmelodic therefore both pretty and unconventional
it is music for people who want to hear something different but do n't want to work especially hard at the task
it is e - z listening for the now generation
<unk> <unk> has inverted the famous modernist dictum less is more
his more is always less
far from being minimalist the music unabatingly torments us with apparent novelties not so cleverly disguised in the simplicities of n time octave intervals and ragtime or gospel chord progressions
but the music has its charm and <unk> <unk> has constructed his solo program around a move from the simple to the relatively complex
opening n from <unk> introduces the audience to the <unk> technique never straying too far from the piano center <unk> <unk> works in the two octaves on either side of middle <unk> and his fingers seldom leave the keys
there is a recognizable musical style here but not a particular performance style
the music is not especially pianistic indeed it hard to imagine a bad performance of it
nothing bravura no arpeggios no ticklish fingering problems challenge the performer
we hear we may think inner voices but they all seem to be saying the same thing
with <unk> <unk> music meant to accompany readings of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> gets going
his hands sit farther apart on the keyboard
seventh chords make you feel as though he may break into a very slow improvisatory riff
the chords modulate but there is little filigree even though his fingers begin to wander over more of the keys
contrasts predictably accumulate <unk> the music is loud then it becomes soft then you realize it becomes louder again
the <unk> <unk> play an interlude from <unk> on the <unk> is like a toccata but it does n't seem to move much beyond its left - hand ground in three blind mice
when <unk> <unk> decides to get really fancy he crosses his hands and hits a resonant bass note with his right hand
he does this in at least three of his solo pieces
you might call it a leitmotif or a virtuoso accomplishment
in <unk> <unk> which came from a commission to write a piece of indeterminate length <unk> <unk> charmingly and tellingly confessed that this was no problem for me an <unk> section alternates with a b section several times before the piece ends unresolved
not only is the typical <unk> open - ended it is also often multiple in its context s
mad <unk> began its life as the accompaniment to the <unk> <unk> first public address in the <unk> when <unk> <unk> played it on the organ at <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> the <unk>
later it was performed on <unk> <unk> in <unk> and then <unk> <unk> took it for one of her dance pieces
the point is that any piece can be used as background music for virtually anything
the evening ended with <unk> <unk> <unk> another multiple work
parts n n and n come from the soundtrack of <unk> <unk> acclaimed film the <unk> <unk> line and the two other parts from incidental music to two separate dramatizations of the <unk> story of the same name
when used as background in this way the music has an appropriate eeriness as when a two - note phrase a descending minor third accompanies the seemingly endless litany of reports interviews and confessions of witnesses in the <unk> film
served up as a solo however the music lacks the resonance provided by a context within another medium
admirers of <unk> <unk> may agree with the critic <unk> <unk> sense that the <unk> <unk> in twelve parts is as encyclopedic and weighty as the <unk> - <unk> <unk>
but while making the obvious point that both composers develop variations from themes this comparison ignores the intensely claustrophobic nature of <unk> <unk> music
its supposedly austere minimalism overlays a bombast that makes one yearn for the astringency of neoclassical <unk> the genuinely radical minimalism of <unk> and <unk> and what in retrospect even seems like concision in <unk>
<unk> <unk> is professor of <unk> at <unk> <unk> <unk> and editor of the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> said <unk> it hopes to complete shortly the first of two sales of shares in its japanese joint venture <unk> - <unk> for about n million
the company would n't disclose the buyer of the initial <unk> stake
proceeds of the sale expected to be completed next week would be used to repurchase as many as n million shares of <unk> stock the company said n
<unk> said n it is negotiating the sale of a second stake in <unk> - <unk> but indicated n it intends to hold at least n of the joint venture stock long term
a <unk> stake would allow <unk> to include <unk> earnings in its results
<unk> previously said n it intended to reduce its holding in the japanese concern as part of a restructuring plan which also calls for a reduction of dependence on weapons sales
yesterday a spokeswoman said n the company was pleased with our progress in that regard and hopes to provide additional details soon
<unk> said <unk> its <unk> and <unk> systems group incurred delays in shipping some undisclosed contracts during the third quarter resulting in lower operating profit for that business
overall <unk> reported earnings of n million or <unk> a share for the three months ended <unk> n compared with a loss of n million or n cents a share a year earlier
the previous period results included a n million pretax charge related to unrecoverable contract costs and a n million pretax gain on real estate sales
sales for the latest quarter were flat at <unk> billion
for the nine months <unk> reported earnings of n million or <unk> a share compared with earnings of n million or <unk> a share a year earlier
sales declined slightly to n billion
once again your editorial page misstates the law n to conform to your almost beatific misperceptions
in an excursus of little relevance to his central point about private enforcement suits by environmental groups <unk> <unk> <unk> informs your readers the <unk> <unk> <unk> is written upon the presumption the pretense rather that nothing but zero risk will do it establishes a legal standard of zero discharge <unk> 's environmental <unk> <unk> n
this statement surely buttresses your editorial viewpoint that environmental protection is generally silly or excessive but it is simply wrong
the <unk> <unk> <unk> contains no legal standard of zero discharge
it requires that discharges of pollutants into the waters of the <unk> <unk> be authorized by permits that reflect the effluent limitations developed under section n
whatever may be the problems with this system it scarcely reflects zero risk or zero discharge
perhaps <unk> <unk> was confused by <unk> meaningless statement of the national goal in section n which indeed calls for the elimination of discharges by <unk> no less
this fatuous statement was not taken seriously when enacted in <unk> and should not now be confused with the operative provisions of the statute
thus you do the public a great disservice when <unk> <unk> suggests even facetiously that the <unk> <unk> <unk> prohibits the preparation of a scotch and water your tippling readers may be led to believe that nothing but chance or oversight protects them as they cower in the night with their scotch and waters from the hairyknuckled knock of the <unk> <unk> at their doors
<unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> the sixth - largest <unk> magazine is attracting more readers than ever and offers the glossy high - toned pages that upscale advertisers love
so why did advertising pages plunge by almost n and ad revenue by <unk> in the first half
to hear advertisers tell it the magazine just has n't kept up with the times
despite renewed interest by the public in such topics as the environment and the <unk> <unk> it has n't been able to shake its reputation as a magazine n boys like to flip through in search of topless tribe women
worse it lagged behind competitors in offering now - standard gimmicks from regional editions to discounts for frequent advertisers
but now the magazine is attempting to fight back with an ambitious plan including a revamped sales strategy and a surprisingly aggressive ad campaign
advertisers do n't think of the magazine first says <unk> <unk> <unk> who joined in <unk> as national advertising director
what we want to do is take a more aggressive stance
people did n't believe n we were in tune with the marketplace and in many ways we were n't
the <unk> magazine has never had to woo advertisers with quite so much fervor before
it largely rested on its hard - to-fault demographics n million subscribers in the first half up from n million a year ago an average age of n for readers at the height of their consuming years loyalty to the tune of an <unk> average subscription renewal rate
the magazine had its best year yet in <unk> when it celebrated its centennial and racked up a <unk> gain in ad pages to <unk>
but this year when the hullabaloo surrounding its centennial died so too did some advertiser interest
the reason ad executives say <unk> is that the entire magazine business has been soft and <unk> <unk> has some quirks that make it especially unattractive during a soft market
perhaps the biggest of those factors is its high ad prices n for a four - color page vs. n for the <unk> a comparable publication with a far smaller circulation
when ad dollars are tight the high page cost is a major deterrent for advertisers who generally want to appear regularly in a publication or not at all
even though <unk> <unk> offers far more readers than does a magazine like <unk> the page costs you an arm and a leg to develop any frequency says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> media manager for <unk> <unk>
to combat that problem <unk> <unk> like other magazines began offering regional editions allowing advertisers to appear in only a portion of its magazines for example ads can run only in the magazines sent to subscribers in the largest n markets
but the magazine was slower than its competitors to come up with its regional editions and until last year offered fewer of them than did competitors
<unk> magazine for example has more than n separate editions going to different regions top management and other groups
another sticking point for advertisers was <unk> <unk> tradition of lumping its ads together usually at the beginning or end of the magazine rather than spreading ads out among its articles as most magazines do
and <unk> <unk> smaller - than-average size means extra production costs for advertisers
but <unk> <unk> says <unk> the magazine is fighting back
it now offers <unk> regional editions it very recently began running ads adjacent to articles and it has been beefing up its sales force
and it just launched a promotional campaign n to tell chief executives marketing directors and media executives just that
the centerpiece of the promotion is its new ad campaign into which the magazine will pour about <unk> mostly in the next few weeks
the campaign created by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> agency takes advantage of the eye - catching photography that <unk> <unk> is known for
in one ad a photo of the interior of the <unk> - <unk> in <unk> is paired with the headline the only book more respected than ours does n't accept advertising
another ad pictures a tree ant magnified n times with the headline for impact far beyond your size consider our regional editions
<unk> <unk> says <unk> she wants the campaign to help attract advertisers in <unk> categories including corporate financial services consumer electronics insurance and food
her goal to top n ad pages in <unk> up from about <unk> this year
whether she can meet that ambitious goal is still far from certain
the ad campaign is meant to contemporize the thought of <unk> <unk> she says
we want it to be a <unk> kind of image
<unk> plans ad - unit
<unk> <unk> hopes to announce perhaps today an agreement to sell the majority of its ad unit to <unk> - based <unk> a european ad executive said n
<unk> has been in discussions with <unk> for several months
however when negotiations bogged down recently <unk> chief executive <unk> <unk> met in <unk> with another french firm <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk>
according to the executive <unk> involvement prompted renewed vigor in the <unk> - <unk> talks and the two agencies were hoping to hammer out details by today
executives of the two agencies could n't be reached last night

the <unk> futures <unk> <unk> plans to restrict dual trading on commodity exchanges a move almost certain to infuriate exchange officials and traders
the <unk> said n it will propose the restrictions after the release of a study that shows little economic benefit resulting from dual trading and cites problems associated with the practice
dual trading gives an exchange trader the right n to trade both for his own account and for customers
the issue exploded this year after a <unk> <unk> of <unk> operation led to charges of widespread trading abuses at the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
while not specifically mentioned in the <unk> charges dual trading became a focus of attempts to tighten industry regulations
critics contend that traders were putting buying or selling for their own accounts ahead of other traders customer orders
traders are likely to oppose such restrictions because dual trading provides a way n to make money in slower markets where there is a shortage of customer orders
the exchanges contend that dual trading improves liquidity in the markets because traders can buy or sell even when they do n't have a customer order in hand
the exchanges say n liquidity becomes a severe problem for thinly traded contracts such as those with a long time remaining before expiration
the <unk> may take those arguments into account by allowing exceptions to its restrictions
the agency did n't cite specific situations where dual trading might be allowed but smaller exchanges or contracts that need additional liquidity are expected to be among them
<unk> <unk> the agency chairman told the <unk> <unk> <unk> that she expects the study to be released within two weeks and the rule changes to be completed by <unk>
the study by the <unk> division of economic analysis shows that a trade is a trade a member of the study team said
whether a trade is done on a dual or non - dual basis the member said <unk> does n't seem to have much economic impact
currently most traders on commodity exchanges specialize in trading either for customer accounts which makes them brokers or for their own accounts as socalled locals
the tests indicate that dual and non - dual traders are similar in terms of the trade executions and liquidity n they provide to the market <unk> <unk> told the <unk> panel
members of <unk> have proposed restricting dual trading in bills n to reauthorize <unk> operations
the <unk> bill would prohibit dual trading in markets with daily average volume of <unk> contracts or more comprising those considered too difficult n to track without a sophisticated computer system
the <unk> bill would force the <unk> to suspend dual trading if an exchange ca n't show that its oversight system can detect dual - trading abuses
so far one test of restricting dual trading has worked well
the <unk> <unk> banned dual trading in its <unk> <unk> <unk> index futures pit in <unk>
under the rules traders decide before a session begins whether they will trade for their own account or for customers
traders who stand on the pit top step where most customer orders are executed ca n't trade for themselves
a <unk> spokesman said n the plan has n't made much difference in liquidity in the pit
it too soon to tell but people do n't seem to be unhappy with it he said
he said n he would n't comment on the <unk> plan until the exchange has seen the full proposal
but at a meeting last week <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> president told commodity lawyers dual trading is definitely worth saving
it adds something to the market
japanese firms push posh car
japanese luxury - car makers are trying to set strict design standards for their dealerships
but some dealers are negotiating looser terms while others decline to deal at all
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> division likes to insist that every dealer construct and furnish a building in a japanese style
specifications include a polished bronze sculpture at the center of each showroom and a tile bridge spanning a stream that flows into the building from outside
<unk> has it down to the ashtrays says <unk> <unk> a partner at <unk> <unk> associates an auto research firm
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> division also provides specifications
but only two - thirds of <unk> dealers are constructing new buildings according to the <unk> specs
some are even coming up with their own novel designs
in <unk> <unk> for example <unk> <unk> has built a <unk> dealership with the showroom on the second floor
yet some dealers have turned down <unk> or <unk> franchises because they were unwilling or unable to meet the design requirements
<unk> <unk> of <unk> says <unk> <unk> was a bear on interiors but at least let him retrofit an existing building without the stream
<unk> <unk> says n he turned down a <unk> franchise in part because the building was gorgeous but very expensive
to head off arguments <unk> offers dealers cash bonuses and low - interest construction loans
dictation <unk> <unk> plays back a
products don't have to be first to be winners
that the lesson offered through one case study featured in a design exhibit
<unk> <unk> was caught off guard in <unk> when its main competitor <unk> <unk> products of <unk> introduced a microcassette dictation recorder half the size of standard cassette devices
blocked by patent protection from following suit <unk> decided to go a step further and cut the cassette in half again down to the length of a paperclip
by n designers and engineers at <unk> a <unk> <unk> subsidiary had produced a working model of a picocassette recorder
by <unk> however the patent status of the <unk> microcassette had changed permitting dictaphone to develop its own competitive micro system which it did
marketing and sales departments then urged abandonment of the pico project
but others said <unk> pico should proceed
both were right
<unk> went ahead and introduced the pico in <unk> but it has n't sold well
to date says <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> vice president it has broken even or shown a small loss
nevertheless the device has been successful in other ways
it helped <unk> attract better engineers and it provided new technology for other company products
the picocassette recorder also helped transform the company reputation from follower to leading - edge innovator
it gave me great pride to see the inventor of the microcassette in <unk> look at the pico and shake his head and say unbelievable says <unk> <unk>
<unk> picocassette recorder is one of n case studies in the <unk> <unk> <unk> sponsored by the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
the studies are on exhibit at <unk> this month and will travel to <unk> <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> at <unk>
a <unk> <unk> means branching
one <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> was raking some sycamore leaves but the rake kept riding up over the piles
the harder he tried to push them into large piles the closer he came to breaking the rake and straining his back
so <unk> <unk> then vice president of the <unk> <unk> <unk> took a steel - toothed garden rake and taped it to the underside of a leaf rake about nine inches up
his crude device worked the lower teeth gathered the leaves into a pile while the higher harder teeth moved the top of the pile
now incorporated into a polypropylene rake the four - inch prongs or wonderbars also are supposed to aid in picking up leaves
one customer <unk> <unk> of <unk> says <unk> the <unk> rake allowed him to do his lawn in <unk> n hours two hours less than usual
but other rake makers have their doubts
<unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> says <unk> the <unk> rake makes sense but it would be tough n to explain to consumers
<unk> <unk> marketing director for <unk> <unk> <unk> a subsidiary of <unk> <unk> says n people do n't want to move a leaf pile
they either pick it up he says or they start pulling from a fresh direction
odds and
no more stubbed toes or bruised shins promises <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> the designer of a bed support n to replace traditional frames
four tubular steel bedfellows each roughly in the shape of a <unk> are attached to the bottom of the box spring in a recessed position
nearly half of <unk> consumers say n they pay up to n more for packaging that can be recycled or is biodegradable according to a survey commissioned by the <unk> <unk> <unk> a design consultant
the <unk> is a haunted house
living there for six years was really scary
the ghosts of the past are everywhere they are kept at bay only by feeding them vast quantities of our defense budget
some can be bought off relatively cheaply
during the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> demanded and got in addition to his <unk> command in <unk> his own naval command in <unk> <unk>
those obsolete operations cost less than n billion a year and keep <unk> ghost quiet
that about all <unk> it costs to appease <unk> <unk> <unk> ghost
in n <unk> and the german navy threatened to attack the <unk> <unk> so we created the <unk> <unk> in <unk>
the <unk> <unk> has grown even bigger since the war because <unk> ghost sometimes runs through the e ring dressed like <unk> <unk>
the <unk> huge bureaucracy is needed to analyze whether leaders of coups against <unk> <unk> meet the <unk> powers <unk> six points <unk> <unk> seven points the <unk> <unk> <unk> points and <unk> <unk> <unk> points necessary to justify <unk> support
so far no one has
the ghost of the soviet brigade discovered in <unk> back in the n costs just a few hundred million the price of the <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> created in <unk>
the brigade has n't been heard from since but we keep the staff around just in case
<unk> <unk> ghost is much more difficult to keep happy
we keep a lot of shrines to him around the <unk> statues busts relics and such
the <unk> headquarters on the third deck of the <unk> used to burn a lot of incense to him but the <unk> headquarters on the fourth deck made them stop it
you see <unk> had this thing about the <unk> and the marines he wanted to make them part of the <unk> but <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> blocked him
now his ghost wo n't let up till it done
to keep him quiet we invent a new unified command every year or so run by the <unk> or the <unk> <unk> and put more of the <unk> and marines under it
but we still hear him moaning at night because the <unk> has a few ships left and to satisfy him the <unk> sea lift forces were given to a new <unk> <unk> bureaucracy in <unk> its space operations to another command in <unk> the frogmen to a new <unk> bureaucracy in <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> forces to an <unk> bureaucracy in <unk>
which brings up the worst and meanest ghost of all the ghost of the shah of <unk>
when the shah died <unk> <unk> was so scared that the shah ghost would blame him for shoving him out to make way for the ayatollah that he declared the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> said n he would go to war to stop anyone from trying to grab <unk>
but that ghost would n't settle for words he wanted money and people lots
so <unk> <unk> formed three new <unk> divisions and gave them to a new bureaucracy in <unk> called the <unk> <unk> <unk>
but that ghost was n't fooled he knew <unk> the <unk> was neither rapid nor deployable nor a force even though it cost n billion or n billion a year
after <unk> <unk> was defeated in <unk> the shah ghost claimed the credit and then went after <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
i saw what he did to them firsthand
it made my shoelaces dance with terror
why he used to lay in wait for <unk> suddenly he leap from behind some statue of <unk> onto <unk> chest and grab him by the throat and choke him till he coughed up an additional n billion or so
<unk> added four more divisions to the <unk> two active and two reserve two carrier groups to the <unk> a division equivalent to the marines and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and a thousand tactical aircraft to the <unk> <unk>
he bought <unk> billion in prepositioning ships and n billion in ammo and equipment n to fill them and parked them at a new n billion base at <unk> <unk> in the middle of the <unk> <unk>
he dedicated all these new forces to the <unk> <unk>
one night both <unk> ghost and the shah ghost together caught <unk> and threw him to the ground
before they let him go he added a thousand bureaucrats to the <unk> in <unk> and renamed it <unk> <unk>
he gave those bureaucrats charge of all naval operations in the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> figured n it would be good training for those soldiers someday maybe they would get the whole <unk>
they had fun moving the carriers around but it turned out that they had forgotten all about mine sweepers
but the shah still kept leaping out at <unk> so <unk> bought a hundred merchant ships more and n billion of loading barges ramps etc . in order that those seven new <unk> divisions and three <unk> brigades could unload from all those new ships and aircraft and go to war in the <unk> mountains
then suddenly <unk> ghost came to visit and said what the hell are you doing planning for a land war in <unk> <unk> miles away
we get our asses kicked
<unk> for <unk> <unk> was easygoing and soon went away while the shah he kept coming back
so the <unk> found itself paying about <unk> billion in baksheesh to various arab potentates for basing rights around the <unk> <unk>
we had great success in <unk>
but then it turned out that <unk> <unk> <unk> was not at all a nice person and the <unk> pointed out that the base n he promised us in <unk> had silted up about a hundred years ago and anyway was <unk> miles from the mouth of the <unk>
but who counting
still <unk> was the best n we could get so we stay in bed with <unk> <unk>
all these reports about him committing genocide are probably exaggerated anyway
but would n't you know now that we are spending jillions of dollars and have built those new divisions and new air wings and have positioned all these ships and supplies to fight the russians in <unk> the russians seem to have lost interest in the whole subject
meanwhile <unk> is cutting huge chunks out of the rest of the defense budget
predictably some <unk> guys said do we still need to keep all <unk> <unk> divisions on active duty and all those extra land - based aircraft without bases and all those <unk> guys playing admiral in <unk>
could n't we save n billion or n billion a year by shifting that stuff to the reserves
and why not save the costs of a thousand bureaucrats by abolishing <unk> <unk> and putting responsibility for <unk> naval operations back where it belongs afloat with the task force commander in the <unk>
and where were all our handsomely paid <unk> <unk> allies last year when our convoys were being attacked
questions like that really stir up <unk> ghost
he appeared late one night in the bedroom of the new defense secretary <unk> <unk>
<unk> came clanking in like <unk> ghost dragging those chains of brigades and air wings and links with arab despots
he would n't leave until <unk> <unk> promised to do whatever the <unk> systems analysts told him
so next day <unk> <unk> went out and did just that he canceled the <unk> <unk> and cut back one carrier and n frigates
then he canceled production of the <unk> most important carrier aircraft the n and the n
on the other hand <unk> <unk> retained all those new land forces
<unk> ghost is satisfied for now but he be back
what with <unk> coming and bigger defense cuts looming more and more <unk> bureaucrats are crawling under their desks
they know that they can hold off the ghosts only a little while longer by cutting carriers and ships
then the whole thing will start to collapse just as it did in the <unk> and the ghosts and banshees will be howling through the place turning people hair white
gives me the willies just thinking about it
<unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> secretary is a managing director of <unk>
the metal and marble lobby of <unk> <unk> headquarters is grander than your average savings and loan
for one thing there is an old master on the wall <unk> <unk> <unk> a big baroque canvas painted by <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>
at the moment however the painting is a nagging reminder of the problems that have engulfed <unk> and its flamboyant chairman and chief executive <unk> <unk> <unk>
in an international buying spree that began barely two years ago <unk> <unk> amassed a collection of about <unk> <unk> works including the <unk> at a total cost of n million
by midnight <unk> <unk> all of the paintings were supposed to have been sold off under orders from <unk> comptroller whose office regulates the state s&ls
<unk> did n't meet the deadline
the collection was at the heart of a grandiose plan <unk> <unk> <unk> had in which the art was to do double duty as an investment for <unk> and as decoration for the <unk> new office tower designed by <unk> <unk>
the rub is that the <unk> million was plucked from the funds of this federally insured institution even as <unk> was losing money hand over fist
<unk> <unk> had no right to buy art for the s&l in the first place it is n't on the comptroller permissible list without seeking a special dispensation which he did not do
besides that some of the paintings that were to grace the walls of <unk> actually ended up hanging in the chairman estate on <unk> <unk> <unk> off <unk> <unk>
last spring the comptroller office called a halt to <unk> <unk> fling giving him six months n to sell the paintings
the acquisitions officials said n in a letter to <unk> <unk> were unsafe unsound and unauthorized
so far <unk> <unk> has unloaded but three of his masterpieces he wo n't say to whom
the comptroller office says n it is monitoring the situation
though the agency could remove <unk> <unk> it has no current intention to do that
it not like selling chevrolets <unk> <unk> says as he takes a drag on a goldbanded <unk> <unk> cigarette
the last six months has established the quality of the collection
there no fire sale here
despite <unk> <unk> characteristic hauteur the <unk> chain - smoking dynamo is finding that getting <unk> <unk> largest thrift institution out of its riskiest investments is much tougher than getting into them had been
paintings are just part of the picture
although <unk> <unk> has pared a <unk> billion junk - bond portfolio to less than n million since <unk> the high - yield debt market has plummeted
divesting itself of what is left as is required of all thrift institutions by <unk> <unk> under the new federal s&l bailout law may well prove difficult
and <unk> has other problems
late last week federal regulators ordered the thrift institution to stop paying dividends on its preferred stock a move that suggests deep concern about an institution
<unk> <unk> has a plan to bring in n million by selling off n of <unk> <unk> branches but it has yet to be approved by regulators
it is <unk> <unk> art venture however that has drawn the most attention from investors and regulators not to mention galleries throughout the world
embittered shareholders some of whom are suing say <unk> the chairman and his collection epitomize the excesses of speculation that set off the national s&l crisis
<unk> shares have fallen sharply in price from a high of <unk> in <unk> to close yesterday at <unk>
<unk> directors meanwhile say <unk> <unk> <unk> and others of his ilk have left an indelible mark on the art world and not for the better
collectors do n't say it a van <unk> anymore laments <unk> <unk> <unk> the president of <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> gallery
they say <unk> <unk> got n million for his so certainly n million is n't too much for mine
the great collectors n we depended on such as <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> have stopped buying and the new buyers are brilliant men who made money in the stock market or in takeovers and rushed into collecting
<unk> <unk> an art dealer and collector sold <unk> <unk> <unk> irises at a <unk> auction in <unk> <unk> to australian businessman <unk> <unk>
trouble is <unk> <unk> has yet to pay up and until he does <unk> has the painting under lock and key
when <unk> <unk> moved in on the art market he let it be known that virtually no piece was too costly n to be considered by <unk>
he established his reputation as a freespender in <unk> last year at <unk> auction of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> collection in <unk> <unk>
there on one of his first shopping trips <unk> <unk> picked up several paintings at stunning prices
he paid n million for instance for a still life by <unk> <unk> . den <unk> that was expected to fetch perhaps n
the price paid was a record for the artist
some n of items offered at the <unk> auction were sold at an average price of <unk>
the rest were withdrawn for lack of acceptable bids
afterward <unk> <unk> is said by <unk> <unk> to have phoned <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> developer selling the collection and gloated
he says n he stole them recalls <unk> <unk>
and he tells me if you want to see your paintings you have to come to my house in <unk>
<unk> <unk> denies phoning and gloating
it just not true he says
<unk> <unk> quickly became more aggressive in his collecting with the help of <unk> <unk> a <unk> expert in old masters whom he met at an exhibition of the <unk> items
<unk> <unk> who became his principal adviser searched galleries in <unk> <unk> and <unk>
and according to one dealer <unk> <unk> had a penchant for introducing <unk> <unk> with the phrase he can buy anything
<unk> <unk> the president of the <unk> <unk> <unk> gallery in <unk> <unk> sold <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> says <unk> <unk> <unk> was known to spend a lot of money
people were interested in seeing him but it was recognized that the route was through <unk> and particularly <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> thus developed a close symbiotic relationship with <unk>
<unk> <unk> was eager to assemble a collection for the headquarters <unk> <unk> has been moving into for the greater part of a year
<unk> the auction house founded in <unk> <unk> and now under the umbrella of <unk> <unk> <unk> was hoping to stir up interest in old masters as it strove to build its <unk> business
european dealers continued to dominate the action in old masters which <unk> <unk> <unk> had lately been touting in this country
for several months there was optimism all around
last <unk> <unk> <unk> paid out n million of <unk> cash plus a n million commission for <unk> of a <unk> as <unk>
the painting attributed to flemish artist <unk> <unk> <unk> was purchased privately through <unk> not at auction
in <unk> <unk> just n months into his campaign <unk> <unk> was named by <unk> <unk> magazine as one of the top n individual collectors in the <unk>
an unknown quantity to most of the art world <unk> is no stranger to lavish spending the magazine said noting that he does n't stop at paint on canvas but also spends big on art n you can eat
he recently bid n at a <unk> charity auction for a dinner cooked by six of the world great chefs but the final party cost closer to <unk>
<unk> <unk> says <unk> it was n't that high
the art collection might have come to rival the <unk> had the <unk> comptroller office not got wind of <unk> <unk> aesthetic adventure
in its letter to him dated <unk> n and shared with reporters <unk> <unk> the chief of the thrift - institution bureau in the comptroller office expressed puzzlement that the s&l could be so profligate when it had reported losses of more than n million in its two preceding quarters
the state gave <unk> <unk> days n to sell the <unk>
the comptroller office eventually extended the deadline to six months but broadened its demands ordering that the book value of the collection be reduced to zero
in other words get rid of all the pictures
the state obliquely noted that unsafe banking practices are grounds for removing an officer or director and closed with the admonition to <unk> <unk> <unk> yourself accordingly
the state agency was particularly vexed to learn that the <unk> and a half - dozen other paintings listed among the bank furniture and fixtures were actually hanging in the chairman house
<unk> <unk> says that at one point he did indeed have eight or nine of the paintings at home and that the rest were in storage at <unk>
he explains that he was merely storing the paintings at home with some display because of the special dehumidified environment required for their safekeeping until <unk> new building was ready for them
still the incident was embarrassing
it came on the heels of a number of local newspaper articles suggesting that <unk> <unk> has benefited handsomely from his association with <unk>
for instance he got a n million loan from the <unk> negotiated at a below - market rate
he owns n of <unk> shares
adding to <unk> <unk> problems dealers some with vested interests insist that he relying rather too heavily on <unk> advice paid much too much for several pieces in the <unk> collection
the n million lavished on the <unk> for example was a record price for the artist and maybe twice its value given a dispute among scholars about its provenance
<unk> <unk> the president of <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> gallery says n scholars question the authenticity of the <unk>
it may have been painted instead by a <unk> associate
the feeling among many experts on the commercial side is that the price paid at the time was excessive in any event <unk> <unk> says
it sounds like with the <unk> he got absolutely taken to the cleaners
<unk> <unk> the executive director of the appraisers <unk> of <unk> agrees that <unk> <unk> paid very dearly for the <unk> and adds that getting rid of it any time soon for a similar sum would be quite a feat
it not beyond credibility n the <unk> will someday be worth n million but whether it could be sold for that amount tomorrow remains to be seen
still predicting is tricky
i forever dumbfounded by what i see making these high prices
<unk> <unk> <unk> the son of the painting former owner <unk> <unk> <unk> dismisses the price talk as sour grapes
dealers contemptuous of the purchase price he says <unk> were themselves interested in buying the <unk> but lost out
<unk> <unk> for his part defends the <unk> price saying n a lot of the experts have never seen the thing itself
most of them were n't even born the last time n the painting was displayed publicly he says
art prices are skyrocketing but a good deal of legerdemain is involved in compiling statistics on sales
<unk> <unk> <unk> the investment - banking firm in its annual tally of investment returns reported that old masters appreciated n in the year ended <unk> <unk> the greatest return of any of <unk> assets n it tracked
impressionist and modern paintings not tracked by <unk> are ranked even higher at <unk> by <unk>
<unk> moreover gets its data on art appreciation from <unk> whose prices go up with clients like <unk> <unk> in its thrall
the percentages omit from consideration the many paintings that go begging at auction
art indexes track winners not losers
but art that has fallen sharply in value is rarely put up for sale
also at any of <unk> auctions of old masters roughly one - third to one - fifth of what is offered does n't sell at any price
it not that there are n't any bids but the bids do n't meet the minimum reserve prices set by the sellers
in <unk> the <unk> painting that now hangs at <unk> was expected to bring no more than n at auction until <unk> <unk> came along with his n million
<unk> <unk> of the <unk> gallery says <unk> <unk> million would have been an impossible price n for anyone to ask for a <unk> four years ago
but from his vantage point it is n't that <unk> <unk> a customer of his too overpaid for the work a gargantuan painting by an artist who is not a household word
the painting is n feet wide seven feet high
rather it just shows n things have changed
<unk> <unk> boasts that he spotted bargains in old masters just before they took an upward turn
they went up <unk> last year and they do it again this year he declares
they were a sleeper
everybody was out buying monets
sotheby vice president <unk> <unk> says <unk> the auction house has been assisting <unk> <unk> in selling the paintings
and while <unk> chief rivals in the art world private art dealers wo n't be happy to hear it she adds n a number of the artworks have already been sold and at a substantial profit
<unk> <unk> claims to have sold three paintings at more than a n profit
that is n't <unk> and the claim is n't documented
he furthermore denies that he relied too heavily on <unk> or <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> says <unk> he had not one but four advisers and that he never bid impulsively
after all he had the counsel of curators from the most reputable museums in the world
he says n he expects to sell the collection including the controversial <unk> carefully and prudently just as it was put together
but in art - world parlance <unk> <unk> holdings are burnt
that is he is being compelled to put them on the market too soon and has already gotten offers that are less than he paid for some of the art works
after a few years you can argue n there has been natural appreciation says <unk> <unk> the publisher of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> auctions
but quick turnover in artwork is like pawning your jewelry you end up with <unk>
people hold out and try to get a bargain
<unk> defends itself and <unk> <unk> in the matter
<unk> <unk> says <unk> <unk> <unk> was a quick study who worked intensely and bought the best pictures available at the moment
on occasion he paid a high price <unk> <unk> concedes n but he says n those who bid less and dropped out were dealers who would then have marked up the paintings to resell them at a profit to collectors
<unk> <unk> <unk> a fine - arts appraiser at <unk> associates in <unk> <unk> considers it definite conflict of interest for an auction house to both advise a client on purchases and to set price estimates on the paintings n to be purchased
<unk> she says n is wearing both hats
i ca n't see why there would be a conflict of interest says <unk> <unk> <unk>
estimates are based on the previous price of similar works sold at auction and current market conditions and are not affected by any knowledge of who the potential buyer could be
frequently clients express interest in paintings but do n't end up bidding she adds n so we do n't know who the potential buyer will be
<unk> <unk> in selling off his paintings is seeking at least a n return on the bank investment so as to prove that the venture was sound
<unk> <unk> says that he has feelers out over much of the globe and that potential buyers from as far away as <unk> and <unk> have examined the collection
because of the pressure on <unk> to sell dealers and collectors have been trying to get the paintings at bargain - basement prices
but so far <unk> <unk> and his advisers are holding fast
one dealer <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> says n he would have loved to buy a <unk> <unk> de <unk> painting from the bank
i tried to steal the picture to buy it attractively and <unk> would n't do it
they were protecting his interests
meanwhile <unk> <unk> and <unk> executives are getting squeamish about opulence
<unk> <unk> has been characterized as the <unk> <unk> or something complains <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> an executive vice president of <unk>
the media she says n have distorted his personal life
<unk> <unk> nods in agreement
i do n't think <unk> i have a life style that is frankly so flamboyant he says
but at just that moment he is interrupted in his office by a servant in tuxedo who pours coffee from silver into a cup of china and dabs the brim with linen
<unk> <unk> says <unk> yes the ceiling in his executive suite is gold - leaf inlay
the offices are done in hardwood and oriental rugs leatherbound books and of course a n million <unk>
but he implores that the splendor be played down
do n't say n it a gold ceiling
just say <unk> the offices are tastefully appointed he says
otherwise the regulators will take it for decadence and nowadays everything got to be pristine

before the <unk> crash the <unk> was more than <unk>
the common view says <unk> <unk> <unk> strategist for <unk> <unk> <unk> is that there will be mild economic growth modest profit expansion and things are going to be hunky - dory

many brokerage house officials also are optimistic
yesterday <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> all increased the proportion of assets n they recommend n investors commit to stocks
<unk> <unk> now recommends <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> n
some investors say n <unk> sell - off was a good thing because it deflated a lot of crazy takeover speculation
it was a healthy cleansing says <unk> <unk> who runs <unk> brothers <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
from here out these investors see a return to old - fashioned investing based on a company ability to show profit growth
the fundamentals are pretty strong <unk> <unk> says
i do n't see this as a bear market at all
it a recognition that there was much too much fluff in the <unk> market
<unk> big fall was just a blunder by the stock market says <unk> <unk> <unk> chief strategist for <unk> <unk>
it was an overreaction to an event the failure of a management and union group to get bank financing for a takeover of <unk> that does n't mean that much to lots of stocks
many investors have nagging worries however
newspapers are full of headlines about companies defaulting on their debts and banks writing off real estate loans
that hurts investors confidence in the economy and stocks
not even all the brokerage firms see clear sailing ahead
disappointing profits are likely to get worse in the next two quarters says <unk> <unk> a market strategist at <unk>
she thinks n the market could drop about <unk> in the next few months then recover and go higher
companies with steady earnings growth could do well she says n while others with high debt or poor earnings could see their shares decline far more than n
the turmoil on <unk> <unk> may benefit some retailers attempting to lead leveraged buy - outs of their specialty and department - store chains investment bankers and retailers said n
managers at five chains have said in recent weeks that they intend to bid for their companies
the chains include <unk> owned by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> owned by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> owned by <unk> <unk> which is now being managed by a court - appointed provisional liquidator
<unk> is based in <unk> <unk>
the combination of so many chains available for sale the recent failures of such retailing lbo as <unk> <unk> <unk> and declining investor confidence will drive down prices retailing observers said n
the pricing will become more realistic which should help management said <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> investment banker with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
investors are n't going to be throwing money at any of the proposed lbos but doing deals on the basis of ridiculous assumptions never made sense either
earlier this year bankers and other investors were willing to provide financing because they assumed n there would be major gains in both profitability and sales <unk> <unk> added <unk>
those days are over now he believes n
competition from third parties who have cash and are prepared to buy has always existed and will continue added <unk> <unk>
but when prices were crazy it was even harder to do an lbo
bankers believed in the greater - fool theory that says n somebody else is always willing to pay more
this is no longer true today
at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> senior vice president marketing agreed that lower prices will help his management team in their proposed lbo
having to take on less debt would certainly be an advantage said <unk> <unk>
it would also help us in our search for equity partners
to make an lbo work now we are going to need more than just junk bonds
none believe <unk> the proposed management lbos will be easy to complete especially at <unk> <unk> <unk> which is under chapter n bankruptcy protection
not only could the <unk> <unk> gyrations damp <unk> sales if consumers lose confidence in the economy but potential junk - bond buyers are sure to demand even stronger covenants and greater management equity participation
further many institutions today holding troubled retailers debt securities will be reticent to consider additional retailing investments
it called bad money driving out good money said one retailing observer
institutions that usually buy retail paper have to be more concerned
however the lower prices n these retail chains are now expected to bring should make it easier for managers to raise the necessary capital and pay back the resulting debt
in addition the fall selling season has generally been a good one especially for those retailers dependent on apparel sales for the majority of their revenues
what encouraging about this is that retail chains will be sold on the basis of their sales and earnings not liquidation values said <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman and chief executive officer of <unk> <unk> <unk> a specialty chain
retailers who had good track records of producing profits will have a better chance to buy back their companies
still most retailing observers expect that all the proposed retailing lbos will depend partly on the sale of junk bonds a market already in tumult in part because of concerns associated with bonds issued by the <unk> and <unk> units of <unk>
prices for retail chains are lower today than they were last week which will help management said <unk> <unk> chairman of <unk> <unk> an investment - banking firm specializing in retailing acquisitions
but the hurdle of financing still has to be resolved
potential bondholders will either look for greater equity participation on behalf of management or insist <unk> the equity component of the deals be substantially greater than in the past
<unk> <unk> won a pretrial order blocking <unk> sales of <unk> products <unk> my own line of portable audio players for children

a federal appeals court struck down a natural - gas regulation that had prevented pipeline companies from passing to customers part of <unk> billion in costs from controversial take - or-pay contracts
the court in a n ruling threw out a deadline set by the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for settling old contract disputes over gas that the pipeline companies reserved but did n't use
<unk> regulation had given pipelines until <unk> <unk> <unk> to pass on to customers as much as <unk> of the costs of buying out their broken contracts which were made with producers when gas prices were high and supplies short
a majority of old contracts were renegotiated by the deadline and settled at steep discounts
but pipeline companies estimate <unk> they still face n billion in liabilities from unresolved disputes including <unk> billion n they fear <unk> they wo n't be able to pass on to customers
according to industry lawyers the ruling gives pipeline companies an important second chance to resolve remaining disputes and take advantage of the cost - sharing mechanism
the court left open whether <unk> could reimpose a new deadline later
the court agreeing with pipeline companies found n the <unk> n deadline was arbitrary and capricious and highly prejudicial to the bargaining power of pipelines that were forced to negotiate settlement of the old take - or-pay contracts to meet the deadline
a report last month by the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> found that pipelines settlement costs had jumped in the three months before the deadline to n cents on the dollar from n cents on the dollar in n
the court ordered <unk> to justify within <unk> days not only its cost - sharing deadline but other major elements of its proposed regulation for introducing more competition into natural - gas transportation
the court also questioned a crediting mechanism that could be used to resolve take - or-pay liabilities

many skittish mutual fund investors picked up the phone yesterday but decided not to cash in their chips after all
as the stock market bounced back withdrawals of money from stock funds amounted to a mere trickle compared with <unk> <unk> when investors dumped n billion or about n of stock - fund assets
<unk> investments the nation largest fund company said n phone volume was more than double its typical level but still half that of <unk> n <unk>
net outflows from <unk> stock funds stood at less than n million or below n of the <unk> billion cash position of the firm stock portfolios
much of the money was switched into the firm money market funds
outflows since the close of trading <unk> remain below one - third their level of two years ago <unk> said <unk>
other mutual fund companies reported even lighter withdrawal requests
and some investors at <unk> and elsewhere even began buying stock funds during the day
two years ago there was a lot of redemption activity and trouble with people getting through on the phone said <unk> <unk> head of the investment management division of the securities and <unk> <unk>
this time we do n't have that at all
of course the relative calm could be jolted if the market plunges again
and any strong surge in redemptions could force some funds to dump stocks to raise cash as some did during <unk> <unk>
but funds generally are better prepared this time around
as a group their cash position of <unk> of assets in <unk> the latest figure available is <unk> higher than two years earlier

many funds allow investors to void orders before the close of trading
at <unk> and at the smaller <unk> funds group in <unk> <unk> for instance some shareholders called early in the morning to switch money from stock funds to money market funds but later called back to reverse the switches
because mutual fund trades do n't take effect until the market close in this case at n p.m. these shareholders effectively stayed put
at <unk> office in downtown <unk> <unk> <unk> walked in shortly after n a.m. and placed an order to switch his retirement accounts out of three stock funds and into a money market fund
but by n p.m. with the market comfortably ahead for the day <unk> <unk> was preparing to undo his switch
it a nice feeling to know that things stabilized said <unk> <unk> the <unk> co - owner of a discount department store
but some investors continued to switch out of high - risk high - yield junk funds despite yesterday rebound from that market recent price declines
shareholders have been steadily bailing out of several big junk funds the past several weeks as the <unk> billion market was jolted by a cash crunch at <unk> <unk> and steadily declining prices

<unk> <unk> sold the softies under a sublicense from <unk> <unk> <unk> which had gained the rights from the <unk> <unk> of sciences
<unk> <unk> a <unk> invented them in <unk>

in <unk> <unk> <unk> officials seized bootlegged lenses made by unlicensed companies after some showed traces of bacteria
in <unk> doctors were debating the product safety some claiming n it caused infections

last month the <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> cautioned users that serious eye infections could result from wearing lenses more than seven days at a stretch

the roller - coaster stock market is making life tougher for small companies trying to raise money
in the wake of <unk> plunge and yesterday rebound some companies are already postponing deals and others wish <unk> they could
as in other jittery times many small businesses expect a particularly rough time raising funds as investors shun risky deals seeking safety in bigger companies
even if stock prices fully recover from <unk> sharp decline the unsettled conditions will frighten many investors
the implication of an unsettled situation is that the thing could drop dramatically says <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman of <unk> <unk> a four - year-old biotechnology company that is planning a private placement of stock
the more variables that indicate risk the more <unk> the investor is going to drive a hard bargain
earlier this month <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> office - supplies discounter said n it would accelerate expansion plans nationwide and offer more of its stock to the public
at the time its shares were selling above their initial offering price of <unk> and bankers believed <unk> <unk> would sell new stock without a hitch
but with the company shares standing at <unk> yesterday a new offering seems unlikely company officials say n
business however continues to be robust and the stock market has n't affected the concern expansion plans says <unk> <unk> <unk> a senior executive
other companies figure n they ca n't avoid the market
we have capital requirements says <unk> <unk> <unk> so we have to go ahead with a planned n billion private placement
unless the market goes right back up he says n it may take us six to nine months to find the money instead of three
and the <unk> <unk> company may have to settle for a lower price he adds n

officers of the company a health - care concern were very discouraged on <unk> and felt n they should n't go public we felt n they should says <unk> <unk> <unk> partner in the banking concern
as the market dropped <unk> <unk> <unk> slashed the value of the offering by <unk>
yesterday when similar securities rebounded it bumped the valuation up again
as of late yesterday the <unk> was still on
for many the situation is especially discouraging because the market for ipos was showing signs of strengthening after several years of weakness
we were just beginning to look at the increase in ipos seeing the light at the end of the tunnel says <unk> <unk> <unk> partner in <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> venture capital concern
but the tunnel just gotten longer
companies planning to go public are definitely taking a second look says <unk> <unk> <unk> senior analyst at the <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which publishes the <unk> issues newsletter on ipos
he calculates that the recent market slide translated into a n to n reduction in <unk> proceeds to companies
many companies are hesitating
<unk> <unk> had been planning to sell n of its stock this week in an ipo that would raise up to n million
but now <unk> <unk> president says we making decisions on a day - to-day basis

<unk> <unk> an <unk> computer - software concern says n it is still planning to go ahead with its ipo this week or next unless conditions change
it a wait - and-see situation right now says <unk> <unk> president
delayed financings also would affect the operations of many companies
<unk> <unk> <unk> . a <unk> <unk> operator of addiction - treatment centers has a planned doubling of capacity riding on an ipo scheduled for next week
<unk> <unk> president says n he still thinks <unk> the ipo will succeed
if it does n't he says n the company would have to change its expansion timetable

<unk> <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> says <unk> the market turmoil is an absolute non - event for small business

<unk> <unk> thinks <unk> rates are heading down helping small companies
<unk> <unk> biotechnology analyst for <unk> securities <unk> <unk> thinks n market uncertainty may encourage small companies to form more strategic alliances with big corporations
partly because the n market crash made it harder for them to find financing many high - technology concerns have made such alliances recently
some even see a silver lining in the dark clouds
<unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> merger specialist thinks <unk> panicky investors may lose their enthusiasm for leveraged buy - out and giant takeover deals

<unk> <unk> <unk> hurt by high debts and deteriorating real estate investments reported a wider loss for the fourth quarter and said <unk> it might be forced to seek a bankruptcy - court reorganization if it ca n't renegotiate its borrowings
<unk> said n a substantial part of its debt outstanding is in default as a result of inability to sell certain properties quickly and lower - than-expected prices for sales made
the company said <unk> its real estate portfolio is highly leveraged while about two - thirds of its investments are n't income - producing
thus it is coming up short on a big bet that quick sales at higher prices would enable it to keep up with mortgage and other debt payments
according to its latest annual report about a quarter of the company holdings are in <unk> in the midst of a real - estate slump
the company said <unk> it had a net loss in its fourth quarter ended <unk> <unk> of n million or <unk> a share on revenue of n million
a year earlier the company had a loss of n million or <unk> a share on revenue of n million
for the year it had a net loss of n million or <unk> a share on revenue of n million

c - yields adjusted for constant maturity
<unk> <unk> reported a n decline in third - quarter net income but the company said that excluding unusual gains in both quarters operating profit rose n
the electronics automotive and aerospace concern said <unk> third - quarter net was n million or n cents a share down from n million or <unk> a share a year earlier
share earnings are reported on a fully diluted basis by company tradition
results for the n quarter included a gain of <unk> a share from sale of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> units partly offset by a charge of n cents a share for recall of faulty truck steering systems
the latest quarter included a gain of <unk> cents a share as a partial reversal of the recall charge because the reserve established last year exceeded the actual recall costs
sales for the quarter rose <unk> to n billion from n billion with all three major product groups reporting gains
the company said n aerospace and defense sales were up n for the quarter to n million and operating profit climbed <unk> to n million mainly because of improved program performance in spacecraft and advanced - technology contracts
automotive sales jumped <unk> to n million mainly because of higher sales of air bags and other passenger restraint systems <unk> said n
the group had an operating profit of n million against a loss of n million a year earlier
however excluding the year - earlier charge for recall of steering gear operating profit in the latest quarter declined <unk> reflecting higher start - up and product development expenses in passenger - restraint systems
materials and production costs also rose <unk> said n

an acquisition accounted for half the sales rise <unk> said n
operating profit rose threefold to n million from n million

a tragicomic monologue by an idealistic not unheroic though sadly self - deceived english butler in his sixties proceeds as if the realistic english novel of manners like <unk> herself still ruled the waves
in fact <unk> <unk> the remains of the <unk> <unk> <unk> pages n is both an homage to traditional english forms and a dramatic critique of them
it implies that the <unk> <unk> was rooted in its subjects minds manners and morals and argues tacitly that its self - destructive flaws were embodied in the defensive snobbery willful blindness role - playing and especially the locutions of its domestic servants
as the narrator <unk> the solitary butler of <unk> <unk> mulls over such hallowed terms as greatness dignity service and loyalty we see how pious ca nt subverts the soul
<unk> dutiful conflation of the public and private realms like his beloved master destroys all <unk> it was designed to preserve
such armor crushes the soldier
the mask cuts to the quick
it n the year <unk> the <unk> crisis marked the final end of <unk>
as he stands on a hill at the beginning of a six - day motor expedition from <unk> to <unk> where a former housekeeper resides perhaps the victim of an unhappy n marriage perhaps he hopes with more fervor than he will ever acknowledge not disinclined to return to domestic service <unk> surveys the view and thereby provides a self - portrait a credo and the author metaphor for the aesthetic of the novel n we reading
we call this land of ours <unk> <unk> and there may be those who believe this a somewhat immodest practice
yet i would venture that the landscape of our country alone would justify the use of this lofty adjective
it is the very lack of obvious drama or spectacle that sets the beauty of our land apart
what is pertinent is the calmness of that beauty its sense of restraint
it is as though the land knows of its own beauty of its own greatness and feels no need to shout it
in comparison the sorts of sights offered in such places as <unk> and <unk> though undoubtedly very exciting would i am sure strike the objective viewer as inferior on account of their unseemly demonstrativeness
an effusive landscape
an ill - mannered mountain
but let <unk> continue in his unwitting comic manner his conscious efforts at banter always fail most comically this whole question is very akin to the question that has caused much debate in our profession over the years what is a great butler
his answer is one possessed of a dignity in keeping with his position
such dignity has to do crucially with a butler ability not to abandon the professional being n he inhabits
he will not be shaken out by external events however surprising alarming or vexing
continentals are unable to be butlers because they are as a breed incapable of the emotional restraint which only the english race are capable of
despite his racial advantage to be a great butler is a heroic calling one pantry is not unlike general headquarters during a battle
if for example in the midst of a great social occasion such as an international conference on revising the <unk> <unk> in <unk> one <unk> father himself a great butler once should happen to die of a stroke one must continue to serve the port please do n't think me unduly improper in not ascending to see my father in his deceased condition just at this moment
you see i know n my father would have wished me to carry on just now
it is this kind of dignity and restraint that allows <unk> to declare for all its sad associations whenever i recall that evening today i find <unk> i do so with a large sense of triumph
we note the imperial public word used to deny private rage and sorrow
that <unk> himself is not grotesque or repellent but funny and sad and enlightening is entirely the author triumph
<unk> <unk> ability to create a fallible narrative voice that permits him to explore such intertwining domestic cultural and political themes was abundantly clear in his previous novel an artist of the <unk> <unk> set in <unk> after the war
now shifting his scene from the country n he left at five to the <unk> <unk> he has lived in for nearly n years he has fashioned a novel in the mode of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
with great aplomb he considers not only filial devotion and utterly repressed sexual love but british anti - <unk> the gentry impatience with democracy and support of <unk> and the moral problematics of loyalty it is in practice simply not possible to adopt such a critical attitude towards an employer and at the same time provide good service
this employer embodies all that i find noble and admirable
i will hereafter devote myself to serving him
this is loyalty intelligently bestowed
in the end after meeting with the former housekeeper <unk> sits by the seashore at dusk thinking of her and of his employer and declares i trusted
i trusted in his lordship wisdom
i ca n't even say <unk> i made my own mistakes
really one has to ask oneself what dignity is there in that
the loyal servant has come full circle
what is greatness
what is dignity
we understand <unk> such rueful wisdom must be retrospective the owl of <unk> only spreads her wings at dusk
but as the remains of the day so eloquently demonstrates with quiet virtuosity such wisdom can be movingly embodied in art
<unk> <unk> teaches <unk> and comparative literature at <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> said <unk> its <unk> subsidiary completed the previously announced sale of its air separation plant and related assets in <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the price was n't disclosed
the transaction is part of <unk> continuing program to shed <unk> industrial gas interests and expand the subsidiary propane business
since <unk> <unk> has netted more than n million from industrial gas divestitures and reinvested more than n million to acquire three propane distributors
<unk> is a gas and electric utility and distributes propane nationally through its <unk> subsidiary
<unk> <unk> who represents the soviet airline <unk> here has some visions that are wild even by the current standards of perestroika
in his office overlooking the runway of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> enthusiastically throws out what he calls just ideas
first he suggests <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the international aircraft leasing company based in <unk> could lease some of its <unk> jetliners to the soviet airline
then <unk> <unk> the irish flag carrier could teach <unk> pilots to fly the boeings and the fleet could be based here at <unk> <unk>
that not all he says n
<unk> <unk> the irish airport authority could build a cargo terminal in the <unk> <unk>
<unk> could lease some of its cargo planes to <unk> <unk> through <unk> for a joint - venture cargo airline
and then there is his notion of an irish - soviet charter airline <unk> to ferry armenians to <unk> <unk> via <unk>
have the freedoms of glasnost gone to <unk> <unk> head
hardly
the irish - soviet aviation connection is alive and well here at <unk> <unk>
<unk> is indeed talking about leasing western planes to <unk> and even about buying <unk> - built <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is in discussions with the soviet carrier about a cargo venture and other possibilities
<unk> <unk> already has so many ventures with <unk> that its chief executive is studying russian
unlikely as it may seem tiny politically neutral <unk> has penetrated the mighty soviet airline bureaucracy
and as <unk> struggles to boost its service standards upgrade its fleet and pursue commercial opportunities the irish aviation industry seems poised to benefit
irish and soviet people are similar says <unk> <unk>
they look the same
they very friendly
moreover he says n irish companies are small but spunky
we have to study their experience very well he says
we must find any way n to get business
the two groups have been working together since the late <unk> long before soviet joint ventures were the rage in the <unk>
<unk> carried about n million passengers last year and <unk> <unk> the airline largest transit airport outside the <unk> <unk> saw <unk> <unk> flights and n passengers pass through
an apartment complex down the road is the crew - rest and staging area for more than <unk> <unk> pilots and flight attendants
the airport biggest supplier of aircraft fuel is the <unk> <unk>
tankers from the latvian port of <unk> each year unload n million gallons of fuel into a special tank farm at the airport
what <unk> does n't pour into its own gas - guzzling ilyushins is bartered to the airport authority which resells it to <unk> <unk> carriers including <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> airlines and <unk> <unk> airlines
<unk> thus pays its landing fees ground - handling and catering bills with fuel preserving its hard currency
that is n't all
last year the irish airport authority in a joint venture with <unk> opened four hard - currency duty - free shops at <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> now manages duty - free sales on all <unk> international flights out of <unk>
duty - free shops in <unk> <unk> <unk> opened in <unk> and hard - currency shops in <unk> hotels and on the soviet - finnish frontier are coming soon

thanks to a new air - traffic agreement and the ability of irish travel agents to issue aeroflot tickets tourists here are taking advantage of <unk> reasonable prices to board flights in <unk> for holidays in <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
the round - trip fare to <unk> is <unk> irish punts n
<unk> costs n punts
a formal blessing of sorts was bestowed on this friendship in <unk> when <unk> and <unk> <unk> stopped here for talks with irish <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
new trade accords were signed
it all started with geography
when it opened in <unk> <unk> was the first landfall in <unk> for thirsty airplanes flying from <unk> <unk>
advances in aircraft fuel efficiency over the years made a <unk> stop unnecessary for most western air fleets but <unk> still flies inefficient ilyushins that ca n't make it from <unk> to <unk> on one hop
as a result <unk> did n't spurn the soviets after they shot down a <unk> <unk> <unk> jetliner over the <unk> of <unk> in <unk> though it suspended direct <unk> - <unk> flights for two months
in fact <unk> <unk> started ferrying russians from <unk> to <unk> <unk> when <unk> stripped <unk> of its <unk> landing rights
today <unk> <unk> is making a heap of money from its <unk> friendship
and with those contacts in place it could be relatively simple to add <unk> <unk> and <unk> to the team
then perhaps <unk> <unk> ideas would n't sound like so much blarney
<unk> industrial production rose n in <unk> from <unk> and was up n from <unk> <unk> according to provisional data from the <unk> <unk> <unk>
output in the energy sector which can vary greatly with swings in the oil market rose <unk> in <unk> from <unk> but was down <unk> from a year earlier
the latest figures compare with <unk> n month - to-month rise and <unk> year - to-year fall
when <unk> <unk> begins shipping steel from the world first thin - slab plant this month it will begin testing the competitive mettle of its giant competitors
the new technology which creates a very thin piece of steel radically reduces the costs of making flat - rolled sheets
an ebullient <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman says <unk> the company plant eventually will make a ton of steel in n man hours compared with four to six man hours at a conventional mill
we had the russians and chinese and people from <unk> visiting us <unk> <unk> beams
everyone in the world is watching us very closely
especially his neighbors the major <unk> steelmakers
already <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> are studying <unk> technology to see if they can adopt it
says the chief executive officer of a major <unk> steel company it damn worrisome
the once - staid steel industry is about to be turned topsy - turvy by a n technology revolution
new efficient and sophisticated processes make it easier for smaller less cash - rich companies to make steel at a fraction of what <unk> <unk> paid decades ago
it also enables minimills finally to get a toehold in the flat - rolled steel market the major steelmakers largest most prized and until now untouchable market
but such thin - slab technology is only the beginning
eager engineers espouse direct - steelmaking and direct casting which by the end of the <unk> will enable production without coke ovens and blast furnaces
those massive structures while posing cost and environmental headaches effectively locked out all but deep - pocketed giants from steelmaking
there a revolution ahead of us that will ultimately change the way n we market and distribute steel says <unk> <unk> vice president manufacturing and technology for the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
it is n't that major steelmakers have blithely ignored high technology
in fact they spent billions of dollars to boost the percentage of continously cast steel to <unk> in <unk> from n five years before
moreover their balance sheets are rich with diversity their old plants shuttered and work forces lean
but that wo n't suffice
it no longer enough to beat the guy down the street
you have to beat everyone around the world says <unk> <unk>
he wants to see steelmakers more involved in computers and artificial intelligence
the problem they saddled with huge plants that require costly maintenance
and try plying new dollars free in a market that is softening hurt by a strong dollar and concerned about overcapacity the industry <unk> <unk>
the technology revolution is going to be very threatening to established producers says <unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk>
they got too much invested in the old stuff and they ca n't get their workers to be flexible
no one expects minimills to eclipse major integrated steelmakers who remain the undisputed kings of highest - quality steel used for autos and refrigerators
<unk> plant in <unk> <unk> ultimately will produce only one million tons annually a drop in the <unk> flat - rolled steel bucket and it will be years before such plants can compete in the high - profit market
still flat - rolled is the steel industry bread and butter representing about half of the n million tons of steel expected to be shipped this year
moreover the process is n't without its headaches
because all operations are connected one equipment failure forces a complete plant shutdown
on some days the <unk> plant does n't produce anything
at this point the minimill capacity wo n't make a great dent in the integrated market but it does challenge them to develop new markets says <unk> <unk> vice president materials at <unk> a technology and management - research giant based in <unk> <unk>
indeed with demand for steel not growing fast enough to absorb capacity steelmakers will have to change the way n they do business
in the past says <unk> <unk> chief economist <unk> <unk> steelmakers made a product and set it out on the loading dock
we said we got a product if you want it you can buy it he says adding now we figuring out what people need and are going back to make it
<unk> sales representatives visit the <unk> motors <unk> <unk> assembly plant in <unk> <unk> <unk> two or three days a week
when they determined that <unk> needed parts more quickly <unk> convinced a steel service center to build a processing plant nearby so shipments could be delivered within <unk> minutes
cementing such relationships with major clients car and appliance makers is a means of survival especially when those key clients are relying on a smaller pool of producers and flirting with plastic and aluminum makers
for example when <unk> began talking about plastic - bodied cars the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> began a major lobbying effort to show auto makers how they could use steel more efficiently by simply redesigning how a car door is assembled
but steelmakers must also find new markets
after letting aluminum - makers take the recycling lead a group of the nation largest steelmakers started a recycling institute to promote steel cans to an environmentally conscious nation
<unk> <unk> <unk> thinks n steelmakers should concentrate more on construction
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for example is touting to homeowners fashionable steel doors with leaded glass inserts as a secure and energy - efficient alternative to wooden or aluminum ones
other steelmakers envision steel roofs covering suburbia
still others are looking at overseas markets
<unk> is funneling drilling pipe to steel - hungry <unk> <unk>
this year the nation largest steelmaker reactivated its overseas sales operation
producers also are trying to differentiate by concentrating on higher - profit output such as coated and electrogalvanized products which remain beyond the reach of minimills
almost all capital - improvement programs announced by major steelmakers within the past year involve building electrogalvanizing lines used to produce steel for such products as household appliances and car doors
but unfortunately that segment is much smaller than the bread - and-butter flat - rolled steel
it like everyone climbing out of the <unk> <unk> and getting into a lifeboat says <unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk>
after a while someone has to go over the side
although he does n't expect any bankruptcies he does see more plants being sold or closed
<unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> agrees
unless there is an enormous rate of economic growth or a further drop in the dollar it unlikely that consumption of <unk> produced steel will grow sufficiently to offset the growth of minimills
not to mention the incursion of imports
japanese and european steelmakers which have led the recent technology developments are anxiously awaiting the lifting of trade restraints in <unk>
moreover the <unk> can expect more competition from low - cost producing <unk> <unk> and latin american countries
a taiwanese steelmaker recently announced plans to build a <unk> - like plant
people think of the steel business as an old and mundane smokestack business says <unk> <unk>
they dead wrong

<unk> <unk> patent - infringement damages case against <unk> <unk> <unk> one of the highest stakes corporate trials ever is getting scant attention on <unk> <unk>
after <unk> days of mind - numbing testimony in federal court in <unk> the trial is being all but ignored by analysts and patent attorneys
most have read the pre - trial documents however and estimate <unk> <unk> will be ordered to pay <unk> billion to n billion for infringing on seven <unk> patents
that may be the largest patent award ever but it is well below the <unk> billion <unk> <unk> seeks
the highest patent damage award to date was in <unk> when <unk> <unk> <unk> was ordered to pay n million to <unk> <unk> <unk> for infringing on a patent on an oil drilling bit seal
the two companies later agreed to settle for n million
few analysts think n it is worth their time to slog through the <unk> trial testimony
it like panning for gold outside of <unk> <unk> <unk>
you might find something but the chances are low said <unk> <unk> an analyst at <unk> <unk> <unk>
and <unk> <unk> an analyst at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said if you hired an attorney n to be there all the time and give you a prediction of the eventual award i would be willing to bet that he would be off by a lot
a n trial in the early n determined that <unk> based in <unk> <unk> infringed on patents of <unk> of <unk> <unk>
the main issues remaining are how to calculate damages and whether the infringement was willful and deliberate
if so the damages could be tripled
two analysts who have read the transcripts <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> a litigation analyst at <unk> <unk> <unk> think n <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> will decide in <unk> favor on the willful and deliberate issue
<unk> <unk> said <unk> testimony by <unk> patent counsel <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> showed that he worked with <unk> continuously from the outset of the project in an effort to avoid infringement
<unk> told <unk> on many occasions to avoid various features because of <unk> patent positions and <unk> followed his advice in every instance <unk> <unk> said
but <unk> <unk> a patent expert at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> who is familiar with the case said <unk> the fact that seven patents were infringed suggests <unk> that infringement was willful
it difficult to be that consistently wrong
observers also wonder whether <unk> <unk> will use the lost - profits method of determining damages which <unk> favors because it would result in a larger award or the reasonable royalty method
<unk> claims <unk> it could have manufactured and sold all the instant cameras and film sold by <unk> if <unk> had n't entered the market
moreover <unk> contends n it could have sold them at a higher price and thus made higher profits because it would n't have been forced to match <unk> lower prices
each side has called a <unk> <unk> <unk> professor <unk> to testify on that issue
<unk> hired <unk> <unk> and <unk> brought in <unk> <unk> <unk>
there nothing that says that people at <unk> <unk> school have to agree with each other said <unk> <unk>
testimony is expected to continue until early <unk>
a decision is n't expected until some time next year
<unk> <unk> machines <unk> said <unk> earnings tumbled n in the third quarter even a bit further than expected rendering the outlook doubtful for the next few quarters
the main reason was a delay in shipment of new high - end disk drives a business that accounts for some <unk> of <unk> <unk> billion of annual revenue
<unk> which telegraphed the poor results three weeks ago also cited an increase in its leasing business which tends to lock in business long - term but cut revenue in the near term
in addition <unk> noted that the stronger dollar has cut the value of overseas revenue and earnings when they are translated into dollars
earnings fell to n million or <unk> a share somewhat below securities analysts revised expectations of around <unk> a share
that compared with the year - earlier n billion or <unk> a share which was inflated by a <unk> gain from the sale of some <unk> communications <unk> stock and by an unspecified amount from a payment by <unk> <unk> relating to a software dispute
revenue climbed <unk> to n billion from n billion
<unk> <unk> <unk> remained upbeat
the computer giant whose <unk> results have been dismal for years noted that revenue rose again in the <unk> in the third quarter following an increase in the second period
the company said in a statement that demand for <unk> products and services continues to be good world - wide
we do not see anything in the fundamentals of our business that would cause us to change our strategy of investing for profitable growth
securities analysts however remained downbeat
i think <unk> <unk> will be another mediocre year said <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> actually cut his per - share earnings estimate to <unk> from <unk> for <unk> and to <unk> from <unk> in <unk> because he decided n sales would be even weaker than he had expected
both estimates would mark declines from the <unk> net of <unk> billion or <unk> a share which itself was well below the record <unk> <unk> set in <unk>
<unk> <unk> said n he kept a buy\/hold recommendation on the stock only because all the damage has been done
he said n the stock has n't traded below <unk> <unk> times book value over the past <unk> years which at the moment computes to a stock price of <unk>
the stock closed yesterday at <unk> a share up just n in composite trading on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as the market surged
analysts worry that the disk - drive and leasing problems will last at least through the first quarter
a key part of the question is how soon does this disk - drive come and how soon does production ramp up said <unk> <unk> at <unk> <unk> <unk>
and the input <unk> i had from customers is that it still could be a while
on leasing <unk> <unk> at <unk> <unk> said <unk> he thinks <unk> <unk> has hurt itself unnecessarily
he said <unk> <unk> has priced its leases aggressively thinking n that would help win business
but he said <unk> <unk> would have won the business anyway as a sale to a third party that would have then leased the equipment to the customer
he said <unk> <unk> has not only hurt its short - term revenue outlook but has also been losing money on its leases
<unk> <unk> executive vice president of marketing at <unk> <unk> a huge leasing firm said to put it mildly <unk> <unk> has been doing some of the worst economic deals of any leasing company n we have ever seen
<unk> is expected to get a boost soon when it announces some new versions of its mainframes
but the basic technology in the line is almost five years old which means n it is long in the tooth and competitors are rolling out strong products of their own
<unk> is gaining momentum in the personal - computer market and is expected to introduce some impressive workstations early next year
but it hard to squeeze much profit out of the personal - computer business these days and the workstation market while important is too small to rely on for much growth
the disk drives will doubtless sell well when they finally become available
but the <unk> <unk> highly successful minicomputer line is losing its momentum and some analysts said n sales could even decline in the fourth quarter
in addition <unk> growth in software in the third quarter was just n well below historical levels even when adjusted to reflect last year payment from <unk> and the stronger dollar
and expenses up <unk> in the quarter have stayed stubbornly high
in the nine months <unk> earned <unk> billion or <unk> a share down n from the year - earlier n billion or <unk> a share
revenue increased <unk> to n billion from n billion
<unk> <unk> chairman said <unk> he is more than comfortable with analysts estimates that third - quarter earnings rose to at least n cents to n a share from n cents the year earlier
<unk> <unk> <unk> also chief executive officer of the company indicated that he expects analysts to raise their forecasts for n after the company releases its earnings today
so far analysts have said n they are looking for <unk> to n a share
after today announcement that range could increase to <unk> to n a share
the official said <unk> he also would be comfortable with that new range
in <unk> the soft - drink giant earned <unk> a share
results for n will include about <unk> cents a share from the dilutive effects of snack - food and bottling company acquisitions
in composite trading on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the company closed yesterday at <unk> a share up n
the company said <unk> third - quarter sales are expected to increase n from <unk> billion of last year third quarter
domestic soft - drink bottler case sales are estimated to have risen only n in the third quarter well below the n to <unk> growth of recent years but about in line with the rest of the soft - drink industry
<unk> <unk> blamed the slower volume on rainier weather a dearth of new products in the industry and to a much lesser extent pricing
<unk> said <unk> its soft - drink prices were about n higher in the quarter
<unk> <unk> also noted that soft - drink volume rose a hefty n in last year third quarter making the comparison more difficult
<unk> soft - drink volume was up about <unk>
<unk> - food tonnage increased a strong n in the third quarter while domestic profit increased in double digits <unk> <unk> said <unk>
excluding the british snack - food business acquired in <unk> snack - food international tonnage jumped n with sales strong in <unk> <unk> and <unk>
total snack - food profit rose n
led by <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> restaurant earnings increased about n in the third quarter on a n sales increase
same - store sales for <unk> <unk> rose about n while <unk> <unk> increased <unk> as the chain continues to benefit from its price - value strategy
<unk> <unk> has turned around declining customer counts by permanently lowering the price of its tacos
same store - sales for <unk> <unk> <unk> which has struggled with increased competition in the fast - food chicken market and a lack of new products rose only n
the operation which has been slow to respond to consumers shifting tastes away from fried foods has been developing a grilled - chicken product that may be introduced nationally at the end of next year
the new product has performed well in a market test in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk>
after a four - year <unk> billion acquisition binge that brought a major soft - drink company soda bottlers a fast - food chain and an overseas snack - food giant to <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> he does n't expect any major acquisition in the next year or so
but you never can tell he added you have to take advantage of opportunities
<unk> <unk> chose <unk> <unk> a longtime friend from <unk> to be chairman of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>

<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> its directors declared a dividend of five cents per class a common stock payable <unk> n to stock of record <unk> n
the dividend represents the balance of its regular quarterly payout of <unk> cents a share of which half was paid <unk> <unk> in a final distribution prior to its merger with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> also in <unk>
the company said <unk> it hopes to resume its schedule of regular quarterly dividends at the end of this year
<unk> - <unk> said <unk> it notified <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> n it will cancel a n billion contract to supply electricity to the <unk> utility
the provincially owned utility said n it is tearing up the deal because the contract objectives ca n't be fulfilled
<unk> - <unk> said <unk> <unk> regulators refusal to approve the contract earlier this year halted work on transmission lines and stopped negotiations for resale of electricity carried through <unk> to other utilities
it would now be physically impossible to begin deliveries in <unk> a <unk> - <unk> official said
the contract was to run from <unk> to n
under the contract <unk> - <unk> was to supply <unk> megawatts of power to <unk> <unk> <unk> starting in <unk> <unk> megawatts starting in <unk> and <unk> megawatts starting
<unk> - <unk> said <unk> <unk> regulators refusal to approve the contract means <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has lost its place in line
we wo n't sign any new contracts with deliveries beginning earlier than <unk> the <unk> - <unk> official said
he said <unk> <unk> - <unk> already has some customers in mind for the power that was to be delivered to <unk>
nothing has happened since we signed the contract to undermine our conviction that <unk> - <unk> was the lowest - cost most environmentally acceptable choice for meeting a part of our customers energy needs through the year <unk> said <unk> <unk> senior vice president <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> said n it is evaluating many energy options n to make up for the lost future power including new energy generation and management proposals from <unk> <unk> and possibly new canadian purchases
<unk> options traders were among the big victims of <unk> plunging stock market including one small firm that required an emergency n million bailout
while <unk> rebounding markets helped other investors recoup losses many options customers and professional traders in stock - index options and the options on takeover stocks were left with multimillion - dollar losses traders here and in <unk> <unk> said n
options traders were hurt worse than others on <unk> because of the highly volatile nature of options which often rise or fall in value several times the amount of the price change in the individual stock or index of stocks on which they are based
thus options traders <unk> were stuck with losses that also were several times larger than those suffered by many stock traders in <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said that given the high degree of leverage in the options market it is very easy for these guys to get wiped out
that may just be the nature of these highly leveraged little creatures
an options contract gives the holder the right to buy call or sell put a specific amount of stock or in this case the value of a stock index based on a predetermined price within a given time period
options traders who in return for a small fee or premium had previously sold put options on stocks or stock indexes were forced on <unk> to buy those contracts back at the previously agreed prices which were substantially above those in the market as it was falling
they then had no choice in many cases but to sell the contracts at prevailing prices in most cases at a substantial loss
the latest round of losses is likely to be a serious blow to the <unk> <unk> options <unk> which has never fully recovered from the aftershock of <unk> <unk> when investors fled the market because of huge losses
making matters worse was the fact that late <unk> afternoon the <unk> halted stock - index options trading in step with the <unk> <unk> <unk> halt in stock - index futures
but while the <unk> reopened a half hour later the <unk> remained closed leaving many options traders unable to make trades that might have reduced the losses
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said that unlike the futures market the options exchange has to open in a rotation that allows each different options series to trade
exchange officials reasoned that they would n't have been able to make such a rotation with the time remaining <unk> afternoon and with the stock - index futures on the verge of closing for a second and final time the <unk> reasoned that its best course was to remain closed
the damage was so bad at <unk> <unk> an options trading firm here that it was forced to transfer its accounts to <unk> options of <unk> a unit of <unk> <unk> <unk> as a result of options trading losses
<unk> so far is the only member of a financial exchange n to be forced to be taken over by another firm as a result of <unk> rout
<unk> still had several million dollars in capital left after <unk> close of trading but not enough that regulators worried about another potential market plunge yesterday would let it reopen for trading options exchange officials said n
thus in an unprecedented arrangement underscoring the seriousness of the transfer the <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the options <unk> <unk> as well as the firm owner <unk> <unk> put up a total of n million to guarantee the customer positions being transferred to the bank holding company subsidiary in case the market plunged again yesterday
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> vice chairman of <unk> <unk> <unk> options parent company said <unk> the firm took on about n accounts formerly held by <unk> almost all of them belonging to professional floor traders
<unk> and his firm were still worth a lot of money <unk> <unk> said
a package of credit support was put together including the assets of <unk> and his firm
the bailout was cobbled together over the weekend with officials from the <unk> <unk> <unk> securities and <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> as well as the options exchanges
it was great to have the luxury of time <unk> <unk> said
at one point an options industry official had to talk the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> night watchman into giving him the home phone number of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> president
<unk> options did n't have to put any money into the bailout
yesterday rally in the stock futures and options markets led <unk> and <unk> officials to conclude that the n million in guarantees almost certainly wo n't need to be tapped by <unk> options
the <unk> firm had some losses and liquidity problems during the <unk> <unk> crash as well <unk> <unk> said <unk>
a federal official said that <unk> <unk> worked with securities and banking regulators over the weekend to fashion the <unk> bailout but that conditions were n't dictated by those agencies
it was their business decision the official said
officials at options <unk> <unk> which processes all options trades for <unk> exchanges said that the n million guarantee was unprecedented but was necessary to help insure the integrity of the options markets
it was an extraordinary situation that needed extraordinary steps said <unk> <unk> <unk> president and chief operating officer
<unk> <unk> declined to give the specific contributions to the n million guarantee from each participant
but <unk> and <unk> officials said that options <unk> <unk> contributed n million to the guarantee the <unk> put up n million the <unk> added n million and n million came from <unk> <unk> own assets

on days that i really busy says <unk> <unk> who works in public relations for the company it seems decadent to take time off for a massage
although such sessions may never replace coffee breaks on - site massage as it is known in the trade is certainly infiltrating corporate <unk>
in some companies middle managers sneak massage therapists into the office fearful that upper - level executives wo n't approve
<unk> <unk> indulgence is nothing like the oily hour - long rubfests enjoyed by spa visitors
nor does it at all resemble despite what some executives think the more intimate variety offered at specialty parlors in bad parts of town
on the contrary office rubdowns usually take place in dimly lighted conference rooms where stressed - out employees relax in specially designed chairs fully clothed
the massages last n minutes and typically cost about n
some companies including <unk> even pay part of the fee
<unk> <unk> has been seeing some n clients a visit since the program was started at <unk> last year
<unk> <unk> <unk> the company chairman swears by her firm touch saying n regular massages are a balm for his old football injuries
massage advocates say that kneading the head shoulders neck and back can go a long way toward easing tension and improving morale
they also insist that touching is a basic need as powerful as the need for food or sleep and that the office is as good a place as any n to do it
the blood flows to your head you feel lightheaded and you do n't feel tension around the head or neck says <unk> <unk> an operations supervisor at the <unk> <unk> office in <unk> <unk> <unk> where massages began last month
when you leave the room after your massage people say n you look like you glowing
adds <unk> <unk> the <unk> masseuse who plies her trade in the <unk> rapids office they fall in love with my hands
not everyone however is at ease with office massage
three years ago the <unk> <unk> <unk> office in <unk> <unk> <unk> opened its doors to on - site massage
and even though employees paid the bill taxpayers grumbled
sometimes with the release of stress you hear oohs and ahs coming out of the room explains <unk> <unk> the agency health specialist
and you ca n't have taxpayers coming into an audit hearing oohs and ahs
last month the complaints intensified and the massages ended
now we looking for a room with thicker walls <unk> <unk> says
massage also has an image problem <unk> to contend with
some masseurs have tried to get around this by calling themselves bodyworkers and describing their office visits as reinvigoration breaks
but massage no matter how chaste is still associated in many minds with seedy fronts for prostitution and that makes some executives nervous
last year the research and development division of <unk> <unk> the large wood - products concern invited a masseuse to its <unk> <unk> offices
<unk> <unk> a software engineer was an eager customer
you build up a lot of tension working at a terminal all day he says
but after about eight months the vice president of the division <unk> <unk> learned about the sessions and brought them to a halt
<unk> <unk> says <unk> his only beef was that the massages were being given in a company conference room the department supervised health facility would have been fine
in my view massages should be managed with an appropriate mixture of males and females around he says
given such attitudes some corporate masseurs prefer to go about their business quietly
<unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> says n he has been working for the past year at a huge chemical and manufacturing concern in <unk> <unk> unbeknownst to the company executives

the self - proclaimed father of on - site massage is <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> masseur whose mission is to save the touch - starved masses
to help do this <unk> <unk> developed a portable massage chair three years ago that he hopes <unk> will bring structured touching into mainstream <unk>
the culture is not ready to take off its clothes lie down and be touched for an hour for n he says
the idea is to keep the clothes on and to keep people seated
the chair is a way n to package massage
sitting in one of <unk> <unk> chairs which cost n and have since been copied by others is a bit like straddling a recliner

in what is believed to be the first cancellation of a loan to <unk> since the <unk> n killings in <unk> an international bank syndicate has terminated a n million credit for a <unk> property project
the syndicate led by <unk> <unk> <unk> agreed last <unk> to provide the loan to <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> property developer
but several weeks ago in the wake of the <unk> killings the loan was canceled according to bankers and executives close to the project
<unk> <unk> and <unk> declined to comment on the move
lenders had doubts about the project even before <unk> n but the harsh crackdown which caused many businesses to reassess their <unk> transactions gave the banks the out n they wanted says <unk> an official close to the <unk> venture
the decision to cancel the loan exemplifies the tough attitude n bankers have taken toward <unk> since <unk> <unk>
while some commercial lending has resumed international lenders remain nervous about <unk> economic troubles and foreign debt n billion at the end of <unk>
many loans are being renegotiated especially those tied to the hotel sector which has been hit hard by a post - <unk> n tourism slump

the project known as <unk> <unk> has been mired in controversy
when the loan agreement was announced it was hailed as one of the first western - style financing transactions ever used in <unk>
unlike most loans to <unk> there was no chinese guarantor
instead the banks secured a promise from state - owned <unk> of communications that it would lend <unk> <unk> the entire n million at maturity to finance repayment of the original borrowing
the loan was to have matured in just two to three years as soon as construction was completed
but in a letter sent in <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> the loan was terminated because the developer had failed to deliver adequate financial data and pay certain fees to the loan - management committee on time according to officials close to the project
creditors involved in the project contend however that the termination actually had nothing n to do with these technical violations
instead the creditors say <unk> the loan fell victim to nervousness about <unk> political turmoil as well as to concern about the loan security
the bank syndicate is made up mostly of european banks but it includes <unk> state - owned <unk> <unk> <unk>
the n banks in the syndicate sustained no monetary losses because none of the credit facility had been drawn down
<unk> <unk> <unk> agreed to acquire <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> a share or n million in a move to expand its presence in the rapidly growing warehouse - club business
the proposed merger comes as <unk> <unk> profit is declining and sales at its core discount stores are rising more slowly than at such competitors as <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> based in <unk> <unk> recently said n net income would fall for the third consecutive quarter after a n drop in the first half of its current fiscal year
the membership warehouse - club concept has great potential the company chairman <unk> <unk> <unk> said in a statement
<unk> clubs typically carry general merchandise and food products which they sell for close to wholesale prices in no - frills stores
shoppers many of whom operate small businesses pay annual membership fees which provide an income base for the stores
<unk> <unk> tested the warehouse - club sector last year with its acquisition of a <unk> interest in <unk> <unk>
but the <unk> chain which operates as a joint venture between <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> has only six stores and annual sales that one analyst estimated at about n million
six - year-old pace based in <unk> <unk> operates <unk> warehouse - club stores
the company had losses for several years before turning profitable in fiscal <unk>
in the year ended <unk> <unk> <unk> rang up profit of n million or n cents a share after a tax - loss carry - forward on sales of n billion and analysts expect its results to continue to improve
the company turned the corner fairly recently in profitability said <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> who had been forecasting a n jump in <unk> net income from operations this year and another <unk> increase next year
<unk> productivity is really beginning to take off
but some analysts contend <unk> <unk> <unk> has agreed to pay too much for <unk>
even if you look at it as a turnaround situation it expensive said <unk> <unk> of <unk> - <unk> securities <unk>
in my opinion you would only pay that kind of price if you were getting a premier player in the industry
<unk> <unk> of <unk> raised a more fundamental question about the deal
if <unk> <unk> ca n't get its act together in discounting why is it spending time <unk> worrying about other growing markets
she said i would say <unk> <unk> mart number one job is to address its market - share loss in discount stores which longer - term will lead to improved profit margins
at that point perhaps diversification would be appropriate
but <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is intent on pushing the company into new retail businesses
for instance <unk> <unk> is opening big food and general merchandise stores called hypermarkets and warehouse - type stores specializing in office products and sporting goods
it also operates <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> home improvement stores

traders nervously watching their <unk> electronic - data machines yesterday morning were stunned to see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> plummet n points in seconds
a minute later it soared <unk> points then zoomed back down <unk> points n below <unk> close
it was crazy said <unk> <unk> general partner of <unk> <unk> <unk>
it was like flying without a pilot in the front of the plane
but those who said this ca n't be happening were right
the quotrons were wrong
<unk> systems <unk> a <unk> unit blamed the <unk> foul - up on a timing problem in our software caused by the enormous early volume about n million shares in the first hour of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> trading
the prices of the individual stocks that make up the average were correct <unk> said n but the average was wrong
meanwhile there was an awful lot of confusion
at about n a.m. on the over - the-counter trading desk at a major brokerage firm a veteran trader who buys and sells some of the most active stocks looked at a senior official and asked what going on
is the market up or down
at the time <unk> was reporting that the industrial average was down n points
in fact it was up <unk>
<unk> <unk> a vice president who heads the trading desk at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said that once she figured out <unk> the <unk> numbers were wrong she called brokers to tell them
it been kind of annoying to say the least she said
to confuse matters further when <unk> <unk> stock finally opened on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> at n a.m. the price was listed at <unk> a share up about <unk> from <unk> in fact its true price was <unk> down <unk>
that was the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> blooper
a spokesman cited a technical error and declined to elaborate
and there were other blunders
when the market opened at n a.m. <unk> a reporter for the <unk> newswire miscalculated the industrial average drop as a n decline when it really was down <unk>
it was a case of human error which we found almost immediately and corrected a spokesman for <unk> in <unk> <unk> said
meanwhile some currency traders at west german banks in <unk> said n they sold dollars on the news and had to buy them back later at higher prices
but it was the <unk> problems that had lingering effects
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said in early afternoon that she was still viewing prices and other data as subject to verification and she said n portfolio managers continued to question the numbers n they saw on the screen
it was the second time in less than a week that <unk> has had problems calculating the industrial average
at the start of trading last <unk> the average appeared to plunge more than n points
actually it was down only a few points at the time
<unk> said n that snafu which lasted nine minutes resulted from a failure to adjust for a <unk> stock split at <unk> <unk> <unk>
a <unk> spokeswoman said n recent software changes may have contributed to yesterday problems
she said <unk> <unk> switched to a backup system until the problems were corrected
today of all days she lamented
the eyes of the world were watching us
<unk> <unk> <unk> was named a senior vice president of this graphics equipment company
he retains his current positions as chief strategic officer of <unk> <unk> and president of <unk> ventures
<unk> attorney <unk> <unk> representing a plaintiff in a damage suit says <unk> he has negotiated a settlement that will strike a blow for his client
literally
it turns out <unk> <unk> <unk> client <unk> <unk> of <unk> did n't like the way n defense attorney <unk> <unk> acted during the legal proceedings
so she has agreed to forgo monetary damages against <unk> <unk> client in return for the right to punch the attorney
<unk> <unk> mother also gets to cuff <unk> <unk>
so does <unk> <unk> and his law partner <unk> <unk>
the bizarre arrangement grows out of <unk> <unk> representation of <unk> <unk> <unk> one of several defendants in a wrongful death lawsuit brought by <unk> <unk> the widow of a construction worker killed in <unk> n while working on a new <unk> convention center
last month <unk> <unk> says <unk> <unk> <unk> associate agreed that <unk> would pay <unk> as part of an overall settlement
but <unk> <unk> scuttled the deal at the last minute angering the plaintiff side
i never agreed to it <unk> <unk> says adding that it not necessary to pay these nuisance settlements
when <unk> <unk> and her mother heard about what had happened <unk> <unk> says <unk> they volunteered that they would like to give <unk> <unk> a good walloping
<unk> <unk> says <unk> he passed that along to his adversary and soon they were talking about the ground rules under which <unk> could keep its money and the plaintiffs could take a shot at <unk> <unk>
although time and place have yet to be determined some details are in place
<unk> <unk> says <unk> he agreed to strike <unk> <unk> above the belt
<unk> <unk> and her mother indicated n they want to catch him unawares from behind he says n
<unk> <unk> for his part insisted that the punchers ca n't assign their pummeling rights to anyone else ca n't use a blunt instrument and ca n't take a running start
<unk> <unk> says <unk> he regards the agreement which has n't been submitted to a judge as something of a joke
however he acknowledges n they have the option of taking a swat at me if they really want to
<unk> <unk> says <unk> his side is dead serious
although they do n't contemplate delivering any disabling blows he says that <unk> <unk> will be asked to sign a release from liability just in case
after two years of drought it rained money in the stock - index futures markets yesterday
as financial markets rebounded trading volume in the <unk> <unk> <unk> huge <unk> <unk> <unk> stock - index futures pit soared reaching near - record levels for the first time since <unk> n
the sudden influx of liquidity enabled several traders to reap six - figure windfalls in a matter of minutes as prices soared traders said
guys were minting money in there today said <unk> <unk> a futures broker for <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>
the <unk> <unk> futures contract which moves in fractions of an index point under normal conditions jumped two to three points in seconds early yesterday after an initial downturn then moved strongly higher the rest of the day
each index point represents a n profit for each <unk> <unk> contract held
for the first time since the <unk> crash traders said that they were able to trade several hundred <unk> <unk> contracts at a time in a highly liquid market
many institutions and individual investors have shied away from stock - index futures blaming them for speeding the stock market crash on <unk> <unk> two years ago
since the crash many futures traders have n't assumed large positions for fear that the <unk> <unk> market with much of its customer order flow missing would dry up if prices turned against them
more than n traders jammed the <unk> n futures pit to await the opening bell
traders were shouting bids and offers a full five minutes before the start of trading at <unk>
the contract fell five points at the open to n the maximum opening move allowed under safeguards adopted by the <unk> to stem a market slide
but several traders quickly stepped up and bid for contracts driving prices sharply higher
the market hovered near <unk> closing price of <unk> for about a half hour moving several index points higher or lower in seconds then broke higher and did n't look back
the <unk> <unk> contract that expires in <unk> closed up a record n points on volume of nearly n contracts
traders five feet from each other were making bids and offers that were a full point apart said one s&p n broker
you could buy at the bid and sell at the offer and make a fortune he marveled
several of <unk> <unk> largest securities firms including <unk> brothers <unk> and <unk> <unk> were also large buyers traders said n
<unk> <unk> was among the largest sellers of stock - index futures last week traders said n
brokerage firms as a rule do n't comment on their market activity
unlike the week following <unk> <unk> two years ago individual traders in the <unk> <unk> pit were also being uncharacteristically circumspect about their one - day profits
with the <unk> around here bragging rights are a thing of the past said one trader referring to the federal investigation of futures trading that so far has resulted in <unk> indictments lodged against individuals on the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of <unk>
the market for <unk> billion of high - yield junk bonds regained some of its footing as the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> rebounded from <unk> plunge
but the junk recovery led by the bellwether <unk> holdings bonds was precarious
no trading existed for the vast majority of junk bonds securities industry officials said n
on <unk> trading in practically every issue ground to a halt as potential buyers fled and brokerage firms were unwilling to provide bid and offer prices for most issues
nothing traded on <unk> and people were n't really sure where the market should have opened yesterday said <unk> <unk> <unk> co - head of merchant banking at <unk> <unk> <unk>
but we had a fairly active day yesterday
at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the leading underwriter of junk bonds i was prepared to be in a very bad mood tonight said <unk> <unk> <unk> a junk bond trader
now i feel n maybe there a little bit of euphoria
but before the stock market rebounded from a sharp early sell - off yesterday he said <unk> you could n't buy junk bonds and you could n't give them away
yesterday rally was led by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> bonds which initially tumbled three points or n for each <unk> face amount to <unk> <unk> before rebounding to <unk> <unk>
bonds issued by <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> also showed big gains recovering almost all their losses from <unk> and early yesterday
but traders said <unk> the junk bond market increasingly is separating into a top - tier group in which trades can be executed easily and a larger group of lower - quality bonds in which liquidity or the ability to trade without too much difficulty has steadily deteriorated this year
liquidity has n't returned to the vast middle ground of the market said <unk> <unk> of <unk>
the deadbeats are still deadbeats said <unk> <unk> of <unk>
analysts are concerned that much of the high - yield market will remain treacherous for investors
<unk> <unk> associate professor at the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> citing a pattern of junk - bond default rates that are low in the early years after issuance and rise later says we now in a period where we starting to see defaults from the big issue years of <unk> to n
<unk> <unk> a senior vice president at <unk> <unk> <unk> confirms that there is increasing concern about the future liquidity of the junk bond market
junk bonds are a highly stratified market said <unk> <unk> vice chairman of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
there a whole bunch of stuff that money good and a whole bunch of stuff that not so good
analysts at <unk> <unk> say <unk> junk bond offerings by tightly stretched issuers seem to be growing
almost n billion of junk bonds that are considered untradeable include issues from <unk> <unk> <unk> holdings not related to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> stores <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> holdings <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> communications
you could still have some very bad times ahead said <unk> <unk>
it possible to have a n default rate in one year because we already seeing big problems in the midst of a pretty strong economy
i certainly not comfortable saying n we seen the bottom
but yesterday rally among good junk was a badly needed tonic for the market
many issues bounced off the floor <unk> <unk> said n and benchmark junk issues recovered all of their losses from <unk> and early yesterday
in contrast he says n the stock market gained back only about half what it lost <unk> and the government bond market lost about half what it gained <unk>
traders said <unk> yesterday rally was fueled by insurance companies looking for bargains after a drastic slide in prices the past month
in addition mutual funds did n't appear to be major sellers of high - yield securities as was expected
sometimes a shakeout is healthy said <unk> <unk> <unk>
people will learn to be more circumspect
if they do good credit analysis they will avoid the hand grenades
i think n the market is in good shape
should you really own stocks
that a question n a lot of people are asking following the stock market stunning display of volatility
whipsawed financially and emotionally by <unk> heartstopping n drop in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and yesterday n rebound they wondering if an individual has any business being in the market
the answer say n academic researchers money managers and investment specialists is yes as long as you approach the stock market as an investor
but they say n people should n't try to be traders who buy and sell in an effort to ride the latest economic trend or catch the next hot stock
the case for owning stocks over the long - term is compelling
if you look at n years worth of investment history including the <unk> <unk> and every bear market since stocks have outperformed almost everything n an individual could have owned by a long shot says <unk> <unk> vice president at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
a dollar invested in the stock market in <unk> would have grown to n by the end of last <unk> according to <unk> <unk> managing director at <unk> associates <unk>
but a dollar invested in long - term bonds in <unk> would have grown to only n and a dollar put in <unk> bills would equal a meager n
the longer the time period the less risk n there is of losing money in the stock market
over time the odds increasingly favor the investor with a diversified portfolio
for instance <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> money manager calculates that if an investor holds a basket of stocks that tracks the <unk> <unk> <unk> index the chance of losing money is <unk> to n over a n period compared with n over three years and n over one year
if you do n't need the money for n years there a clear - cut case for sticking to a steady core of stocks <unk> <unk> says
stock - market investments also help balance the other assets n an individual owns says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> president of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> planners
stocks have a place in an investors portfolio along with real estate bonds international securities and cash he says n
there are some important caveats before investing in stocks individuals should have at least three to six months of living expenses set aside in the bank most investment advisers say n
individuals also should focus on building equity in a home which provides some protection against inflation as well as a nest - egg that can be cashed in late in life to help cover the cost of retirement living
people also should n't invest money in stocks that they need in the near future for example for college tuition payments or retirement expenses
you may have to sell your stocks at a time when the market takes a plunge says <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> financial planner
but once the basics are covered then i would start to invest even if it as little as <unk> says <unk> <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> services <unk>
he says <unk> individuals should consider not just stocks but other long - term investments such as high - quality bonds
despite the strong case for stocks however most pros warn that individuals should n't try to profit from short - term developments
it very difficult n to do says <unk> <unk> a market strategist for <unk> <unk> securities a <unk> <unk> brokerage firm
our markets move so fast and they are so volatile n there no way n the average investor can compete with the pros
individual investors face high transaction costs of moving in and out of the market
the cost of executing stock orders varies from brokerage to brokerage and with the size of the order but n of the order value is an average says <unk> <unk> <unk> manager of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> mutual fund
and assuming <unk> their first investment is successful investors will have to pay taxes on their gains
that can reduce returns by a third or more once local taxes are included <unk> <unk> says n
after that individual traders face the risk that the new investment <unk> they choose wo n't perform well so their trading costs could be sustained for nothing
it very tough for most individuals to out - trade the mutual funds or the market says <unk> <unk>
you should really think twice if you think n you can out - smart the system
then too many individual investors lack the sturdy emotional makeup n professionals say <unk> is needed to plunge in and out of the market
so what the best way n to buy stocks
unless an individual has a minimum of between <unk> and <unk> <unk> to invest in stocks he still better off in mutual funds than in individual stocks in terms of getting enough attention from a competent broker says <unk> <unk>
still he adds n i could see owning both given that individuals often have an advantage over big investors in spotting special situations based on their own insights he adds
<unk> <unk> first vice president at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> says that individuals have a particular edge now in small to medium - size niche companies with exciting earnings prospects a traditional stomping ground for small investors
this growth sector which usually carries a price\/earnings multiple about twice that of the <unk> <unk> <unk> happens to include some of the market most attractive bargains right now
it now selling at a multiple about even with the market says <unk> <unk>
moreover <unk> <unk> sees a revival of institutional interest in smaller growth stocks that could boost the performance of these stocks in the medium term
many big <unk> <unk> brokerage firms who eliminated their research effort in stocks of emerging growth companies a few years ago are now resuming coverage of this area he notes n
we seeing a real turnaround in interest in small growth stocks he says
the pros strenuously advise individuals to stay away from the latest investment fad
they say <unk> that especially important this late in the growth phase of the economic cycle when there no robust bull market to bail investors out of their mistakes
<unk> correction presents a pretty good buying opportunity but let not speculate at this point in the business cycle says <unk> <unk> <unk> chief equity portfolio strategist at <unk> <unk> <unk>
buy stocks on weakness for their long - term fundamentals he says
in the long run investment advisers say n most investors will be better off using the dollar - cost averaging method of buying stocks
in this method a person invests a regular amount every month or quarter into the stock market whether the market is up or down
that cuts the risk <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> money manager points out
when the market is low you are buying more shares and when it high you buying fewer shares he says
otherwise if you put all your money in at one time by sheer bad luck you might pick a terrible time and have to wait three years to get even <unk> <unk> says <unk>
a disciplined program will work the best <unk> <unk> says <unk>
one of the hardest things n to do is to buy stocks when the market is down he says
but that just the time when you should be buying them
compound annual returns including price changes and income from interest and
\ * actual performance not

the following issues were recently filed with the securities and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> initial public offering of two million shares of common stock of which <unk> shares are being offered by the company and n shares by holders via <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>

<unk> <unk> who faced rising doubt about his bid for <unk> <unk> parent <unk> <unk> even before a <unk> <unk> buy - out came apart <unk> withdrew his n billion offer
separately bankers representing the group trying to buy <unk> parent <unk> <unk> met with other banks about reviving that purchase at a lower price possibly around <unk> a share or n billion
but a lower bid could face rejection by the <unk> board
<unk> <unk> who vowed <unk> to go forward with the bid said <unk> he was dropping it in light of the recent change in market conditions
he said <unk> he might now sell his <unk> stake buy more shares or make another offer at a lower price
the <unk> real - estate developer acted after the <unk> buyers failed to obtain financing for their earlier n bid which sparked a selling panic among that snowballed into a n drop <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
news about <unk> and <unk> whose shares never reopened after trading was halted <unk> for the <unk> announcement sent both stocks nosediving in composite trading on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> tumbled <unk> to <unk> on volume of n million shares and <unk> declined by <unk> to <unk> as n million shares changed hands
together the two stocks wreaked havoc among takeover stock traders and caused a n drop in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> second in size only to the stock - market crash of <unk> n <unk>
some said <unk> <unk> market debacle had given <unk> <unk> an excuse to bail out of an offer that showed signs of stalling even before problems emerged with the <unk> deal
after reaching an intraday high of n the day <unk> <unk> <unk> disclosed his bid <unk> <unk> <unk> stock had retreated as low as n last week
some takeover stock traders had been betting against <unk> <unk> because he has a record of disclosing stakes in companies that are potential takeover targets then selling at a profit without making a bid
he still has n't proven his mettle as a big - league take - out artist said airline analyst <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>
he done this thing where he buy a little bit of a company and then trade out of it
he written this book the art of the <unk>
why does n't he just follow through on one of these things
<unk> <unk> withdrew his bid before the <unk> board which is due to meet tomorrow ever formally considered it
<unk> had weighed a wide range of possible responses from flat rejection to recapitalizations and leveraged buy - outs that might have included either employees a friendlier buyer such as <unk> billionaire <unk> <unk> or both
<unk> had also sought to foil <unk> <unk> in <unk> by lobbying for legislation that would have bolstered the authority of the <unk> <unk> to reject airline buy - outs
yesterday <unk> <unk> tried to put the blame for the collapse of the <unk> deal on <unk> saying n it was rushing through a bill to protect <unk> executives
i believe that the perception that legislation in this area may be hastily approved contributed to the collapse of the <unk> transaction and the resulting disruption in the financial markets experienced this past <unk> <unk> <unk> wrote members of <unk>
<unk> declined to comment and <unk> <unk> did n't respond to requests for interviews
<unk> <unk> never said how much <unk> stock he had bought only that his holdings were substantial
however he only received federal clearance to buy more than n million of the stock on <unk> n when the price rose <unk> a share to n
between then and his bid on <unk> n the price fluctuated between <unk> and <unk>
in an attempt to persuade investors that his bid was n't just a stock play <unk> <unk> promised last week to notify the market before selling any shares
<unk> was trading at around <unk> yesterday before his withdrawal announcement then immediately fell to about <unk>
assuming that he paid a rough average price of <unk> a share and assuming n he did n't sell before his announcement reached the market <unk> <unk> could be sitting with a modest loss with the stock at <unk>
some analysts said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> might seize the opportunity presented by the stock price drop to protect the nation largest airline with a defensive transaction such as the sale of stock to a friendly holder or company employees
however other knowledgeable observers said n they believed <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> board might well decide to tough it out without taking any extra steps
some analysts said n they believed <unk> <unk> <unk> whose towering ego had been viewed by some as a reason to believe n he would n't back out might come back with a lower bid
<unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> is stepping back and waiting for the dust to settle
i sure n he still wants <unk>
but others remained skeptical
i was never sure <unk> <unk> <unk> really wanted to take <unk> said <unk> <unk> a bond analyst with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
what happened with <unk> was a gracious way for him to bow out
<unk> <unk> never obtained financing for his bid
that skepticism would leave him with an even greater credibility problem should he return that would handicap him in any effort to oust the board in a proxy fight
meanwhile <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> the two lead lenders on the <unk> buy - out met with other banks yesterday to determine if they would be willing to finance the buy - out at a lower price
officials familiar with the talks said <unk> <unk> had discussed lowering the offer to <unk> a share but said n that price was a talking point and that no decision has been made
at <unk> a share the group would have to borrow about n billion from banks
the first <unk> deal unraveled after <unk> and <unk> could n't raise n billion
<unk> and <unk> had agreed to commit n billion and said n they were highly confident of raising another <unk> billion
together <unk> and <unk> received n million in fees to raise the rest of the financing
but other banks balked at the low interest rate and banking fees n the <unk> group was willing to pay them
officials familiar with the bank talks said <unk> the <unk> buy - out group <unk> pilots management and <unk> <unk> <unk> is now willing to pay higher bank fees and interest but is n't likely to boost its n million equity contribution
nor is the group likely to come forward with a revised offer within the next n hours despite the hopes of many traders
the group advisers want to make certain n they have firm bank commitments the second time around
even if the buy - out group is able to obtain financing the transaction still faces obstacles
<unk> board could reject the new price as too low especially since there are n't any competing bids
<unk> <unk> investor <unk> <unk> whose <unk> offer was rejected by <unk> board has n't shown signs of pursuing a <unk> back - up bid n he made last month
in addition the coalition of labor and management longtime enemies who joined forces only under the threat of <unk> <unk> bid could break apart now
the group resilience gets its first test today when <unk> top pilot union leaders convene outside <unk> in a previously scheduled meeting
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> faces the tough task of explaining why banks refused to finance a buy - out n the members approved overwhelmingly last week
the pilot union is vowing to pursue an acquisition whatever the board decides
but if the board rejects a reduced bid and decides to explore other alternatives it could transform what has been a harmonious process into an adversarial one
the pilots could play hardball by noting <unk> they are crucial to any sale or restructuring because they can refuse to fly the airplanes
if they were to insist on a low bid of say n a share the board might n't be able to obtain a higher offer from other bidders because banks might hesitate to finance a transaction n the pilots oppose
also because <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other <unk> executives have joined the pilots bid the board might be forced to exclude him from its deliberations in order to be fair to other bidders
that could cost him the chance to influence the outcome and perhaps join the winning bidder
influential members of the <unk> ways and means <unk> introduced legislation that would restrict how the new savings - and-loan bailout agency can raise capital creating another potential obstacle to the government sale of sick thrifts
the bill whose backers include <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> would prevent the <unk> <unk> <unk> from raising temporary working capital by having an <unk> - owned bank or thrift issue debt that would n't be counted on the federal budget
the bill intends to restrict the <unk> to <unk> borrowings only unless the agency receives specific congressional authorization
such agency self - help borrowing is unauthorized and expensive far more expensive than direct <unk> borrowing said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the bill chief sponsor
the complex financing plan in the s&l bailout law includes raising n billion from debt issued by the newly created <unk>
this financing system was created in the new law in order to keep the bailout spending from swelling the budget deficit
another n billion would be raised through <unk> bonds which pay lower interest rates
but the <unk> also requires working capital <unk> to maintain the bad assets of thrifts that are sold until the assets can be sold separately
that debt would be paid off as the assets are sold leaving the total spending for the bailout at <unk> billion or n billion including interest over n years
it a problem that clearly has to be resolved said <unk> <unk> executive director of the <unk>
the agency has already spent roughly <unk> billion selling <unk> insolvent s&ls and it is likely to sell or merge <unk> by the time n the bailout concludes
absent other working capital he said n the <unk> would be forced to delay other thrift resolutions until cash could be raised by selling the bad assets
we would have to wait until we have collected on those assets before we can move forward he said
the complicated language in the huge new law has muddied the fight
the law does allow the <unk> to borrow from the <unk> up to n billion at any time
moreover it says <unk> the <unk> total obligations may not exceed n billion but that figure is derived after including notes and other debt and subtracting from it the market value of the assets <unk> the <unk> holds
but <unk> did n't anticipate or intend more public debt say <unk> opponents of the <unk> working - capital plan and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> has been remiss in not keeping <unk> informed
that secrecy leads to a proposal like the one from ways and means which seems to me sort of draconian he said
the <unk> is going to have to pay a price of prior consultation on the <unk> if they want that kind of flexibility
the ways and means <unk> will hold a hearing on the bill next <unk>
we about to see if advertising works
hard on the heels of <unk> <unk> stock - market plunge and the uncertainty that followed a few big brokerage firms are rolling out new ads trumpeting a familiar message <unk> on investing the market just fine
their mission is to keep clients from fleeing the market as individual investors did in droves after the crash in
just days after the <unk> crash major brokerage firms rushed out ads to calm investors
this time around they moving even faster
<unk> <unk> filmed a new television commercial at n p.m. <unk> yesterday and had it on the air by last night
<unk> investments placed new ads in newspapers yesterday and wrote another new ad appearing today
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by yesterday afternoon had already written new tv ads
it considered running them during tomorrow night <unk> <unk> broadcast but decided not to when the market recovered yesterday
other brokerage firms including <unk> <unk> <unk> were plotting out potential new ad strategies
the brokerage firms learned a lesson the last time around when frightened investors flooded the phone lines and fled the market in a panic
this time the firms were ready
<unk> for example prepared ads several months ago in case of a market plunge
when the market went into its free fall <unk> afternoon the investment firm ordered full pages in the <unk> editions of half a dozen newspapers
the ads touted <unk> automated <unk> beneath the huge headline <unk> is ready for your call
a <unk> spokesman says n the n which already was operating but which many clients did n't know about received about double the usual volume of calls over the weekend
a lot of investor confidence comes from the fact that they can speak to us he says
to maintain that dialogue is absolutely crucial
it would have been too late n to think about on <unk>
we had to think about it ahead of time
today <unk> ad goes a step further encouraging investors to stay in the market or even to plunge in with <unk>
underneath the headline diversification it counsels based on the events of the past week all investors need to know n their portfolios are balanced to help protect them against the market volatility
it goes on to plug a few diversified <unk> funds by name
<unk> also was able to gear up quickly thanks to the <unk> crash
in the aftermath of the <unk> debacle the brokerage firm began taping commercials in - house ultimately getting its timing down fast enough to tape a commercial after the market closed and rush it on the air that night
it also negotiated an arrangement with <unk> <unk> <unk> under which <unk> would agree to air its last - minute creations
the new <unk> commercial created with ad agency <unk> <unk> <unk> features <unk> <unk> one of the firm most visible investment strategists sounding particularly bullish
taped just as the market closed yesterday it offers <unk> <unk> advising we view the market here as going through a relatively normal cycle
we continue to feel that the stock market is still the place <unk> to be for long - term appreciation
the spot was scheduled to appear three times on <unk> last night
<unk> considered an even harder sell recommending specific stocks
instead it settled on just urging the clients who are its lifeline to keep that money in the market
we saying n the worst thing that anyone can do is to see the market go down and dump everything which just drives the prices down further says <unk> <unk> <unk> director of advertising
if you owned it and liked it <unk> the true value has n't changed
he adds this is n't n revisited
with the market fluctuating and then closing up more than <unk> points yesterday investment firms had to constantly revise their approach
at <unk> <unk> executives created potential new commercials <unk> night and throughout the weekend then had to regroup yesterday afternoon
the plan had been to make one of <unk> easy - to-film black - and-white where we stand commercials which have been running occasionally in response to news events since n
the ad would have run during the <unk> <unk> tomorrow replacing the debut commercial of <unk> new ad campaign <unk> by <unk>
but in a meeting after the market closed yesterday <unk> executives decided not to go ahead with the stock - market ad
we do n't think at this point <unk> anything needs to be said
the market seems to be straightening out we taking a wait - and-see attitude says <unk> <unk> <unk> executive vice president of marketing
in any case the brokerage firms are clearly moving faster to create new ads than they did in the fall of n
but it remains to be seen whether their ads will be any more effective
in <unk> despite a barrage of ads from most of the major investment firms individuals ran from the market en masse
now the firms must try their hardest to prove that advertising can work this time around
ad notes

the supplement the largest ever for the magazine includes ads from n corporate advertisers and kicks off a two - year <unk> <unk> initiative on education
the magazine will distribute n of the gross revenues from the supplement as grants to innovative teachers
you know what the law of averages is do n't you
it what <unk> explains why we are like well ourselves rather than <unk> <unk> <unk> cautions that it possible to drown in a lake that averages two feet deep and <unk> predicts that <unk> monkeys placed before <unk> pianos would produce n publishable rock roll tunes
baseball that game of the long haul is the quintessential sport of the mean and the mean ol ' law caught up with the <unk> <unk> giants in the <unk> <unk> last weekend
the team that dumped runs by the bushel on the <unk> cubs in the <unk> <unk> playoffs was held to just one in two games by the home - team <unk> <unk> the gang that had been done unto similarly by the <unk> <unk> dodgers and <unk> <unk> in last year tournament
morever much of the damage was accomplished by a who had some catching up n to do
in game two on a cool <unk> evening in this land of perpetual autumn a lot of the catching up was done by the <unk> catcher <unk> <unk>
he hit a <unk> pitch from <unk> <unk> into the left - field stands in inning four to stretch his team lead from <unk> to a decisive n where it stayed
so what if <unk> had struck just seven home runs in <unk> regular - season games and batted in the seventh position of the <unk> lineup
if you get your pitch and take a good swing anything can happen he later remarked
on <unk> night quite a few of the boys in green and gold salted away successes to salve the pain of past and no doubt future droughts
<unk> <unk> the big red - haired <unk> first baseman had three hits in four at bats two more than he had in the five - game <unk> series in which he gone n
the <unk> - men batting <unk> . n through n a.k.a . the bottom of the order got seven of their team n hits and scored four of its runs in a <unk> decision
right - hander <unk> <unk> held the giants to five hits to account for the zero on the other side of the <unk> ledger
that he was the <unk> winningest pitcher during its <unk> <unk> campaign with a <unk> mark plus two wins over <unk> in the playoffs indicates n he may have some evening up coming but with the way n his split - fingered fastball is behaving that might not be this week
the same goes for <unk> <unk> another veteran who overcame early struggles to permit the giants but a run and four hits in seven innings in <unk> contest
every guy n they put out there had a better split - finger than the guy before marveled giant manager <unk> <unk>
he an ex - hurler who one of the leading gurus of the fashionable delivery which looks like a fastball until it dives beneath the lunging bat
the upshot of the downshoot is that the <unk> go into <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> tonight up two games to none in the best - of-seven fest
the stat n to reckon with here says that about three of four clubs n of n that took <unk> <unk> leads went on to win it all
that not an average n to soothe <unk> rooters
one might think that the home fans in this <unk> of the <unk> called <unk> that a better name for a public conveyance than <unk> do n't you think would have been ecstatic over the proceedings but they observe them in relative calm
partisans of the two combatants sat side by side in the <unk> seats of <unk> <unk> and while they cheered their favorites and booed the opposition hostilities advanced no further at least as far as i could see
a few folks even showed up wearing caps bearing the colors and emblems of both teams
i for the giants today but only because they lost yesterday
i love both
the only thing n i rooting for is for the <unk> to go seven games said <unk> <unk> a <unk> septuagenarian at the <unk> before <unk> go
the above represents a triumph of either apathy or civility
i choose to believe n it the latter although it probably springs from the fact that just about everyone out here including the a and giants is originally from somewhere else
suffice it to say that if this were a <unk> <unk> yankees - mets series or one between the <unk> cubs and <unk> sox hey it possible you need uniformed police in every other seat to separate opposing fans and only the suicidal would bifurcate their bonnets
anyway the <unk> gave you a lot of heroes n to root for
in the opening game besides <unk> and <unk> there was <unk> <unk> a twiggy - looking second - year shortstop who had lost a couple months of the season to knee surgery
he was flawless afield ditto in game two moved a runner along in the <unk> three - run second inning and homered for his team final tally
such is his reputation among the <unk> <unk> <unk> that when he hit his first career home run last season the fan who caught it agreed to turn the ball over to him in return for an autograph
not his autograph power - hitter <unk>
an <unk> co - hero of the second game was <unk> <unk> who exemplifies the hot side of the hot - cold equation
he smoked <unk> in the playoffs with six hits seven walks and eight stolen bases in <unk> at bats and continued that by going n at the plate <unk> along with walking stealing a base and scoring a run
when you in the groove you see every ball tremendously he lectured
the cold guys in the set were <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> hitters
they combined for n hits six home runs and n runs batted in in the five games against the cubs
they went a collective n here with zero homers and ribbies
it that last set of numbers as much as anything else that gives the giants hope in the <unk> games <unk> to come
i believe in the law of averages declared <unk> <unk> batting coach <unk> <unk> after game two
i rather see a so - so hitter who hot come up for the other side than a good hitter who cold
but the old <unk> slugger wisely offered no prediction about when good times would return to his side
when it goes you never know when you get it back he said
that baseball
<unk> <unk> reported a n drop in third - quarter net income citing intense competition that caused its gross profit margins to dip
net income for the quarter fell to n million from n million roughly what analysts had expected
but per - share profit dropped only <unk> to n a share from <unk> a share as the company continued its stock buy - back plan
average shares outstanding dropped to n million from n million
revenue fell <unk> to n billion from n billion
the computer maker which sells more than half its goods outside the <unk> also said n the negative effect of a stronger <unk> dollar will adversely affect its fourth - quarter performance and make it difficult to better <unk> results
<unk> said <unk> revenue declined both in the <unk> and overseas reflecting a world - wide softening of the computer markets
the company however said <unk> orders in the <unk> showed good gains during the latest quarter
analysts estimate those gains at n to n a good part of it coming from large orders placed by a few of <unk> major customers
in addition to a general slowing of the computer industry <unk> which sells automated teller machines and computerized cash registers is also affected by the retail and financial sectors areas of the economy that have generally not been robust notes n <unk> <unk> <unk> an analyst for <unk> <unk> <unk>
these factors combined with a strong dollar should negatively affect the current quarter results <unk> said n
in the year - earlier fourth quarter <unk> had profit of n million or <unk> a share on revenue of <unk> billion
<unk> <unk> said <unk> he lowered his full - year estimates for <unk> to n a share from <unk> a share
revenue projections were slashed to n billion from n billion
last year <unk> had net income of n million or <unk> a share on n billion in revenue
for the nine months the company earnings fell <unk> to n million or <unk> a share from n million or <unk> a share
revenues declined n to n billion from n billion
in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> composite trading yesterday <unk> shares fell n cents to close at <unk>
concerning your <unk> n article <unk> <unk> firms <unk> analysts <unk> to <unk> i delighted that <unk> <unk> is finally tuning in to the hard cold facts of the real working world
if the firms are serious however why limit the practice to the poor maligned analysts whose ability to see into the future is fragile at best
why not extend the same harsh standards to the sales force and pay brokers a base salary with annual bonus based on how much money they made for their clients during the year
that should stop a lot of account - churning and produce a stock market driven only by professional concern careful thought and good sense
now would n't that be a novelty
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> trader reported for work at n a.m. two and a half hours before the usual <unk> morning strategy meeting
at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> did n't reach the office until n a.m. but then he had been up most of the night at home
i had calls all night long from the <unk> he said
i was woken up every hour <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
people are looking for possible opportunities to buy but nobody wants to stick their chin out
for many of <unk> securities traders it was a day that started nervously in the small hours
by lunchtime the selling was at near - panic fever
but as the day ended in a frantic <unk> <unk> - inspired rally the <unk> breathed a sigh of relief
so it went yesterday in the trading rooms of <unk> financial district
in the wake of <unk> <unk> plunge last <unk> the <unk> market was considered especially vulnerable
and before the opening of trading here yesterday all eyes were on early trading in <unk> for a clue as to how widespread the fallout might be
by the time n trading officially got under way at n a.m. the news from <unk> was in
and it left mixed signals for <unk>
<unk> stocks closed off a significant but less - than-alarming n on thin volume <unk> <unk> stocks declined n in orderly trading
at <unk> trading room on <unk> <unk> a stately circle at the edge of the financial district desktop computer screens displayed the <unk> market major barometer the <unk> <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
red figures on the screens indicated falling stocks blue figures rising stocks
right away the reds outnumbered the blues <unk> to <unk> as the index opened at <unk> off <unk> points or n
i see concern but i do n't see any panic said <unk> <unk> a big good - humored <unk> <unk> native who runs the n office
the <unk> office a branch of the <unk> <unk> - based firm played it conservatively seeking to avoid risk
this is not the sort of market n to have a big position in said <unk> <unk> who heads trading in all non - <unk> stocks
we tend to run a very tight book
<unk> spent most of its energies in the morning trying to match buyers and sellers and there were n't many buyers
all the takeover stocks scottish <unk> <unk> <unk> are getting pretty well pasted this morning <unk> <unk> said
seconds later a <unk> sell order for <unk> <unk> came in
for the third time in <unk> minutes a trader next to <unk> <unk> left the no - smoking area to have a cigarette
on the screens only two forlorn blue figures remained but the index had recovered a few points and was off about <unk>
because <unk> did n't collapse let pick up a little stock <unk> <unk> said
he targeted <unk> shares of <unk> and punched a button to call up on his screen other dealers price quotes
the vivid yellow figures showed the best price at <unk> pence n and <unk> <unk> traders started putting out feelers
but the market sensed a serious buyer on a day dominated by selling and the quotes immediately jumped to <unk> pence
when i want to buy they run from you they keep changing their prices <unk> <unk> said
it very frustrating
he temporarily abandoned his search for the <unk> shares
by this time it was n a.m. in <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> fielded a call from a <unk> <unk> customer wanting an opinion on the british stock market which had been having troubles of its own even before <unk> <unk> <unk> market break
fundamentally dangerous <unk> <unk> said almost in a whisper fundamentally weak fairly vulnerable still extremely dangerously poised
we in for a lot of turbulence
he was right
by midday the <unk> market was in full retreat
it falling like a stone said <unk> <unk> a pit trader who was standing outside the <unk> <unk> <unk> futures <unk>
only half the usual lunchtime crowd gathered at the tony <unk> <unk> wine bar on <unk> <unk> <unk> nearby
conversation was subdued as most patrons watched the latest market statistics on television
at n p.m. the index hit its low n off n points
<unk> opened the limit down off at least n if you could calculate the index which you could n't <unk> <unk> the <unk> trader said early in the afternoon
<unk> is down n and suspended <unk> down <unk> <unk> <unk>
this market has been very badly damaged
as n p.m. <unk> <unk> opening time neared <unk> traders and salesmen traded bets on how low the <unk> <unk> market would open
in the center of the trading floor chief trader <unk> <unk> and two colleagues scrambled for the telephones as soon as the <unk> <unk> market opened plummeting more than n points in the first few minutes
they saw an opportunity created by the sell - off
as <unk> <unk> traders dumped american <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and trader <unk> <unk> bought them to resell in the <unk>
investors here still expect <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> motors <unk> to bid for <unk>
suddenly after about n minutes the <unk> markets rallied
the <unk> has gone better shouted one trader at about n <unk> time as the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> contract suddenly indicated a turnabout
as <unk> <unk> strengthened the <unk> trading room went wild
traders shouted as their screens posted an ever - narrowing loss on <unk> <unk>
then nine minutes later <unk> <unk> suddenly rebounded to a gain on the day
<unk> <unk> rally shouted <unk> trader <unk> <unk> selling more <unk> shares
this is panic buying
as the <unk> market rallied some wondered whether the weekend of worrying and jitters had been worth it
the <unk> index closed at <unk> its high for the day off <unk> or about <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> statement <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> if you have a million people working for you every bad thing that has one chance in a million of going wrong will go wrong at least once a year is a pretty negative way of looking at things
is n't it just as fair to say that if you have a million people working for you every good thing that has one chance in a million of going right will go right at least once a year
do n't be such a pessimist <unk> <unk>

the <unk> <unk> <unk> approved a bill that would give the transportation secretary authority to review and approve leveraged buy - outs of major <unk> airlines
the collapsed plan to acquire <unk> <unk> parent of <unk> <unk> spurred quick action on the legislation introduced <unk> and approved by the subcommittee on a voice vote yesterday
the bill is expected to be taken up by the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> tomorrow and a floor vote by next week will be urged
the measure drew criticism from the <unk> administration and a parting shot from financier <unk> <unk> who yesterday withdrew his takeover bid for <unk> <unk> the parent of <unk> airlines
in a letter to subcommittee <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> criticized the bill as an explicit effort to thwart his bid for <unk> and said <unk> it contributed to the collapse of the deal
<unk> <unk> deputy transportation secretary also sent a letter n to express the administration opposition to the bill in its present form
<unk> <unk> brushed off <unk> <unk> allegations as an excuse for his own deal failing
he also said n the fact that the other letter had n't come from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> indicated n there is wiggle room in the administration position
<unk> <unk> and other committee members repeatedly stressed that the legislation was n't a response to any particular market situation
but they cited the <unk> and <unk> examples as reasons to move quickly to enact this legislation
aides both in the <unk> and <unk> said <unk> the withdrawal of the <unk> bid for <unk> is n't likely to deflate efforts to push the legislation
it still on the fast track and we still want to do it said one <unk> aide
the bill is aimed at addressing the concern that an airline might sacrifice costly safety measures to pay off the debt incurred in a leveraged buy - out
currently the transportation secretary does n't have clearly established authority to block mergers but can take the drastic step of revoking the operating certificate of any carrier n the official considers unfit
supporters of the legislation view the bill as an effort to add stability and certainty to the airline - acquisition process and to preserve the safety and fitness of the industry
in general the bill would give the <unk> <unk> a <unk> review period before n or more of the voting stock of a major <unk> air carrier could be acquired
it also would require the acquiring party to notify the transportation secretary and to provide all information relevant to determining the intent of the acquisition
the bill would allow the secretary to reject a buy - out if sufficient information has n't been provided or if the buy - out is likely to weaken the carrier financially result in a substantial reduction in size of the airline through disposal of assets or give control to a foreign interest
if more information is needed the secretary would have authority to extend the review period n days
all the witnesses both congressmen and industry experts expressed support for the bill in order to prevent profiteers from cashing in on airline profits at the expense of safe cost - effective service
but several committee members disapproved some backing <unk> <unk> claim that the threat of regulation caused the failure of the <unk> deal and the stock - market plunge
one of the major concerns expressed by the dissenters was that large airlines would be prohibited from divesting themselves of smaller entities and producing independent spin - off companies
in a possible prelude to the resumption of talks between <unk> <unk> and striking machinists union members a federal mediator said n representatives of the two sides will meet with him tomorrow
it could be a long meeting or it could be a short one said <unk> <unk> the mediator who called the agreement to meet a first step toward a resumption of negotiations
we encouraged that talks are scheduled again but beyond that we have made no expression of expectations a <unk> spokesman said
the machinists union has rejected a three - year contract offer that would have provided a n wage increase over the life of the pact plus some bonuses
currently average pay for machinists is n an hour <unk> said n
now in its <unk> day the strike has idled about <unk> machinists and has started to delay delivery of some jetliners
with a strike fund of about n million the union had said <unk> it was prepared for a long strike
after the third week on strike union members will begin receiving n a week from the fund
work at <unk> continues with supervisors and other non - striking personnel manning the lines
and at the company <unk> <unk> plant about <unk> of the <unk> machinists still are working <unk> said n
under <unk> right - to-work laws contracts can not require workers to be union members
<unk> has declined to say how many employees are working at its giant <unk> <unk> plant
<unk> officials could n't be reached for comment
<unk> <unk> partners a hostile suitor for <unk> <unk> said <unk> it intends to launch a tender offer for the computer printer maker common stock
<unk> a group led by the <unk> <unk> investment firm <unk> <unk> also said n it plans to file preliminary materials with the securities and <unk> <unk> regarding a shareholder solicitation to oust <unk> board
<unk> holds a <unk> stake in <unk> and made a n bid for the company in <unk> but <unk> management considered the n million proposal unacceptable
a <unk> spokesman declined to elaborate on the group new plan
in <unk> <unk> <unk> composite trading yesterday <unk> shares jumped n cents to close at <unk>
dataproducts which had been seeking a buyer for several months announced a restructuring plan in <unk> and took itself off the auction block
the company restructuring includes plans to split into three sectors to phase out domestic printer manufacturing operations and to sell its <unk> <unk> subsidiary
as part of the plan <unk> announced a pact to sell n million of its real estate holdings to <unk> <unk> <unk> a unit of <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> president chairman and chief executive officer said n the company is at a loss to understand <unk> intentions
he called today announcement opportunistic and disruptive and said <unk> the company intends to proceed with its restructuring
share prices plummeted across <unk> yesterday in response to <unk> <unk> <unk> sell - off but some issues staged a late comeback after <unk> <unk> opened without another rout
european investors have further reason for optimism today after the <unk> rebound
the <unk> <unk> <unk> which closed before the <unk> <unk> exchanges opened was the hardest hit of the major european markets with the <unk> <unk> dropping <unk>
in <unk> prices plummeted in early trading and were off as much as n before coming back strong after the <unk> <unk> opening to close down only n
west german <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said in my view the stock market will stabilize relatively quickly
there may be one or other psychological or technical reactions but they are n't based on fundamentals
the economy of <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> is highly stable
<unk> which has been the center of speculation fever in recent weeks also was hard hit
share prices fell in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
prices in <unk> where a computer breakdown disrupted trading also tumbled
following is a breakdown of major market activity
frankfurt
one of the sharpest declines came in the financial center of <unk> strongest economy
the <unk> <unk> of <unk> west german blue chips plunged n a one - day record wiping out the summer gains
the index closed at <unk> down n points
by comparison two years ago on <unk> <unk> the new index would have dropped n according to a projection by the exchange
investors may have reacted so strongly to <unk> <unk> stock market loss because they had vivid memories of the <unk> exchange losing <unk> of its value in the <unk> crash and its wake
this time however many small investors may have been hurt by acting so swiftly
they all went in the wrong direction said <unk> <unk> an investment adviser for the <unk> in <unk> <unk> branch
he said <unk> he told clients to buy selected west german blue chips after they fell by about <unk>
after the opening was delayed <unk> minutes because of the crush of sell orders <unk> normal two - hour trading session was extended <unk> minutes to handle the heavy volume
the beginning was chaotic said <unk> <unk> a broker for <unk> <unk>
it took three - quarters of an hour before enough prices could be worked out to get a reading on the market
institutional investors and bankers many of whom spent the night before in their offices watching far eastern markets were cautiously optimistic after the mild <unk> decline in <unk> stock prices
everybody was still confident including most institutional investors
that is why everybody was a little surprised by the storm of sell orders from small private investors said <unk> <unk> a senior trader for <unk> <unk>
some big institutions including banks began picking up lower - priced shares late yesterday but most investors wanted to see what would happen in <unk> <unk> before acting
but even if <unk> <unk> continues to stabilize analysts here say n the latest blow to investor confidence could inhibit a swift recovery for the <unk> exchange which already was showing signs of weakness after the <unk> had slipped from a <unk> high of n on <unk> n
some of <unk> <unk> bluest chips took some of the biggest hits
a n drop for <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> decline were especially problematic for their respective boards whose plans for major rights issues in <unk> could now be in jeopardy
<unk> <unk> last month said <unk> it hoped to raise n billion marks n million by issuing four million shares at n marks each
yet yesterday market cropped <unk> share price by <unk> marks to n marks a share leaving little incentive for investors to subscribe to the standing price unless the market recovers quickly
<unk>
headed toward a record drop at midday the <unk> stock market recouped two - thirds of its losses in the wake of <unk> <unk> early rally
the <unk> <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> closed off n points at <unk> its high for the day after having plunged n points at n p.m
it was big institutions such as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> managers and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that spearheaded the rally
attracted by low prices and encouraged by <unk> <unk> performance they scooped up equities across the board
volume was n million shares more than triple recent levels
paris
late buying gave the <unk> <unk> a parachute after its free fall early in the day
the <unk> <unk> <unk> ended down n at <unk> a drop of <unk> points from <unk>
there was a volatility in the market that i have never seen before said <unk> <unk> a partner in brokerage firm <unk> <unk>
when <unk> <unk> turned around shortly after the opening there was panic buying in <unk>
brokers said that as the news spread that <unk> <unk> was moving up traders who had called to place sell orders changed their line in mid - conversation ordering buys instead
trading was driven primarily by small investors and speculators with large institutions waiting on the sidelines until late in the day
when <unk> <unk> turned however the big boys entered the market looking for bargains
<unk> <unk> <unk> swung to a loss in the third quarter while <unk> <unk> reported <unk> net income more than doubled and <unk> <unk> <unk> net rose n
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> as expected posted a n billion net loss for the quarter reflecting the <unk> <unk> bank decision last month to add n billion to reserves for losses on loans to less - developed countries
the reserve addition placed the parent of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> among a few major <unk> banks that have covered nearly all their medium and long - term portfolios to less - developed countries with reserves
the latest quarter loss equals n a share
in the year - earlier quarter <unk> earned n million or <unk> a share
<unk> <unk> <unk> analyst at <unk> - <unk> securities <unk> called the results mildly disappointing
excluding the n billion provision and allowing for the taxes n <unk> paid earnings were about n cents a share <unk> <unk> said <unk>
in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> composite trading yesterday <unk> climbed n a share to n
net interest income sank n in the quarter to n million from n million
the interest rate on short - term funds which banks borrow to finance longer - term loans to customers was sharply higher <unk> said n
<unk> received n million of interest payments on its medium and long - term brazilian loans had they been accruing interest net interest income would have been n million higher in the quarter <unk> said n
such loans to <unk> also remain classified as non - accruing costing the bank n million of interest income in the third period
income from sources other than interest climbed <unk> to n million reflecting higher corporate - finance and other fees and gains on sales of investment securities
these increases were partly offset by lower trading - related income the bank said <unk>
<unk> - interest expenses grew <unk> to n million
<unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> net income more than doubled in the period largely because of continued strong performance by the bank <unk> operations
the <unk> <unk> company said <unk> earnings rose to n million or <unk> a share from n million or n cents a share a year earlier
the latest quarter included a gain of <unk> million or n cents a share related to the purchase of the remaining n of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the strong performance however contrasted with an unexpectedly large increase in the size of <unk> problem loans particularly in the <unk>
in the third quarter nonperforming assets jumped to n million or n of net loans and leases from n million or <unk> in the second quarter
nonperformers totaled n million or <unk> in the year - ago third quarter
included in the increase in the most recent quarter is a n million loan which <unk> said <unk> it expects to be fully repaid with no loss early in the fourth quarter
the deterioration in credit quality offset strong loan growth of <unk> in <unk> <unk> operations as well as a n growth in deposits resulting from an aggressive marketing campaign
the higher rates paid on deposits also helped squeeze <unk> net interest margin in the <unk> to <unk> from <unk> a year earlier
in <unk> <unk> composite trading yesterday <unk> jumped <unk> a share to n
results were released after the market closed
<unk> <unk> <unk> formed from the remnants of of the failed <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> contributed n million to <unk> bottom line in the third quarter
<unk> said <unk> its third - quarter results reflect <unk> of earnings of the <unk> operation since <unk> n
<unk> raised some n billion in new capital during the quarter to complete the <unk> <unk> purchase and to acquire several small failed thrifts to fill out its regional franchise
last week the banking company said n it purchased both <unk> savings <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> for n million
in the first nine months ncnb net income climbed <unk> to n million or <unk> a share from n million or <unk> a share a year earlier
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> earnings growth slowed in the third quarter but the <unk> <unk> bank holding company was still able to post a <unk> increase in net income because of robust growth in residential real - estate and consumer loans
net rose to n million or <unk> a share from n million or <unk> a share a year earlier
the company said <unk> the gain resulted mainly from a n million increase in net interest income reflecting a n increase in real estate loans mainly residential and a <unk> rise in consumer loans
these high - yielding loans in effect replaced some low - yielding assets such as inter - bank loans which were allowed to decrease
as a result <unk> <unk> net interest margin fell only n basis points a more mild decrease than some major banks outside <unk> which have been reporting more sluggish earnings
<unk> <unk> shares closed at <unk> down n cents in <unk> <unk> composite trading
the earnings represent a n return on assets for <unk> <unk> and an n return on equity
the loan growth offset continuing real - estate loan losses in the depressed <unk> market

the new offer which seeks n of the cellular and broadcasting concern is for <unk> a share for n million <unk> shares
<unk> revised tender offer would require <unk> to begin an auction process in <unk> <unk> that would buy out remaining holders at a per - share price roughly equivalent to what a third party might then have to pay for all of <unk>
<unk> is asking <unk> to clarify its tender offer which challenges an agreement between <unk> <unk> and <unk> to merge their cellular - telephone businesses
<unk> has notified <unk> that it would shortly respond to the <unk> proposal in as full and effective a manner as is warranted
the <unk> board said <unk> holders may be misled by the provision in the <unk> proposal that guarantees private market value after five years for the remaining shares
<unk> has no obligation to purchase and the definition of private market value is uncertain the <unk> board said n
the board added that <unk> would be able to control <unk> operations and could therefore operate <unk> in a manner which could diminish its private market value and attractiveness to a third - party purchaser in five years

<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said n the first dispute - settlement panel set up under the u.s.-canadian free trade agreement has ruled that <unk> restrictions on exports of <unk> salmon and herring violate the accord

if a solution is n't reached by then she said the <unk> would have the right to suspend some trade concessions to <unk> equivalent in value to the losses suffered by <unk> fish - processing companies in <unk> and the <unk> <unk>
however in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> the dispute - settlement panel accepted the legitimacy of <unk> position on the use of these landing requirements to conserve and manage these important fisheries
questioned about the seeming contradiction in the <unk> and canadian government views of the panel report an aide for <unk> <unk> said <unk> the panel had clearly ruled that the canadian trade restrictions are illegal
the <unk> trade representative declined to put a dollar estimate on the losses resulting from the canadian export restrictions
<unk> initially had an export prohibition that was replaced by regulations requiring that such fish had to be brought ashore in <unk> <unk> by commercial fishermen prior to export
this action was defended by the canadian government on conservation grounds
<unk> <unk> said yesterday that the dispute - settlement panel rejected this canadian government argument
we fully expect that <unk> will comply with the panel ruling that the landing requirement also must be ended she said n
earlier an international panel set up under the rules of the <unk> <unk> on tariffs and <unk> in <unk> determined that the original canadian fish - export restrictions violated <unk> rules
<unk> <unk> said <unk> the <unk> wo n't accept any delays after <unk> n because <unk> fish - processing firms enter into contracts in the fall to purchase the next season catch
she said n the canadian restrictions must be removed before such contracts are concluded

the company said n it can redeem the warrants at its option for <unk> each
the offer is n't contingent on a certain amount of debt or stock being exchanged
<unk> said n it is making the offer to shrink its capital and increase shareholder value

the market upheaval apparently has n't triggered any cash crunch yet
individual investors investment firms and arbitragers who speculate in the stocks of takeover candidates can suffer liquidity and payment problems when stocks dive those investors often borrow heavily to buy their holdings and use the stocks as collateral for loans
but several large banks said yesterday n they detected no signs of unusual demand for credit that would signal such difficulties
we seeing nothing out of the ordinary said one official at a <unk> <unk> bank
that good news because we all swim in this water
added another executive at a big bank we were all a little goosey over the weekend trying to forecast what would happen <unk> but it been very quiet
now as for tomorrow hell who knows
what happened <unk> shows that financial markets are not yet sufficiently coordinated to handle another meltdown in prices
no fiddling with systems and procedures will ever prevent markets from suffering a panic wave of selling
but markets can operate with greater or lesser efficiency
after the n plunge markets agreed that it would be wise to halt trading whenever panic conditions arose
the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> adopted two specific circuit breakers if the <unk> <unk> index falls <unk> points in a day the exchange will halt trading for one hour if the decline hits <unk> points the exchange will close for an additional two hours
the rationale is that an interruption of trading will allow investors to reconsider their strategies calm sellers and lead buyers to enter the market at indicated new price levels
it is impossible to know whether that theory is realistic
a temporary cessation of trading may indeed discourage a selling panic from feeding on itself
but there is also the possibility that shutting down markets will intensify fears and cause an even more abrupt slide in prices
what happened <unk> was the worst of all worlds
the futures exchanges followed their own pre - set circuit breakers and shut down at about n p.m. for <unk> minutes after the <unk> <unk> <unk> stock index had fallen <unk> points or about n points on the <unk> <unk> index
options markets stopped trading in many securities
the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> under its own rules remained open
with nowhere else <unk> to go sellers and particularly program traders focused all their selling on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
as liquidity on that market weakened prices fell sharply
had the futures and options markets been open additional liquidity would have been provided and the decline most probably would have been less intense
at n after intense telephone negotiations between the trading markets and <unk> the futures exchanges reopened
futures trading however was halted altogether at <unk> after the futures markets had dropped an additional <unk> points which is the daily limit for price declines
at this point the options markets also shut down and once more left all sales to be handled by the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
it is time n to recognize that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the futures markets and the options markets though physically separate have actually become so closely intertwined as to constitute one market effectively
traders can vary their strategies and execute their orders in any one of them
it therefore makes no sense for each market to adopt different circuit breakers
to achieve maximum liquidity and minimize price volatility either all markets should be open to trading or none
synchronized circuit breakers would not have halted the slide in prices on <unk> but they probably would have made for smoother less volatile executions
it time for the exchanges and the securities and <unk> <unk> to agree on joint conditions for halting trading or staying open
let not have one market shut down for <unk> minutes when the <unk> declines <unk> points and another shut down for an hour after a n decline
the need for hurried last - minute telephone negotiations among market officials will disappear once rules are in place that synchronize circuit breakers in all markets
the new circuit breakers if they are to be applied at all will require that futures and options trading continue as long as the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> remains open
the rules should be established by agreement of the officials of all affected exchanges acting under the oversight and with the approval of the government regulatory agencies
should the <unk> and the commodities futures <unk> <unk> which with the <unk> regulates the <unk> stock - index markets be unable to agree the issue may have to be resolved by decision of the <unk> secretary
in many ways our financial markets are better prepared today to handle a decline than they were two years ago
the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> now has the capacity to handle a volume of nearly a billion shares a day
telephone service has been improved for customers trying to reach their brokers and specialists who i believe n should stay despite the urgings of some post - crash critics have larger capital positions
of course specialists actions alone can never prevent a major crack in stock prices
witness the fact that trading in some stocks closed early <unk> and opened late <unk> because of an excess of sell orders

<unk> <unk> <unk> executive vice president argues that the <unk> faces a multifaceted housing crisis reduced affordability of homes for first - time buyers increased homelessness and lower apartment construction rates that will be very difficult to solve without expanded federal resources
there nothing unusual about business groups pushing for more government spending
but the <unk> was created in <unk> out of an organization that made its name fighting a <unk> administration proposal to take over all defense housing production
through the years the association has been an active member of the taxpayer coalition pushing for such initiatives as the balanced - budget amendment
yet on matters close to er home
the <unk> budget has dropped by more than <unk> since <unk> argues <unk> <unk>
we taken more than our fair share
i would n't have a problem if other programs had taken a similar hit
but <unk> support for subsidies is not related to the current housing crunch over the years the <unk> has backed a host of public programs
it once pushed for a national housing production goal set by the federal government and has regularly advanced anti - recession housing measures
moreover explains one <unk> official the <unk> remains susceptible to internal pressure from members that specialize in subsidized production
the association is pushing an extensive and expensive wish - list which would substantially boost spending above the current level of more than n billion annually
it would like to peg the ceiling on <unk> <unk> <unk> mortgage guarantees to <unk> of the median price in a particular market instead of limiting it to <unk> reduce or even eliminate <unk> down - payment requirements and increase the availability of variable - rate mortgages expand the veterans affairs <unk> loan guarantee program provide adequate funding for the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> increase federal funding and tax incentives for the construction of low - income and rental housing including n billion in block grants to states and localities and fully fund the <unk> <unk> a n million potpourri for the homeless
direct federal subsidies for housing construction have proved intolerably expensive in the past and inevitably are twisted to the benefit of well - connected developers and lobbyists as demonstrated by the ongoing <unk> scandal or congressmen
indirect subsidies through the <unk> for instance are little better
though <unk> <unk> says <unk> expanding <unk> lending would result in no cost to the government the mere diversion of funds from other parts of the economy and from other forms of housing such as low - income to the single - family home market would result in a major expense
more important housing programs run by <unk> the <unk> and <unk> are awash in red ink
the <unk> alone lost n billion in fiscal <unk> the government equity in the agency essentially its reserve fund fell to minus <unk> billion
the federal government has had to pump in n billion into the <unk> housing program since <unk> to keep the fund afloat and the <unk> requested an additional n million for the fiscal year just ended
all told the federal government already guarantees more than n billion of mortgages
in its nicely produced publication where will our children live the <unk> does acknowledge that of course the full measure of housing affordability can not be provided by the federal government
it points to the pernicious impact of local government regulation particularly zoning and building fees which pushes the price of housing out of the reach of low- and middle - income people
but while the <unk> has suggested actions that states and localities should take to reduce regulatory barriers the association has proposed no activist legislative program comparable to say its detailed request for more federal subsidies <unk> to eliminate counterproductive controls
the association a majority of whose n members build fewer than <unk> units a year is like many other business lobbies
explains <unk> <unk> of the <unk> taxpayers <unk> it treads in two worlds
the builders like the subsidies but at the same time they tend to be fiscal conservatives in terms of major issues such as the balanced - budget amendment
unfortunately the organization desire for pork tends to override its commitment to overall fiscal responsibility
two years ago when the <unk> lobbied for the <unk> billion omnibus housing bill the organization basically dropped out of the taxpayers coalition says <unk> <unk> <unk>
as <unk> <unk> of the <unk> acknowledges <unk> is not going to solve the problem
the real key is to have the economy working and interest rates down
more money for <unk> will increase the deficit and destabilize the economy more money to municipalities that are wrecking their local housing markets will further insulate them from the destructive effects of their policies
is this what the home builders want

the only strong opposition to changing the <unk> treaty comes from british <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who is opposed to creating a single <unk> currency
but the process of convening the intergovernmental conference does n't require unanimity
setting a date <unk> to start treaty negotiations has no legal significance in itself but could be viewed as an important psychological push

the latest crewcut in the equities markets reminds me of the joke <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> tells about the guy who was run over by the parade
when asked what went wrong the unfortunate victim replied it was a combination of things
and so it was on <unk> <unk>
the grand marshal of this parade would appear to have been excess leverage
even if that is so however it probably the case that no barriers should have been erected to stop the procession before the end of the rout e
the ceremonies began <unk> afternoon when word spread that the <unk> buy - out was collapsing
although the union - bidder expects to patch together a substitute offer consisting of less cash the failure to get cash from japanese and american banks confirmed a growing fear among arbitragers that the pageant of high - leverage takeover deals is ending
lots of other entries made up the parade of course notably a surprisingly large increase in producer prices signalling <unk> <unk> tightness and the <unk> administration temporary defeat in trying to lower the capital - gains tax
as usual few favorable reviews were heard for that ever - present marching band of program traders although most serious studies suggest n they only play the music that others write
what really spooked the crowds along <unk> <unk> however was the sudden concern that whatever the reason the pool of debt capital is drying up
<unk> <unk> reflects a panic mainly by the takeover arbitragers rather than the small investor as their highly margined investments in the deal stocks are jeopardized by the unexpected drying up of the lubricant for deal financing
deal stocks led the market down as they absorbed the heaviest losses
<unk> which triggered the slide opened <unk> at <unk> down about n from <unk> close
<unk> opened <unk> at n down nearly n from <unk> close
both took further hits yesterday
<unk> lost n on <unk> <unk> lost almost n
a careful look reveals that where deal financing has been secured the target stock price was not affected on <unk>
the multibillion - dollar prospects where the bidder must line up a consortium of banks and\/or issue billions in high - yield debt were where the damage was concentrated
the market for so - called junk bonds has been setting the stage for <unk> dramatic march for several weeks
the growing financial difficulties of recent high - leverage restructurings or takeovers such as <unk> <unk> <unk> resources and <unk> retailing empire have cast a pall over the entire market for high - yield securities
investors have reacted by ignoring recent efforts to float junk bonds by <unk> <unk> and by forcing <unk> to postpone indefinitely its planned junk - bond sale and restructuring
as a result high - yield mutual funds have declined across the board and the many firms planning to sell n billion in junk bonds before year - end are experiencing anxious times
these are all market excesses putting aside the artificial boosts that the tax code gives to debt over equity and what we seen is the market reining them in
of course <unk> had n't been silent in the days leading up to the debacle and its tendency to meddle in the leverage equation remains a troublesome prospect but those preliminary steps should n't distract us from the basic market fundamentalism that was at work on <unk>
if it is correct to find that concerns over corporate debt and lbos caused <unk> <unk> what are the implications for policy makers
after all the stock market response to the collapse of the <unk> deal might be taken to confirm the anti - debt direction of regulators
is this a case where private markets are approving of <unk> bashing of <unk> <unk>
absolutely not
to the extent that <unk> sell - off reflected a sudden reappraisal of the excesses of leverage the message is that <unk> <unk> and the private markets are fully capable of imposing the appropriate incentives and sanctions on corporate behavior
the national economic interests are much better served allowing the private interests of bankers and investors be the ultimate judges of the investment quality of various lbo deals and leveraged restructurings
the recent difficulties in the junk - bond markets and the scarcity of bank capital for recent deals underscores the wisdom of letting the free markets operate
if takeover premiums become excessive if lbo dealmakers become too aggressive then the private market will recognize these problems more quickly and accurately than will policy makers and the markets will move with lightning speed to impose appropriate sanctions
yes the broader exchanges got caught up in the spiral but they rode the tiger up all year
not surprisingly he sometimes bites
the arbitragers and takeover initiatiors got killed on <unk> <unk> while the besieged managers of prospective targets cheered lustily
if you identify with the besieged managers you must concede that speedy and effective relief from the excesses of the takeover market is more likely to come from the marketplace than from <unk>
if you side with the arbitragers and raiders you clearly have more to fear from private investors than from regulators although the <unk> courts should never be underestimated
the truth is <unk> understands politics better than economics
although the average citizen is probably not harmed too much from <unk> rhetorical war against <unk> <unk> regarding excessive financial leveraging actual legislation would probably impose considerable harm
any such attempt to distinguish good debt from bad debt or to draw the line at a particular industry such as the airlines is likely to blunt the spur that the proper amount of leverage provides both to equity markets and economic efficiency in general
far better for policy makers to concentrate on the war against drugs <unk> and the deficit all of them parades that seem never to end
<unk> <unk> former top economist at the securities and <unk> <unk> teaches at the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> share prices rebounded <unk> morning with the <unk> index of <unk> selected stocks rising <unk> points to close the morning session at n
the index slid <unk> points or n on <unk>
in the first n minutes of <unk> trading the <unk> index soared <unk> points to <unk>
by <unk> <unk> <unk> time the index was up <unk> points to <unk> as investors hailed <unk> <unk> overnight rally
<unk> slide came in a relatively calm session that did n't provide much direction for other markets
shares also closed sharply lower across <unk> particularly in <unk> although <unk> and a few other markets recovered some ground after stocks began to rebound in <unk> <unk>
other asian and pacific markets had sharper losses than <unk> but the selling wave stopped short of precipitating another market crash
all eyes were on <unk> at the opening because it was the first major market n to trade since <unk> <unk> plunge on <unk> <unk>
but rather than set the tone for other markets <unk> major institutional investors chose to remain on the sidelines
still despite the sudden reappearance of stock - market turbulence managers of japanese investment funds said n they were n't planning to unload <unk> or european equities
we did n't trade much today as our policy now is to wait and see said a fund manager at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
we would like to wait and see until trading goes around through <unk> and <unk> <unk>
the institutions appeared confident that japanese regulators would step in to ensure orderly trading if necessary and there was considerable speculation during the day that the <unk> <unk> was working behind the scenes to do just that
but in the absence of panicky trading its presence was never overtly felt
at the close the <unk> average of <unk> stocks stood at <unk> down <unk> points or n
the broader <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> sank <unk> or <unk> to n
the day decline was generally in line with analysts weekend predictions
declining issues swamped advancers n
but volume was thin at n million shares compared with n million <unk>
the market opened sharply lower with the <unk> average down nearly n after n minutes
a midmorning rebound brought it back to show a gain of about <unk> at the end of the morning session but the rally failed in the afternoon and the market closed near the day low
the smaller stocks in the <unk> market second section also posted their biggest decline of the year
the <unk> <unk> <unk> index for the second section fell <unk> or <unk> to n
many investors trying to outperform the market major indexes have flocked to these small issues in recent weeks
japanese investors and traders expressed relief that the <unk> market did n't fall more sharply
but its performance did bear some resemblance to events of two years ago during the <unk> <unk> global stock market crash
on <unk> n <unk> the <unk> before the <unk> <unk> crash the <unk> <unk> market dropped <unk> and <unk> followed on <unk> with a n drop
this time <unk> <unk> plunge of <unk> <unk> was followed by yesterday n loss in <unk>
two years ago <unk> biggest fall came the day after <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> plunge when the <unk> average fell n
thus market participants yesterday were looking ahead nervously to <unk> <unk> opening
but in <unk> <unk> yesterday the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> surged n to close at <unk> on heavy volume of <unk> shares although declining issues still outnumbered advancing ones on the broad market
<unk> <unk> a director at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> called yesterday session a good scenario for <unk>
now we are looking for the time n to place buy orders he said
for us institutional investors the chance for buying has come
<unk> <unk> general manager of the investment research department at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> also was optimistic
he described <unk> plunge in the <unk> as a fleeting event resulting in part from excessive merger and acquisition activity
unless there is a panic this is the best time n to buy as was the case two years ago he said
those shares which had posted gains on <unk> speculation were dashed with cold water but as far as major stocks are concerned there is n't much impact
other fund managers were similarly sanguine
we have no plans to adjust our asset allocation in foreign equities said <unk> <unk> chief portfolio manager in the pension fund management department at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
he said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> decline was well within the range of volatility that <unk> <unk> plans for when it charts its overseas investment strategy
among other asian and pacific markets <unk> and <unk> had the biggest losses with the <unk> <unk> composite index in <unk> falling <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> down <unk>
major indexes declined more than <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> in <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> escaped with slightly smaller losses
brokers and fund managers said n the region markets were reacting to <unk> <unk> <unk> plunge even though that decline was due to local factors such as failed corporate buy - outs and a deteriorating junk - bond market
it pure psychology said <unk> <unk> <unk> an account executive for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
markets in this region are n't so geared to leveraged buy - outs and their economies generally are in good shape but there no doubt that <unk> is still following <unk> lead
several analysts said <unk> <unk> and <unk> had the biggest losses because they are relatively open to rapid cash flows
<unk> <unk> is the region next most open market but many foreign investors have been staying away from it since it plunged in <unk> amid political turmoil in <unk>
<unk> took the hit because when people want to get out they tend to go where the liquidity is said <unk> <unk> a regional analyst with <unk> securities <unk> <unk> <unk>
she pointed out that even after <unk> <unk> decline the straits <unk> index is up <unk> this year so investors who bailed out generally did so profitably
similarly <unk> <unk> composite index yesterday ended n above its <unk> close
in <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> fell <unk> to finish at <unk>
trading was heavy at about one billion shares compared with n million <unk>
but the session was orderly in contrast to the market four - day closure after the <unk> crash
<unk> <unk> - <unk> a director at <unk> <unk> - based <unk> <unk> <unk> managers <unk> said n the market probably has n't hit bottom yet but is close
if <unk> <unk> does n't collapse i see maybe another n on the downside not counting the risk of bad news out of <unk> he said
in <unk> <unk> all ordinaries index closed at <unk> down <unk> its biggest drop since <unk> n
but volume rose only to n million shares from n million <unk>
<unk> <unk> an analyst at brokerage firm <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> described the market performance as sheep - like as investors fled to bluechip australian stocks and shunned entrepreneurial companies n they perceived as having any takeover premium built into the price
<unk> <unk> <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> index the most closely watched market barometer ended at its intraday high of <unk> down <unk> or <unk>
at its low shortly before <unk> <unk> opened it was off more than n points
the <unk> <unk> <unk> index closed <unk> points lower at n
volume more than doubled to n million shares from n million <unk>
prices on the <unk> <unk> <unk> tumbled in heavy trading
the decline in the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> points or <unk> to <unk> was the <unk> market steepest fall ever
retail investors dumped holdings on a massive scale pushing some blue - chip shares down as much as <unk>
analysts cited memories of two years ago when many small investors held on to their shares after the <unk> crash but the west german market continued to decline steeply for the next three months
here are price trends on the world major stock markets as calculated by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
to make them directly comparable each index is based on the close of <unk> equaling n
the percentage change is since year - end
<unk> <unk> <unk> is reported to have said once that if you tipped the world on its side everything loose would end up in <unk>
we always thought that <unk> <unk> underestimated <unk> vitality but maybe the state la - la factions are starting to overwhelm the forces that made it such a significant place
what else is one to make of the whacky save - the-earth initiative just proposed by several major environmental groups and organized by the state attorney general
if passed by the voters the recently announced initiative would phase out major pesticides reduce carbon dioxide emissions by <unk> ban new offshore drilling ban chemicals thought to deplete the ozone layer and create a new state environmental officer armed with a n million budget n to sue any firm or agency n he thinks <unk> is being too dirty
the initiative is based largely on the wish - lists of the green lobby the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> voters the <unk> resources <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the citizens for a <unk> <unk>
interestingly the <unk> <unk> <unk> is having nothing n to do with this one
not only californians but all americans would pay if this thing passed
the initiative bars the sale of any crops in <unk> that do n't meet the initiative standards
<unk> wheat farmers and <unk> fruit growers would have to adjust or give up the <unk> market
in other words <unk> is presuming to take control of the nation farm policy
as usual the green lobby proposal is disconnected from scientific reality
consider the greenhouse - effect provision
the proposed initiative would mandate a reduction of carbon dioxide of <unk>
even if one buys into the whole greenhouse theory it is inconceivable that reductions in a single state could have any impact on what is billed as a global problem
but if rational science and economics have nothing n to do with the new environment initiative what is going on
the first place <unk> to look under these circumstances is at the ways in which the sponsors themselves will benefit
the key here is the ambition of state <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
he running for governor
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is the one who collected the plans from the various radical environmental groups and cobbled them into a single unwieldy initiative n to be placed on the ballot for election on <unk> n <unk>
that also the day of the gubernatorial election
the initiative seems to have been crafted to include all the hot issues that set off the wealthy <unk> weepers who donate money
and it allows <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to get around campaign spending limits
he can spend the legal maximum for his campaign all the spending for the <unk> <unk> <unk> initiative on which there are no limits is gravy
this initiative is being labeled the <unk> <unk> but maybe it should be called the <unk> <unk>
the republican candidate <unk> <unk> <unk> is playing the initiative fundraising game too sponsoring his own crime initiative
while it is possible that the <unk> <unk> initiative will be ruled unconstitutional it is of course conceivable that in modern <unk> it could slide through
this is the state that recently passed the <unk> . n anti - toxic initiative
if this new proposal ever does become law the green lobby will benefit directly
the initiative creates a free floating state environmental officer <unk> to sue companies or government agencies that do things n he does n't like
that means <unk> the <unk> and such groups no longer would have to spend as much money on litigation taxpayers would bear the cost
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and his allies may be hoping that the environment is such a mom and apple - pie issue among certain segments of <unk> population now that almost any collection of anti - scientific anti - pocketbook nonsense can pass under its rubric
of course the state liberals are not yet a nation unto themselves
<unk> <unk> for example may decide that he does n't want to be the <unk> who lost control of interstate commerce to an attorney general from <unk>
and some other segments of <unk> political and media culture may yet start to point out that the initiative would impose significant costs on the state less affluent citizens in the form of higher food prices and lost jobs
this grandiose initiative will help <unk> define itself for the future either as a state still tethered to economic and scientific reality or as one being led to wherever its <unk> - la activists want to take it
first there was a death watch
then exhilaration
spurred by waves of large - scale buying in blue - chip stocks the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> rallied yesterday and erased about a half of <unk> <unk> plunge gaining n to n
it was the fourth - biggest advance for the average of <unk> blue chips on frenetic <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> volume of n shares the highest since the days after the <unk> crash
while the advance cheered investors who feared n a <unk> crash would occur yesterday it was strictly a big - stock rally fed by huge buying by bargain - hunting institutions and program traders
a troubling sign declining stocks on the <unk> <unk> outnumbered advancers <unk> to <unk> and the over - the-counter market that includes many smaller stocks suffered aftershocks of <unk> late <unk> <unk> plunge
the <unk> <unk> index closed down <unk> to n
meanwhile in a divergence in two of the market most important indicators the <unk> industrials sister average the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> tumbled <unk> to n its second - worst decline next to the <unk> fall during the <unk> crash
<unk> plunged on takeover disappointments in two airline stocks <unk> and <unk> which each fell more than <unk> when they reopened for trading yesterday after being suspended <unk> afternoon
<unk> the takeover stock at the center of <unk> <unk> market plunge fell <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> on nearly n million shares
overall this is a pleasant rally but it very selective said n <unk> <unk> <unk> a veteran <unk> <unk> trader at the <unk> <unk>
everyone was a little concerned about the general narrowness of the rally and failure of the <unk> market to get into plus territory
it just a strange feeling
i do n't think <unk> anyone left the place whistling <unk>
the rally gave credence at least for now to the pre - trading declaration of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> market debacle was an abnormal condition and not a disaster
but to traders it looked like disaster on the n a.m. opening bell
the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> opened down n shortly after n
but most of the <unk> blue - chip stocks in the average including <unk> <unk> and <unk> motors could n't trade because of the heavy backlog of sell orders left over from <unk> late - afternoon rout
at <unk> <unk> <unk> one of the most important <unk> bellwethers of late opened down <unk> <unk> to n
the <unk> dropped to a quick <unk> loss and to many traders it looked as if stocks were headed for yet another big tumble
more stocks opened over the ensuing half hour as the <unk> <unk> <unk> specialist firms in charge of keeping the market orderly groped to find buy orders from major brokerage firms n to match the selling flood
then to make matters worse computerized sell programs kicked in hammering stocks into steeper losses
there was heavy stock - index arbitrage as traders sold big baskets of stock and bought stock - index futures to profit from the price discrepancies between the two markets
this was a hangover from <unk> when <unk> <unk> <unk> index futures had closed at a sharp discount to stocks
the onslaught of the program selling dashed any hopes that some of the big program trading firms would hold off until the market stabilized
they did n't
the <unk> accelerated its slide losing n in the first n minutes of trading
with program traders seemingly in charge buyers backed away from the market and watched stocks fall
then at <unk> the <unk> suddenly started to rebound and when it shot upward it did so even faster than the early - morning fall
and this time it was n't just the program traders who were responsible
all the selling had pushed stocks to such cheap values that big investment banks and major money management firms started buying stocks heavily
the program traders were in there too of course
but according to one trader the programmers did n't look as dominant on the upside as on the downside because there was also a lot of bargain - hunting by institutions
<unk> <unk> <unk> director of the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> which oversees n billion in investments said n the first thing <unk> we did was to double our orders yesterday morning
with the market down like this we probably take another n million and put it in the market
trading in <unk> <unk> <unk> particularly caught traders eyes
according to <unk> <unk> officials <unk> had one of the biggest sell - order imbalances on <unk> it was one of the seven stocks that could n't finish trading that day
the stock opened late at <unk> <unk> down <unk> <unk>
but then it shot upward n n as <unk> <unk> <unk> stepped in and bought traders said n
however <unk> specialist <unk> <unk> said i would be surprised if <unk> represented <unk> of the opening volume
around <unk> <unk> trading desks were relieved that they could at least play the market yesterday in contrast to <unk> gridlock
at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> head equity trader <unk> <unk> said i think n the opening was constructive
it was orderly
we put some orders together
there was n't a lot of panic selling either domestically or internationally
not like <unk> where they just took the market apart
still the market had n't yet crossed into positive territory and traders were glum
but in another dramatic burst the <unk> tacked on n points in five minutes and at <unk> the index showed a gain of <unk>
on the <unk> <unk> floor and on trading desks traders yelped their approval
grinned <unk> <unk> a trader in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> department i tell you n this market acts healthy
around him scores of traders seemed to get a burst of energy their boss broke out bottles of <unk> water to cool them off
among <unk> <unk> specialists the cry was pull your offers meaning that specialists soon expected to get higher prices for their shares
it was bedlam on the upside said one <unk> <unk> specialist
but not everybody was making money
the carnage on the <unk> <unk> options <unk> the nation major options market was heavy after the trading in <unk> <unk> stock - index options was halted <unk>
many market makers in the <unk> <unk> index options contract had bullish positions <unk> and when the shutdown came they were frozen with huge losses
over the weekend clearing firms told the <unk> market makers to get out of their positions at any cost <unk> morning
they were absolutely killed slaughtered said one <unk> - based options trader
some traders said that the closely watched <unk> <unk> <unk> whose <unk> stocks mimic the <unk> industrials did n't lead yesterday big rally
<unk> <unk> a partner at specialist <unk> <unk> said the difference between today and two years ago <unk> <unk> <unk> n <unk> is that then we needed a savior to go into the <unk> <unk> <unk> spend n million and get the program rally started
this time institutions saw the programs coming and backed away and backed away
then when the market was at a technical level n to buy they came in with a vengeance
however according to one analyst the timing of <unk> <unk> index futures buying just before the turnaround was similar to that of terrible <unk>
futures were pulling the stock market higher said <unk> <unk> head of stock - index futures research at <unk> - <unk> securities <unk>
although the <unk> <unk> specialist firms struggled through another highly volatile trading session their performance yesterday was better than during <unk> late - afternoon chaos according to traders and brokers who work with them
specialists were criticized for their inability to maintain orderly markets during the <unk> plunge
but yesterday even with halts in such major blue - chip stocks as <unk> we expected the halts and it was n't too bad said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who had been critical of the specialists performance on <unk>
according to a <unk> <unk> official while many stocks opened late there were subsequent trading halts in only three issues <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> is one of the most important stocks in the <unk> <unk> <unk>
no sector of the market has been spared during the past two days gyrations
yet from the <unk> industrials high on <unk> n through <unk> plunge relatively good performances have been turned in by real - estate utilities precious metals and life insurance stocks
and yesterday the top performing industry group was oil field equipment issues
for example <unk> jumped <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> rose <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> rose <unk> <unk> to n
because of the <unk> and <unk> tumbles airlines were the weakest sector of the market yesterday
<unk> <unk> was the <unk> <unk> most active issue rising <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> on nearly eight million shares
among other major issues <unk> - <unk> <unk> closed up n at <unk> <unk> on n million shares and <unk> <unk> <unk> rose <unk> <unk> to <unk> on nearly n million shares
shares of <unk> <unk> <unk> which reported earnings yesterday finished at <unk> up <unk> after slipping below <unk> during <unk> session for the first time in five years
shares of three brokerage firms rose after they reported earnings
<unk> <unk> added <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> rose <unk> to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> rose <unk> to <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a recently hot stock climbed <unk> to <unk> on nearly n million shares
at a news conference after the close of trading yesterday the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other exchange officials praised the performance of their computers and personnel
<unk> <unk> said that program trading strategies were n't responsible for triggering <unk> decline despite a jump in the use of the computer - driven strategies in recent months
some n million of the more than n million shares traded in the final n minutes of <unk> session when the plunge in stock prices was concentrated were program - related he said n
<unk> trades make up n of the exchange volume on an average day but despite the increase <unk> it was certainly not something n you would say n precipitated the market decline <unk> <unk> said <unk>
<unk> <unk> expressed relief that the market rebounded yesterday
obviously every time n we get this kind of reaction it going to make everybody nervous including me he said
he said that exchange officials had conversations with <unk> <unk> firms throughout the weekend and that all the participants behaved very very responsibly today
meanwhile <unk> <unk> <unk> head of retail equity trading praised institutional investors in the <unk> market who were heavy buyers of the <unk> biggest technology issues yesterday amid a flood of selling by other investors
the institutions ca n't be criticized for their behavior <unk> <unk> said in an interview
it was the opposite of what happened on <unk> n
they used their judgment
they did n't panic during the first round of selling this morning
instead they bought on weakness and sold into the strength which kept the market orderly
maybe they learned from experience
<unk> <unk> said <unk> the performance of specialists during <unk> plunge was admirable because out of <unk> <unk> <unk> common stocks traded during the day only seven were closed and were n't reopened before the close
they did an excellent job <unk> <unk> said of the specialists
<unk> <unk> traders on <unk> had complained about the trading suspensions
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> contributed to this article
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> joined its ideological soulmates <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> in the legal battle <unk> to ground the <unk> shuttle and its plutonium - powered <unk> probe to <unk>

of course it was
<unk> should now sue for fines against all three politico - plaintiffs foreign and domestic for bringing this mischievous case
a <unk> - <unk> conference approved a permanent smoking ban on all domestic airline routes within the continental <unk> and on all flights of six hours or less to <unk> and <unk>
the restrictions would cover all but a small percentage of domestic air traffic and represent a major expansion of the current smoking ban on flights of two hours or less
the exemption allowed on longer flights to <unk> and <unk> appears to be largely a face - saving concession for the traditionally powerful tobacco industry which has found itself increasingly isolated in the face of public pressure in recent years
by a <unk> margin <unk> negotiators initially rejected last night a <unk> provision covering all domestic flights
but the six - hour compromise was soon agreed to in subsequent discussions
as a practical matter flights from the <unk> <unk> to <unk> would be covered as they are under the time limit but the language would exempt longer routes beginning for example in <unk> or on the <unk> <unk>
within the <unk> the ban has had aggressive support from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who has used his position as a <unk> <unk> subcommittee chairman to garner votes for the initiative
the measure is attached to the more than n billion fiscal n transportation bill within <unk> <unk> jurisdiction and the final compromise is laced with more than n million in road projects earmarked by members as well as funds sought by major airports including <unk>
from the outset the tobacco industry has been uncertain as to what strategy to follow
but the industry retains support in the <unk> leadership through the influence of grower states such as <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> owes a political debt to southern agriculture lawmakers for his rise in the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> used his position in the conference to salvage the exemption from a total ban
although the smoking provision has attracted the most public interest the underlying bill was the subject of behind - the-scenes lobbying because of its impact on air transportation and the more mundane but politically important projects of members
in a stark lesson in the power of the appropriations committees the <unk> deliberately killed a handful of projects backed by lawmakers in <unk> <unk> and <unk> who had voted against the panel leadership on the <unk> floor
anybody can vote as they want said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> head of the <unk> conferees
but if you make a request you should support the committee
within the <unk> <unk> <unk> the final bill promises to increase spending for facilities and equipment by more than <unk> from last year and total operations would rise to <unk> billion a <unk> boost
the facilities account includes n million for <unk> ambitious new airport and the competition for these funds created shifting alliances between urban lawmakers representing established airports in <unk> and <unk> and the major carriers to <unk> <unk> and <unk>
<unk> of the costs and critics say competition the airlines have sought to gain leverage over the city of <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> which owns <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> were prominent in the lobbying
the industry sought to impose conditions that would have delayed funds for the project until <unk> and the airlines had agreed to leases for n of the gates
but this was rejected in favor of much looser language directing the <unk> <unk> to review the costs of the first phase expected to cost about n billion
though smaller in total dollars the conference agreed to preserve an estimated n million in controversial subsidies to carriers serving rural or isolated airports
the sum is more than double what the <unk> had approved for the program but the list of qualified airports would be cut by n under new distance requirements and limits on the level of subsidy
<unk> previously cut six airports this year
the impact of the changes is to eliminate many of the most excessive cases where the government has been paying more than <unk> for each passenger in subsidies
among rail and highway accounts the agreement provides n million for <unk> including n million for capital improvements
and federal - formula grants for mass transit would be effectively frozen at <unk> billion or n million more than last fiscal year

officials at <unk> based in <unk> declined comment
<unk> has been critical of the <unk> administration for not sending enough aid to <unk> so it is getting ready to send its own version of a <unk> package
last month the <unk> voted to send a delegation of congressional staffers to <unk> to assist its legislature the <unk> in democratic procedures
<unk> <unk> <unk> calls this effort the first gift of democracy
the poles might do better to view it as a <unk> <unk>
it is the vast shadow government of <unk> congressional staffers that helps create such legislative atrocities as the <unk> page n reconciliation bill that claimed to be the budget of the <unk> <unk>
maybe after the staffers explain their work to the poles they be willing to come back and do the same for the american people
<unk> <unk> <unk> a financially troubled irish maker of fine crystal and <unk> china reported that its pretax loss for the first six months widened to n million irish punts n million from n million irish punts a year earlier
the results for the half were worse than market expectations which suggested an interim loss of around n million irish punts
in a sharply weaker <unk> market yesterday <unk> shares were down n pence at <unk> pence n cents
the company reported a loss after taxation and minority interests of n million irish punts compared with a loss of n million irish punts for the year - earlier period
there were n't any extraordinary items

<unk> said <unk> the appointment of a new management team and the signing of a comprehensive labor agreement are expected to enhance the company long - term prospects
the sudden flight to quality that triggered <unk> explosive bond - market rally was reversed yesterday in a flight from quality rout
the setback in which <unk> bond prices plummeted reflected a rebound in the stock market and profit - taking
it was a pretty wild day
our markets were closely tied to the stock market said <unk> <unk> manager of trading at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> flight to quality was no longer needed once the stock market found its legs he said
some fixed - income investors had expected a further drop in stock prices after the nearly n drop in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk>
that caused investors to flee stocks and buy high - quality <unk> bonds which are safer than other types of securities
but when stocks began to climb instead prices of <unk> bonds declined
contributing to the selling pressure were dispatches by several investment firms advising clients to boost their stock holdings and reduce the size of their cash or bond portfolios
among the firms were <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the bond market seemed to ignore evidence that the <unk> <unk> eased credit conditions slightly by allowing the federal funds rate to drift as low as <unk> <unk>
the closely watched rate on federal funds or overnight loans between banks slid to about <unk> <unk> last week down from its perceived target level of about <unk>
the rate is considered an early signal of changes in <unk> policy
traders said <unk> yesterday modest easing did n't stir much enthusiasm because it had been widely expected
in fact some economists contend that the latest easing started last week
others note that some investors were disappointed because they had expected a more aggressive easing
the <unk> benchmark <unk> bond ended about <unk> <unk> points lower or down about n for each <unk> face amount
the reversal was even more evident among shorter - term <unk> securities
after <unk> bill rates plummeted as much as n percentage point on <unk> they gave back three - fourths of that amount yesterday
the bond - equivalent yield on three - month <unk> bills for example was quoted late yesterday at <unk> compared with n <unk>
investment - grade corporate bonds mortgage - backed securities and municipal bonds also fell
but prices of junk bonds which were battered <unk> in near standstill trading rebounded to post small gains after a volatile trading session

what happening in photography mirrors the popularity of black and white in fashion home furnishings and cinematography
on <unk> <unk> designers have been advancing the monochrome look with clothing collections done entirely in black and white
and classic black - and-white movies are enjoying a comeback on videocassette tapes spurred in part by the backlash against colorization of old films
the pendulum is swinging back to black and white says <unk> <unk> the general manager of <unk> <unk> <unk> professional photography division
until two years ago sales of black - and-white film had been declining steadily since the <unk>
but last year buoyed by increased use in advertising and other commercial applications sales increased n and they are expected to jump at least that much again this year
photographic companies are scrambling to tap the resurging market reviving some black - and-white product lines and developing new ones
at <unk> which largely ignored the market for years black - and-white film sales now account for nearly n of the company n billion in film and paper sales annually up from <unk> three years ago

slated for market by the end of the year the paper could have been introduced a long time ago but the market was n't there then says n an <unk> spokesman
the biggest beneficiary of the black - and-white revival is likely to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> division known in the industry for its premium products
sales of <unk> four varieties of black - and-white film this year are outpacing growth in the overall market although the company wo n't say by exactly how much
we hope <unk> the trend lasts says <unk> <unk> <unk> marketing communications director
why all the interest
for baby boomers who grew up being photographed in color black and white seems eye - catching and exotic
it has an archival almost nostalgic quality to it says <unk> <unk> <unk> the chairman of the applied photography department at <unk> <unk> of <unk>
you can shift out of reality with black and white he adds n
such features have been especially attractive to professional photographers and marketing executives who have been steadily increasing their use of black and white in advertising
processing of black - and-white commercial film jumped <unk> last year to n million rolls
consider <unk> <unk> whose latest ad campaign features black - and-white shots of <unk> stars artists and other well - known personalities modeling the retailer jeans and t - shirts
<unk> <unk> the account manager for the campaign says <unk> <unk> did n't intentionally choose black and white to distinguish its ads from the color spreads of competitors
we wanted to highlight the individual not the environment he says and black and white allows you to do that better than color
the campaign won a <unk> award as this year best ad by a specialty retailer
even food products and automobiles which have long depended on color are making the switch
companies feel n black and white will convey a stronger statement says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> photographer who is working on a black - and-white print ad for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>

i show it to my friends and they all say wow
it is n't ordinary like color
still most consumers are n't plunking black - and-white film into their cameras to take family snapshots
one big obstacle is that few drugstores develop the film anymore
typically it must be mailed to a handful of processors and may take a week or more to be processed and returned
<unk> - and-white film costs consumers a little less than color film and processing costs the same
but for photofinishers developing costs for black - and-white film are higher
some companies are starting to tackle that problem
<unk> for example recently introduced a black - and-white film that can be processed quickly by color labs
intent on wooing customers the company is also increasing its sponsorship of black - and-white photography classes
similarly <unk> is sponsoring scores of photography contests at high schools and colleges offering free black - and-white film and paper as prizes

it seems n computers as hobbies have waned says <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman and chief executive officer
but some industry observers believe n the resurgence of black and white is only a fad
they cite the emergence of still electronic photography more newspapers turning to color on their pages and measurable improvements in the quality of color prints
black and white has n't made the same quantum leaps in technological development as color says <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
the color print today is far superior to prints of n years ago
you ca n't say the same with black and white
but when <unk> <unk> a leading magazine for photographers selected <unk> of the greatest photos ever made for its latest issue celebrating photography <unk> anniversary all were black and white
it got a classic spirit and carries over emotionally says <unk> <unk> of <unk> photographers of <unk>
that the appeal
<unk> newspapers <unk> said n improvements in advertising and subscription revenue led to a <unk> gain in third - quarter profit to n million or n cents a share from n million or n cents a share
sales rose more than <unk> to n million from n million
the <unk> <unk> company also attributed improved performance to a lower effective tax rate and higher interest income

while <unk> plunging stock market prompted new fears about the economy prospects a little - known indicator that has faithfully foreshadowed the economy ups and downs by exceptionally long lead times points to a sustained rise in overall business activity
the barometer developed by analysts at <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> here reached a record high of <unk> in <unk> the latest month available and the <unk> researchers estimate that it has moved even higher since then
the latest reading of <unk> was up from <unk> in <unk> and <unk> as recently as <unk>
the <unk> rise marked the fifth straight monthly gain for the indicator which uses the <unk> average as a base of n
in contrast the <unk> <unk> widely followed index of leading indicators while up in <unk> has fallen repeatedly since reaching a high early this year
its ragged behavior through much of <unk> has prompted some forecasters to anticipate the start of a new recession perhaps before year end
but the far stronger showing of the <unk> index makes a recession any time soon highly unlikely says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the director of the <unk> facility
a leading authority on the business cycle <unk> <unk> also is a member of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the panel of private economists that decides for the government when expansions and recessions begin and end
the group normally convenes only when a change in the economy general course seems likely
no meeting is scheduled because the expansion shows no sign of going off the tracks <unk> <unk> reports
based largely on the recent strength in their index called the long leading indicator the <unk> analysts foresee uninterrupted economic growth through the rest of this year and next year as well
they expect a <unk> rise in <unk> in the gross national product after adjustment for inflation
underlying this optimism is the index longstanding ability to signal recessions or recoveries as the case may be by substantially greater periods than the <unk> <unk> index of leading indicators
over the full post - <unk> <unk> <unk> era the <unk> index on the average has entered sustained declines n months before the onset of recessions and turned up eight months before recoveries
the comparable lead times for the <unk> index whose components include the stock market are far shorter <unk> months before recessions and only three months before recoveries
the <unk> economists also have reconstructed how the long leading index would have behaved had it existed in <unk> before the stock market crash in <unk> that ushered in the <unk> <unk>
the indicator reached a peak in <unk> n and then fell steadily up to and through the crash
it was an entirely different pattern from what we seeing now <unk> <unk> says
a major source of the recent strength in the long leading indicator has been the performance of the <unk> <unk> corporate bond - price index which is not a part of the <unk> index
in <unk> the bond measure was at its highest monthly average since early n
it also rose last <unk> while the stock market sagged
other components of the long leading indicator include a ratio of prices to unit labor costs in manufacturing industries the <unk> version of the money supply adjusted for inflation and the volume of new home - building permits
notably absent from the <unk> index is the stock market which <unk> <unk> says <unk> is simply no longer such a good indicator of the economy long - range prospects though it still is useful for anticipating some short - run twists and turns
as recently as <unk> the stock market as reflected in the <unk> <unk> index of <unk> common stocks was rated by the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> as the best of the <unk> leading indicators that then made up the <unk> index
it was assigned a mark of <unk> out of a possible n compared with scores ranging as low as n for the other components
the stock market has lost some precursory power analysts at the <unk> center claim n because of the growing impact of international developments
stocks have become more sensitive to factors not directly tied to the domestic economy <unk> <unk> says citing the exchange rate for the dollar on currency markets the foreign - trade balance and inflows of foreign capital
he also feels that the rise of such computer - based practices as program trading has diminished the stock market relevancy to the economic outlook

gold was nowhere the spectacular performer n it was two years ago on <unk> <unk>
for one thing last <unk> precious metals markets closed before the stock market went into its late - in-the-day nose dive so it could n't react to it
back on <unk> <unk> n <unk> the stock market declined during the day and gold prices surged as the stock market fell

<unk> recently bought <unk> tons and was expected to buy more the analyst said <unk>
another analyst thought that <unk> may have pulled back because of the concern over the stock market

<unk> <unk> disclosed the planned steps expected within a few months as <unk> <unk> posted a n drop in its third - quarter pretax earnings
the name change and good will write - off could help solidify <unk> <unk> dominance of the <unk> temporary - help market and give it a more american image as <unk> investors turn jittery about foreign stocks after <unk> market plunge
<unk> holders now own more than n of <unk> <unk> compared with n last <unk>
in the <unk> market the recognition of the <unk> name is infinitely stronger than <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said
the moves also could erase shareholders perception of <unk> <unk> as a company in turmoil
it further reinforces the concept that <unk> <unk> is a thing of the past said <unk> <unk> an analyst at <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
the proposed changes all make a lot of sense to me he added n
in a widely publicized boardroom coup <unk> <unk> ousted <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> chief executive in <unk> a month after <unk> <unk> had forced <unk> <unk> out as the n million - a-year chief of <unk> - based <unk>
<unk> <unk> solidified his control in <unk> by taking over from <unk> <unk> as chairman
but the <unk> <unk> tumult is n't over yet as the british government is investigating a disputed <unk> million n million loan which <unk> <unk> has said <unk> was made under <unk> <unk> direction
<unk> <unk> was able to pull off the <unk> billion takeover of <unk> in <unk> largely because different british and american accounting standards produce higher reported earnings for british companies
under british rules <unk> <unk> was able to write off at once the n billion in good will arising from the purchase
as a u.s.-based company <unk> <unk> would have to amortize the good will over as many as n years creating a continuing drag on reported earnings
good will is the excess of cost of an acquired firm operating unit or assets over the current or fair market value of those assets
but with so many shares now held in the <unk> <unk> <unk> reports its earnings two ways based on both <unk> and <unk> accounting standards
our balance sheets look like they came from <unk> wonderland <unk> <unk> said
the british version shows a handful of pounds of net worth following the n write - off of good will while the american version reflects n billion of net worth because almost none of the good will has been written off
<unk> <unk> said <unk> he hopes to eradicate some of the good will left on <unk> <unk> <unk> books in one fell swoop but would n't specify how much
people close to <unk> <unk> suggested n the write - down would represent a sizable chunk with executives claiming n prior management overstated the extent of <unk> good will
that move along with the return to the <unk> name could bolster the company prospects during possibly difficult times for temporary help
the number of <unk> temporary workers fell about <unk> in the <unk> months ending <unk> <unk> after sliding nearly n in <unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> blamed the pretax profit drop in the quarter ended <unk> <unk> partly on slower earnings growth of non - <unk> units in <unk>

<unk> <unk> <unk> the man credited with transforming <unk> <unk> <unk> from an underachiever into a feisty player in the global market for hydraulic tools hopes to guide a similar turnaround at the company latest acquisition <unk> <unk> <unk>
the <unk> former <unk> <unk> <unk> executive figures n it will be easier this time
but analysts while applauding the acquisition say <unk> <unk> chief executive faces a tough challenge in integrating the two companies
<unk> <unk> acquired by <unk> for n million makes computer - room equipment and vibration - control systems
the <unk> <unk> company sales have been dormant and its profits have dropped
last year earnings of n million including n from a restructuring gain were far below the year - earlier n million
besides spurring <unk> <unk> sales which were n million in <unk> <unk> <unk> must pare its costs and product line
the question is how long it going to take <unk> <unk> to make a contribution says <unk> <unk> <unk> an analyst at <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>
the answer will help determine whether <unk> continues to reach the ambitious goals set by <unk> <unk>
the <unk> <unk> manufacturer went public at <unk> a share in <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> goal then was a n per - share price by <unk>
strong earnings growth helped achieve that price far ahead of schedule in <unk> <unk>
the stock has since softened trading around <unk> a share last week and closing yesterday at n in national over - the-counter trading
but <unk> <unk> has set a fresh target of <unk> a share by the end
reaching that goal says n <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> chief financial officer will require efficient reinvestment of cash by <unk> and continuation of its healthy n rate of return on operating capital
in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> sees a situation very similar to the one n he faced when he joined <unk> as president and chief operating officer in <unk>
<unk> then a closely held company was stagnating under the management of its controlling family
while profitable it was n't growing and was n't providing a satisfactory return on invested capital he says n
<unk> <unk> is confident that the drive to dominate certain niche markets will work at <unk> <unk> as it has at <unk>
he also professes an evangelical fervor n to develop a corporate culture that rewards managers who produce and where decision - making is shared
<unk> <unk> considers the new unit operations fundamentally sound and adds that <unk> <unk> has been fairly successful in moving into markets that have n't interested larger competitors
with a little patience these businesses will perform very satisfactorily <unk> <unk> says
within about six months things will be moving in the right direction he predicts n
<unk> <unk> figures n it will be easier to turn <unk> <unk> around since he now in the driver seat
when he came to <unk> i did n't have the power to execute as i do today he says n
he was named chief executive officer of <unk> in <unk> and became chairman last <unk>
at <unk> <unk> <unk> set growth as his first objective
he took the company public in an offering that netted applied about n million which helped launch the company acquisition program
sales climbed to an estimated n million in fiscal <unk> ended <unk> n from n million in fiscal <unk>
the company expects that earnings which have marched steadily upward in recent years reached about n million or <unk> a share in the fiscal year just ended up from n million in fiscal <unk> and n million in <unk>
no it was n't black <unk>
but while the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> did n't fall apart <unk> as the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> plunged n points most of it in the final hour it barely managed to stay this side of chaos
some circuit breakers installed after the <unk> <unk> crash failed their first test traders say <unk> unable to cool the selling panic in both stocks and futures
the <unk> stock specialist firms on the <unk> <unk> floor the buyers and sellers of last resort who were criticized after the <unk> crash once again could n't handle the selling pressure
big investment banks refused to step up to the plate to support the beleaguered floor traders by buying big blocks of stock traders say n
heavy selling of <unk> <unk> <unk> index futures in <unk> relentlessly beat stocks downward
seven <unk> <unk> stocks <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> stopped trading and never resumed
the finger - pointing has already begun
the equity market was illiquid
once again the specialists were not able to handle the imbalances on the floor of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> senior vice president at <unk> - <unk> securities <unk>
countered <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman of specialists <unk> brothers <unk> it is easy to say n the specialist is n't doing his job
when the dollar is in a free - fall even central banks ca n't stop it
speculators are calling for a degree of liquidity that is not there in the market
many money managers and some traders had already left their offices early <unk> afternoon on a warm autumn day because the stock market was so quiet
then in a lightning plunge the <unk> <unk> industrials in barely an hour surrendered about a third of their gains this year chalking up a <unk> or <unk> loss on the day in gargantuan trading volume
final - hour trading accelerated to n million shares a record for the <unk> <unk>
at the end of the day n million shares were traded
the <unk> <unk> industrials closed at <unk>
the <unk> decline was second in point terms only to the <unk> <unk> <unk> crash that occurred <unk> n <unk>
in percentage terms however the <unk> dive was the <unk> ever and the sharpest since the market fell <unk> or <unk> a week after <unk> <unk>
the <unk> fell <unk> on <unk> <unk>
shares of <unk> the parent of <unk> <unk> were extremely active all day <unk> reacting to news and rumors about the proposed n billion buy - out of the airline by an employee - management group
<unk> <unk> takeover - stock speculators or risk arbitragers had placed unusually large bets that a takeover would succeed and <unk> stock would rise
at n p.m. <unk> came the sickening news <unk> <unk> <unk> was halting trading in <unk> pending news
on the exchange floor as soon as <unk> stopped trading we braced for a panic said n one top floor trader
several traders could be seen shaking their heads when the news flashed
for weeks the market had been nervous about takeovers after <unk> <unk> cash crunch spurred concern about the prospects for future highly leveraged takeovers
and <unk> minutes after the <unk> trading halt came news that the <unk> group could n't get financing for its bid
at this point the <unk> was down about n points
the market crumbled
arbitragers could n't dump their <unk> stock but they rid themselves of nearly every rumor stock n they had
for example their selling caused trading halts to be declared in <unk> <unk> which closed down <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which fell n <unk> to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> which sank <unk> to <unk> <unk>
these stocks eventually reopened
but as panic spread speculators began to sell blue - chip stocks such as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> machines to offset their losses
when trading was halted in <unk> <unk> the stock was trading at <unk> down <unk> n while <unk> closed <unk> <unk> lower at n
selling snowballed because of waves of automatic stop - loss orders which are triggered by computer when prices fall to certain levels
most of the stock selling pressure came from <unk> <unk> professionals including computer - guided program traders
traders said n most of their major institutional investors on the other hand sat tight
now at n one of the market post - crash reforms took hold as the <unk> <unk> futures contract had plunged <unk> points equivalent to around a <unk> drop in the <unk> industrials
under an agreement signed by the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> trading was temporarily halted in <unk>
after the trading halt in the <unk> <unk> pit in <unk> waves of selling continued to hit stocks themselves on the <unk> <unk> and specialists continued to notch prices down
as a result the link between the futures and stock markets ripped apart
without the guidepost of stock - index futures the barometer of where traders think n the overall stock market is headed many traders were afraid to trust stock prices quoted on the <unk> <unk>
the futures halt was even assailed by <unk> <unk> floor traders
it screwed things up said one major specialist
this confusion effectively halted one form of program trading stock index arbitrage that closely links the futures and stock markets and has been blamed by some for the market big swings
in a stock - index arbitrage sell program traders buy or sell big baskets of stocks and offset the trade in futures to lock in a price difference
when the airline information came through it cracked every model n we had for the marketplace said a managing director at one of the largest program - trading firms
we did n't even get a chance to do the programs n we wanted to do
but stocks kept falling
the <unk> industrials were down n points at n p.m. before the futures - trading halt
at n p.m. at the end of the cooling off period the average was down n points
meanwhile during the the <unk> trading halt <unk> futures sell orders began piling up while stocks in <unk> <unk> kept falling sharply
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said yesterday <unk> the circuit breaker worked well mechanically
i just think n it nonproductive at this point to get into a debate if index arbitrage would have helped or hurt things
under another post - crash system <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was flying to <unk> as the market was falling was talking on an inter - exchange hot line to the other exchanges the securities and <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
he camped out at a high - tech nerve center on the floor of the <unk> <unk> where he could watch updates on prices and pending stock orders
at about n p.m. <unk> <unk> futures resumed trading and for a brief time the futures and stock markets started to come back in line
buyers stepped in to the futures pit
but the build - up of <unk> futures sell orders weighed on the market and the link with stocks began to fray again
at about <unk> the <unk> market careened to still another limit of <unk> points down and trading was locked again
futures traders say n the <unk> was signaling that the <unk> could fall as much as n points
during this time small investors began ringing their brokers wondering whether another crash had begun
at <unk> - <unk> securities <unk> which is trying to cater to small investors some demoralized brokers thought n this would be the final confidence - crusher
that when <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman of the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> unit took to the internal intercom system to declare that the plunge was only mechanical
i have a hunch that this particular decline today is something more ado about less
it would be my inclination to advise clients not to sell to look for an opportunity to buy <unk> <unk> told the brokers
at <unk> <unk> <unk> the nation biggest brokerage firm a news release was prepared headlined <unk> <unk> comments on market drop
the release cautioned that there are significant differences between the current environment and that of <unk> <unk> and that there are still attractive investment opportunities in the stock market
however <unk> <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said that <unk> plunge is going to set back relations with customers because it reinforces the concern of volatility
and i think n a lot of people will harp on program trading
it going to bring the debate right back to the forefront
as the <unk> average ground to its final <unk> loss <unk> the <unk> pit stayed locked at its n trading limit
<unk> <unk> of program trader <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> contracts were for sale on the close the equivalent of n million in stock
but there were no buyers
while <unk> debacle involved mainly professional traders rather than investors it left the market vulnerable to continued selling this morning traders said n
stock - index futures contracts settled at much lower prices than indexes of the stock market itself
at those levels stocks are set up to be hammered by index arbitragers who lock in profits by buying futures when futures prices fall and simultaneously sell off stocks
but nobody knows at what level the futures and stocks will open today
the de - linkage between the stock and futures markets <unk> will undoubtedly cause renewed debate about whether <unk> <unk> is properly prepared for another crash situation
the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said n our systemic performance was good
but the exchange will look at the performance of all specialists in all stocks
obviously we take a close look at any situation in which we think n the dealer - community obligations were n't met he said
see related story <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> funds <unk> <unk> n <unk>
but specialists complain privately that just as in the <unk> crash the upstairs firms big investment banks that support the market by trading big blocks of stock stayed on the sidelines during <unk> blood - letting
<unk> <unk> said <unk> it will take another day or two to analyze who was buying and selling <unk>
concerning your <unk> n page - one article on <unk> <unk> and the leeches it a few hundred years since <unk> has been a kingdom

two years ago there were massive redemption levels over the weekend and a lot of fear around said <unk> <unk> <unk> who runs <unk> <unk> <unk> billion <unk> - <unk> <unk>
this feels more like a one - shot deal
people are n't panicking
the test may come today
<unk> stock market sell - off came too late for many investors to act
some shareholders have held off until today because any fund exchanges made after <unk> close would take place at today closing prices
stock fund redemptions during the <unk> debacle did n't begin to snowball until after the market opened on <unk> <unk>
but fund managers say n they ready
many have raised cash levels which act as a buffer against steep market declines
<unk> <unk> for instance holds cash positions well above n in several of his funds
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said n they had raised their cash levels to more than <unk> and <unk> respectively this year
even <unk> <unk> manager of <unk> <unk> billion <unk> <unk> the nation largest stock fund built up cash to <unk> or n million
one reason is that after two years of monthly net redemptions the fund posted net inflows of money from investors in <unk> and <unk>
i let the money build up <unk> <unk> said who added that he has had trouble finding stocks n he likes
not all funds have raised cash levels of course
as a group stock funds held n of assets in cash as of <unk> the latest figures available from the <unk> <unk> <unk>
that was modestly higher than the <unk> and <unk> levels in <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
also persistent redemptions would force some fund managers to dump stocks to raise cash
but a strong level of investor withdrawals is much more unlikely this time around fund managers said n
a major reason is that investors already have sharply scaled back their purchases of stock funds since <unk> <unk>
stock - fund sales have rebounded in recent months but monthly net purchases are still running at less than half n levels
there not nearly as much froth said <unk> <unk> chairman of <unk> <unk> <unk> a big <unk> <unk> <unk> fund company

this is not a major crash she said
nevertheless <unk> <unk> said <unk> she was swamped with phone calls over the weekend from nervous shareholders
half of them are really scared and want to sell she said but i trying to talk them out of it
she added <unk> if they all were bullish i really be upset
the backdrop to <unk> slide was markedly different from that of the <unk> <unk> crash fund managers argue n
two years ago unlike today the dollar was weak interest rates were rising and the market was very overvalued they say n
from the investors standpoint institutions and individuals learned a painful lesson by selling at the lows on <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> manager of the n million <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
this time i do n't think <unk> we get a panic reaction

<unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> told <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> it was supposed to get this <unk> would n't be delivered until <unk> n the day after the airline had been planning to initiate service at <unk> with four daily flights including three nonstops to <unk> and one nonstop to <unk> <unk>
now those routes are n't expected to begin until <unk>
<unk> is also supposed to send to <unk> <unk> another <unk> twin - engine aircraft as well as a n by year end
those too are almost certain to arrive late
at this point no other <unk> <unk> flights including its new service at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> have been affected by the delays in <unk> deliveries
nevertheless the company reaction underscores the domino effect that a huge manufacturer such as <unk> can have on other parts of the economy
it also is sure to help the machinists put added pressure on the company
i just do n't feel that the company can really stand or would want a prolonged walkout <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> <unk> said in an interview yesterday
i do n't think <unk> their customers would like it very much
<unk> <unk> though is a smaller airline and therefore more affected by the delayed delivery of a single plane than many of its competitors would be
i figure that american and <unk> probably have such a hard time counting all the planes in their fleets n they might not miss one at all <unk> <unk> said
indeed a random check <unk> did n't seem to indicate that the strike was having much of an effect on other airline operations
<unk> <unk> has a <unk> <unk> set for delivery at the end of this month and expects to have the plane on time
it so close to completion <unk> <unk> told us n there wo n't be a problem said a <unk> spokesman
a spokesman for <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> has assured <unk> <unk> <unk> it will deliver a n on time later this month
<unk> is preparing to take delivery of another n in early <unk> and <unk> more next year and is n't anticipating any changes in that timetable
in <unk> a <unk> spokesman explained that the company has been in constant communication with all of its customers and that it was impossible to predict what further disruptions might be triggered by the strike
meanwhile supervisors and non - striking employees have been trying to finish some n aircraft mostly <unk> and <unk> jumbo jets at the company <unk> <unk> plant that were all but completed before the walkout
as of <unk> four had been delivered and a fifth plane a n was supposed to be flown out over the weekend to <unk> <unk>
no date has yet been set n to get back to the bargaining table
we want to make sure n they know what they want before they come back said <unk> <unk> the federal mediator who has been in contact with both sides since the strike began
the investment community for one has been anticipating a speedy resolution
though <unk> stock price was battered along with the rest of the market <unk> it actually has risen over the last two weeks on the strength of new orders
the market has taken two views that the labor situation will get settled in the short term and that things look very rosy for <unk> in the long term said <unk> <unk> an analyst at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> shares fell <unk> <unk> to close at <unk> in composite trading on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
but <unk> <unk> said <unk> he thinks n the earliest n a pact could be struck would be the end of this month hinting that the company and union may resume negotiations as early as this week
still he said n it possible that the strike could last considerably longer
i would n't expect an immediate resolution to anything
last week <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> sent striking workers a letter saying that to my knowledge <unk> offer represents the best overall three - year contract of any major <unk> industrial firm in recent history
but <unk> <unk> called the letter and the company offer of a n wage increase over the life of the pact plus bonuses very weak
he added that the company miscalculated the union resolve and the workers disgust with being forced to work many hours overtime
in separate developments talks have broken off between machinists representatives at <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> aerospace company
the union is continuing to work through its expired contract however
it had planned a strike vote for next <unk> but that has been pushed back indefinitely
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which represents n workers at <unk> helicopter unit in <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> it agreed to extend its contract on a day - by-day basis with a n notification to cancel while it continues bargaining
the accord expired yesterday
and <unk> on <unk> said n it received an order from <unk> <unk> for four model n wide - body jetliners valued at a total of about n million
the planes long range versions of the medium - haul twin - jet will be delivered with <unk> <unk> <unk> engines
<unk> <unk> is a unit of <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is based in <unk>
a <unk> spokeswoman said <unk> a delivery date for the planes is still being worked out for a variety of reasons but not because of the strike
<unk> <unk> contributed to this article
<unk> <unk> said <unk> its utilities arm is considering building new electric power plants some valued at more than one billion canadian dollars <unk> n million in <unk> <unk> and elsewhere
<unk> <unk> <unk> senior vice president finance said <unk> its <unk> <unk> utilities <unk> unit is reviewing cogeneration projects in eastern <unk> and conventional electric power generating plants elsewhere including <unk> where the british government plans to allow limited competition in electrical generation from private - sector suppliers as part of its privatization program
the projects are big
they can be c$ n billion plus <unk> <unk> said
but we would n't go into them alone and canadian utilities equity stake would be small he said n
ideally we like to be the operator of the project and a modest equity investor
our long suit is our proven ability to operate power plants he said n
<unk> <unk> would n't offer specifics regarding <unk> proposed british project but he said n it would compete for customers with two huge british power generating companies that would be formed under the country plan to privatize its massive water and electric utilities
<unk> government plans to raise about <unk> billion n billion from the sale of most of its giant water and electric utilities beginning next month
the planned electric utility sale scheduled for next year is alone expected to raise n billion making it the world largest public offering
under terms of the plan independent generators would be able to compete for n of customers until <unk> and for another <unk> between <unk> and <unk>
canadian <unk> had <unk> revenue of <unk> n billion mainly from its natural gas and electric utility businesses in <unk> where the company serves about n customers
there seems to be a move around the world to deregulate the generation of electricity <unk> <unk> said <unk> and <unk> <unk> hopes to capitalize on it
this is a real thrust on our utility side he said adding that <unk> <unk> is also mulling projects in underdeveloped countries though he would be specific
canadian utilities is n't alone in exploring power generation opportunities in <unk> in anticipation of the privatization program
we certainly looking at some power generating projects in <unk> said <unk> <unk> vice president corporate strategy and corporate planning with <unk> <unk> <unk> a big natural gas producer and pipeline operator
<unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> is considering building gas - fired power plants in the <unk> capable of producing about <unk> megawatts of power at a cost of about n million to n million
<unk> <unk> said n it expects to report third earnings of n million to n million or n cents to n cents a share
in the year - ago quarter the designer and operator of cogeneration and waste heat recovery plants had net income of n or four cents a share on revenue of about n million
the company said n the improvement is related to additional cogeneration facilities that have been put into operation
<unk> trans - <unk> flights are <unk> to <unk> and <unk> to <unk>
in a <unk> <unk> article <unk> n the fares were reversed
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said n it had discovered gas offshore <unk>
the well flowed at a rate of n million cubic feet of gas a day through a <unk> <unk> opening at depths between <unk> and <unk> feet
<unk> <unk> is the operator with a <unk> interest in the well
<unk> <unk> <unk> stock rose n cents <unk> to close at <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> composite trading
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said n it formed a n million limited partnership subsidiary n to buy land in <unk> suitable for residential development
the partnership <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is a n joint venture with a trust created by institutional clients of <unk> <unk> <unk> a unit of <unk> <unk> <unk> a real estate advisory management and development company with offices in <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> a home building company declined to identify the institutional investors
the land n to be purchased by the joint venture has n't yet received zoning and other approvals required for development and part of <unk> <unk> job will be to obtain such approvals
the partnership runs the risk that it may not get the approvals for development but in return it can buy land at wholesale rather than retail prices which can result in sizable savings said <unk> <unk> <unk> president and chief executive officer of <unk> <unk>
there are really very few companies that have adequate capital <unk> to buy properties in a raw state for cash
typically developers option property and then once they get the administrative approvals they buy it said <unk> <unk> adding that he believes n the joint venture is the first of its kind
we usually operate in that conservative manner
by setting up the joint venture <unk> <unk> can take the more aggressive approach of buying raw land while avoiding the negative impacts to its own balance sheet <unk> <unk> said <unk>
the company is putting up only n of the capital although it is responsible for providing management planning and processing services to the joint venture
this is one of the best ways <unk> to assure a pipeline of land n to fuel our growth at a minimum risk to our company <unk> <unk> said
when the price of plastics took off in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> went along for the ride
the timing of <unk> chief executive officer <unk> <unk> <unk> appeared to be nothing less than inspired because he had just increased <unk> reliance on plastics
the company outpaced much of the chemical industry as annual profit grew fivefold in two years
<unk> <unk> said of the boom n it going to last a whole lot longer than anybody thinks n
but now prices have nose - dived and <unk> profit is plummeting
some securities analysts are looking for no better than break - even results from the company for the third quarter compared with year - earlier profit of n million or <unk> a share on sales of n million
the stock having lost nearly a quarter of its value since <unk> n closed at n share down n in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> composite trading <unk>
to a degree <unk> represents the new times that have arrived for producers of the so - called commodity plastics that pervade modern life
having just passed through one of the most profitable periods in their history these producers now see their prices eroding
pricing cycles to be sure are nothing new for plastics producers
and the financial decline of some looks steep only in comparison with the heady period that is just behind them
we were all wonderful heroes last year says an executive at one of <unk> competitors
now we at the bottom of the heap
at <unk> which is based in <unk> <unk> the trouble is magnified by the company heavy dependence on plastics
once known as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the company exited the wine and spirits business and plowed more of its resources into plastics after <unk> <unk> took the chief executive job in <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> years old declined to be interviewed for this article but he has consistently argued that over the long haul across both the peaks and the troughs of the plastics market <unk> will prosper through its new direction
<unk> lot is mostly tied to polyethylene resin used to make garbage bags milk jugs housewares toys and meat packaging among other items
in the <unk> polyethylene market <unk> has claimed the largest share about n
but its competitors including <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and several oil giants have much broader business interests and so are better cushioned against price swings
when the price of polyethylene moves a mere penny a pound <unk> annual profit fluctuates by about n cents a share provided <unk> no other variables are changing
in recent months the price of polyethylene even more than that of other commodity plastics has taken a dive
benchmark grades which still sold for as much as n cents a pound last spring have skidded to between <unk> cents and n cents
meanwhile the price of ethylene the chemical building block of polyethylene has n't dropped nearly so fast
that discrepancy hurts <unk> badly because its own plants cover only about half of its ethylene needs
by many accounts an early hint of a price rout in the making came at the start of this year
<unk> which had been putting in huge orders for polyethylene abruptly halted them
calculating that excess polyethylene would soon be sloshing around the world other buyers then bet that prices had peaked and so began to draw down inventories rather than order new product
<unk> <unk> director of <unk> polyethylene business says n producers were surprised to learn how much inventories had swelled throughout the distribution chain as prices spiraled up
people were even hoarding bags he says
now producers hope <unk> prices have hit bottom
they recently announced increases of a few cents a pound <unk> to take effect in the next several weeks
no one knows however whether the new posted prices will stick once producers and customers start to haggle
one doubter is <unk> <unk> a chemical - industry analyst at <unk> <unk> and a bear on plastics stocks
noting others estimates of when price increases can be sustained he remarks n some say <unk>
some say <unk>
i say <unk>
he argues that efforts to firm up prices will be undermined by producers plans to expand production capacity
a quick turnaround is crucial to <unk> because its cash requirements remain heavy
the company is trying to carry out a three - year n billion plant - expansion program started this year
at the same time its annual payments on long - term debt will more than double from a year ago to about n million largely because of debt taken on to pay a n special dividend earlier this year
<unk> described the payout at the time as a way n for it to share the bonanza with its holders because its stock price was n't reflecting the huge profit increases
some analysts saw the payment as an effort also to dispel takeover speculation
whether a cash crunch might eventually force the company to cut its quarterly dividend raised <unk> to n cents a share only a year ago has become a topic of intense speculation on <unk> <unk> since <unk> <unk> deflected dividend questions in a <unk> n meeting with analysts
some viewed his response that company directors review the dividend regularly as nothing more than the standard line from executives
but others came away thinking n he had given something less than his usual straight - from-the-shoulder performance
in any case on the day of the meeting <unk> shares slid <unk> to <unk> in <unk> <unk> trading
on top of everything else <unk> confronts a disaster at its plant in <unk> <unk>
after an explosion idled the plant in <unk> the company progressed in <unk> to within <unk> hours of completing the drawn - out process of restarting it
then a second explosion occurred
two workers died and six remain in the hospital
this human toll adds the most painful dimension yet to the sudden change in <unk> fortunes
until this year the company had been steadily lowering its accident rate and picking up trade - group safety awards
a prolonged production halt at the plant could introduce another imponderable into <unk> financial future
when a plant has just been running flat out to meet demand calculating lost profit and thus claims under business - interruption insurance is straightforward
but the numbers become trickier and subject to dickering between insured and insurer when demand is shifting
you say <unk> you could have sold <unk> percent of this product and <unk> percent of that recalls <unk> <unk> an analyst at <unk> <unk> <unk> who went through this exercise during his former career as a chemical engineer
and then you still have to negotiate
<unk> hopes <unk> the <unk> plant where limited production got under way last week will resume full operation by year end
the plant usually accounts for <unk> to <unk> of <unk> polyethylene production and n of its ethylene production
not everything looks grim for <unk>
the plant expansion should strengthen the company sway in the polyethylene business where market share is often taken through sheer capacity
by lifting ethylene production the expansion will also lower the company raw material costs
<unk> is also tightening its grip on its one large business outside chemicals propane marketing
through a venture with its investment banker <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> completed in <unk> an acquisition of <unk> <unk> in a transaction valued at n billion
petrolane is the second - largest propane distributor in the <unk>
the largest <unk> <unk> was already owned by <unk>
still <unk> has a crisis n to get past right now
some analysts speculate <unk> the weakening stock may yet attract a suitor
the name surfacing in rumors is british <unk> <unk> which is looking to expand its polyethylene business in the <unk>
asked about a bid for <unk> a <unk> spokesman says n we pretty much have a policy of not commenting on rumors and i think n that falls in that category
<unk> <unk> <unk> is disbanding its division responsible for buying network advertising time just a month after moving n of the group n employees to <unk> <unk> from <unk>
a spokesman for the <unk> <unk> - based food and tobacco giant taken private earlier this year in a n billion leveraged buy - out by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> confirmed that it is shutting down the <unk> <unk> <unk> unit and dismissing its <unk> employees in a move to save money
the spokesman said <unk> <unk> is discussing its network - buying plans with its two main advertising firms fcb\/leber <unk> and <unk> <unk>
we found with the size of our media purchases that an ad agency could do just as good a job at significantly lower cost said the spokesman who declined to specify how much <unk> spends on network television time
an executive close to the company said <unk> <unk> is spending about n million on network television time this year down from roughly n million last year
the spokesman said <unk> the broadcast unit will be disbanded <unk> <unk> and the move wo n't affect <unk> print radio and spot - television buying practices
the broadcast group had been based in <unk> <unk> until a year ago when <unk> previous management moved it to <unk> the company headquarters before this summer
one employee with the group said <unk> <unk> moved <unk> employees of the group back to <unk> <unk> in <unk> because there was supposed to be a future
he said n the company hired three more buyers for the unit within the past two weeks wooing them from jobs with advertising agencies
the <unk> spokesman said n the company moved the n employees to <unk> <unk> last month because the group had then been in the midst of purchasing ad time for the networks upcoming season
the studies on closing the unit could n't be completed until now he said
the group president <unk> <unk> was n't in his office <unk> afternoon to comment
the <unk> which is finalizing its steel - import quotas is allocating a larger share of its steel market to developing and newly industrialized countries which have relatively unsubsidized steel industries
meanwhile the <unk> has negotiated a significant cut in <unk> steel quota and made only a minor increase to the steel allotment for the <unk> <unk>
<unk> similar to <unk> and <unk> <unk> is expected to negotiate a somewhat bigger share of the <unk> market than it had under the previous five - year steel quotas which expired <unk> n
<unk> and <unk> are the only two countries that have n't completed steel talks with the <unk> for the year ending <unk> <unk> <unk>
in recent years <unk> steelmakers have supplied about <unk> of the n million tons of steel used annually by the nation
of the remaining n needed the steel - quota negotiations allocate about n to foreign suppliers with the difference supplied mainly by <unk> which is n't included in the quota program
other countries that do n't have formal steel quotas with the <unk> such as <unk> <unk> and <unk> also have supplied steel
some of these countries have in recent years made informal agreements with the <unk> that are similar to quotas
the <unk> administration earlier this year said n it would extend steel quotas known as voluntary restraint agreements until <unk> <unk> <unk>
it also said n it would use that two - and-a-half year period to work toward an international consensus on freeing up the international steel trade which has been notoriously managed subsidized and protected by governments
the <unk> termed its plan a trade liberalization program despite the fact that it is merely an extension
<unk> which was one of the first countries <unk> to conclude its steel talks with the <unk> virtually doubled its quota to <unk> of the <unk> steel market from <unk> under the previous quotas
<unk> <unk> which had n under the previous quotas is set to get a small increase to about n
that increase rises to slightly more than <unk> of the <unk> market if a joint korean - <unk> steel project is included
meanwhile <unk> is expected to increase its allowance from the <unk> share n it has had in recent years
the <unk> and <unk> the <unk> largest steel suppliers have n't been filling their quotas to the full extent
the <unk> steel industry which has been coping with strong european demand has been supplying about <unk> of the <unk> market compared with recent quotas of about <unk>
<unk> has been shipping steel n to total about n of the <unk> market compared with a quota of <unk>
in the recent talks the <unk> had its quota increased about <unk> tons to n of the <unk> market from <unk> in <unk>
but its quota has been as high as <unk> in <unk>
<unk> however has agreed to cut its quota to about <unk> from <unk> previously
<unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> provide about <unk> of the steel imported to the <unk> under the quota program
the balance is supplied by a host of smaller exporters such as <unk> and <unk>
the <unk> had about an extra n of the domestic steel market n to give to foreign suppliers in its quota talks
that was essentially made up of a <unk> increase in the overall quota program and <unk> from cutting <unk> allowance
negotiators from the <unk> <unk> trade office will repeat these quota negotiations next year when they will have another n of the <unk> steel market n to allocate
these optional <unk> increases to the steel quota program are built into the <unk> administration steel - quota program to give its negotiators leverage with foreign steel suppliers <unk> to try to get them to withdraw subsidies and protectionism from their own steel industries
<unk> <unk> expects fiscal second - quarter earnings to trail n results but anticipates that several new products will lead to a much stronger performance in its second half
<unk> a telecommunications company had net income of n or five cents a share in its year - earlier second quarter ended <unk> n
revenue totaled n million
<unk> <unk> chairman and chief executive officer said in an interview that earnings in the most recent quarter will be about two cents a share on revenue of just under n million
the lower results <unk> <unk> said <unk> reflect a <unk> decline in industry sales of privately owned pay telephones <unk> primary business
although <unk> <unk> expects that line of business to strengthen in the next year he said <unk> <unk> will also benefit from moving into other areas
<unk> among those is the company entrance into the public facsimile business <unk> <unk> said <unk>
within the next year <unk> expects to place <unk> fax machines made by <unk> in <unk> in hotels municipal buildings drugstores and other public settings around the country
<unk> will provide a credit - card reader n for the machines to collect store and forward billing data
<unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> should realize a minimum of n of recurring net earnings for each machine each month
<unk> has also developed an automatic call processor that will make further use of the company system for automating and handling credit - card calls and collect calls
automatic call processors will provide that system for virtually any telephone <unk> <unk> said <unk> not just phones produced by <unk>
the company will also be producing a new line of convenience telephones which do n't accept coins for use in hotel lobbies office lobbies hospitality lounges and similar settings
<unk> <unk> estimated that the processors and convenience phones would produce about n of recurring net earnings for each machine each month
<unk> retail price index rose <unk> in <unk> from <unk> and was up <unk> for the year the <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> said n it adopted a shareholders rights plan in which rights to purchase shares of common stock will be distributed as a dividend to shareholders of record as of <unk> n
the company said n the plan was n't adopted in response to any known offers for <unk> a maker and marketer of hospital products
the rights allow shareholders to purchase <unk> stock at a discount if any person or group acquires more than <unk> of the company common stock or announces a tender offer
measuring cups may soon be replaced by tablespoons in the laundry room
<unk> <unk> <unk> plans to begin testing next month a superconcentrated detergent that will require only a few spoonfuls per washload
the move stems from lessons learned in <unk> where local competitors have had phenomenal success with concentrated soapsuds
it also marks <unk> growing concern that its japanese rivals such as <unk> <unk> may bring their superconcentrates to the <unk>
the <unk> consumer - products giant got clobbered two years ago in <unk> when <unk> introduced a powerful detergent called <unk> which quickly won a <unk> stake in the japanese markets
they do n't want to get caught again says one industry watcher
retailers in <unk> <unk> say <unk> <unk> new powdered detergent n to be called <unk> with <unk> <unk> will be on shelves in that market by early <unk>
a <unk> spokeswoman confirmed that shipments to <unk> started late last month
she said n the company will study results from this market before expanding to others
superconcentrates are n't entirely new for <unk>
the company introduced a superconcentrated <unk> <unk> in <unk> after watching the success of <unk>
when <unk> hit the shelves in <unk> <unk> share of the japanese market fell to about n from more than <unk>
with the help of <unk> <unk> <unk> share is now estimated to be n
while the japanese have embraced the compact packaging and convenience of concentrated products the true test for <unk> will be in the <unk> billion <unk> detergent market where growth is slow and liquids have gained prominence over powders
the company may have chosen to market the product under the <unk> name since it already expanded its best - selling <unk> into <unk> different varieties including this year big hit <unk> with <unk>
with superconcentrates however it is n't always easy to persuade consumers that less is more many people tend to dump too much detergent into the washing machine believing that it takes a cup of powder to really clean the laundry
in the early n <unk> tried to launch here a concentrated detergent under the <unk> brand name that it markets in <unk>
but the product which was n't as concentrated as the new <unk> bombed in a market test in <unk> and was dropped
<unk> and others also have tried repeatedly to hook consumers on detergent and fabric softener combinations in pouches but they have n't sold well despite the convenience
but <unk> contends n the new <unk> is a unique formula that also offers an ingredient that prevents colors from fading
and retailers are expected to embrace the product in part because it will take up less shelf space
when shelf space was cheap bigger was better says <unk> <unk> an analyst at <unk> <unk>
but with so many brands vying for space that no longer the case
if the new <unk> sells well the trend toward smaller packaging is likely to accelerate as competitors follow with their own superconcentrates
then retailers will probably push the less - established brands out altogether he says n
competition is bound to get tougher if <unk> introduces a product like <unk> in the <unk>
to be sure <unk> would n't have an easy time taking <unk> market share away from the mighty <unk> which has about <unk> of the market
<unk> officials previously have said n they are interested in selling detergents in the <unk> but so far the company has focused on acquisitions such as last year purchase of <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> hand - lotion maker
it also has a product - testing facility in <unk>
some believe <unk> <unk> interest in a superconcentrated detergent goes beyond the concern for the japanese
this is something <unk> <unk> would do with or without <unk> says <unk> <unk>
with economic tension between the <unk> and <unk> worsening many japanese had feared last week visit from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
they expected a new barrage of demands that <unk> do something quickly to reduce its trade surplus with the <unk>
instead they got a discussion of the need for the <unk> and <unk> to work together and of the importance of the long - term view
<unk> <unk> first trip to <unk> as <unk> chief trade negotiator had a completely different tone from last month visit by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> called for concrete results by next spring in negotiations over fundamental japanese business practices that supposedly inhibit free trade
he said n such results should be measurable in dollars and cents in reducing the <unk> trade deficit with <unk>
but <unk> <unk> speaking at a breakfast meeting of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> in <unk> on <unk> stressed that the objective is not to get definitive action by spring or summer it is rather to have a blueprint for action
she added that she expected perhaps to have a down payment some small step n to convince the american people and the japanese people that we moving in earnest
how such remarks translate into policy wo n't become clear for months
american and japanese officials offered several theories for the difference in approach betwen <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
many called it simply a contrast in styles
but some saw it as a classic negotiating tactic
others said <unk> the <unk> administration may feel n the rhetoric on both sides is getting out of hand
and some said n it reflected the growing debate in <unk> over pursuing free trade with <unk> versus some kind of managed trade
asked to compare her visit to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> replied n i did n't hear every word n he spoke but as a general proposition i think n we have a very consistent trade strategy in the <unk> administration
yet more than one american official who sat in with her during three days of talks with japanese officials said n her tone often was surprisingly conciliatory
i think n my line has been very consistent <unk> <unk> said at a news conference <unk> afternoon
i am painted sometimes as ferocious perhaps because i have a ferocious list of statutes n to implement
i do n't feel very ferocious
i do n't feel either hard or soft
i feel committed to the program of opening markets and expanding trade
when she met the local press for the first time on <unk> <unk> <unk> firmly reiterated the need for progress in removing barriers to trade in forest products satellites and supercomputers three areas targeted under the <unk> <unk> provision of the n trade bill
she highlighted exclusionary business practices that the <unk> government has identified
but her main thrust was to promote the importance of world - wide free trade and open competition
she said n the trade imbalance was mainly due to macroeconomic factors and should n't be tackled by setting quantitative targets
at her news conference for japanese reporters one economics journalist summed up the japanese sense of relief
my impression was that you would be a scary old lady he said drawing a few nervous chuckles from his colleagues
but i am relieved to see that you are beautiful and gentle and intelligent and a person of integrity
<unk> <unk> remarks did raise questions at least among some <unk> officials about what exactly her stance is on <unk> access to the japanese semiconductor market
the <unk> share of the japanese market has been stuck around <unk> for years
many americans have interpreted a n agreement as assuring <unk> companies a n share by <unk> but the japanese have denied making any such promise
at one of her news conferences <unk> <unk> said n i believe n we can do much better than <unk>
but she stressed n i am against managed trade
i will not enter into an agreement that stipulates to a percentage of the market
<unk> industries <unk> said n it expects to report a net loss for the fourth quarter that ended <unk> <unk> and is seeking new financing
the seller of photographic products and services said <unk> it is considering a number of financing alternatives including seeking increases in its credit lines
traditional declined to estimate the amount of the loss and would n't say if it expects to show a profit for the year
in the year ended <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> reported net income of n million or <unk> a share
the company did n't break out its fourth - quarter results
in the latest nine months net income was n million or <unk> a share on revenue of n million
separately the company said n it would file a delayed fiscal - year report with the securities and <unk> <unk> within approximately n days
it said <unk> the delay resulted from difficulties in resolving its accounting of a settlement with the <unk> <unk> <unk>
under an agreement filed in federal court in <unk> to settle <unk> objections to some traditional sales practices <unk> said n it would establish a <unk> trust fund n to provide refunds to certain customers
<unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> it was sued by a buyer of its computerized newspaper - publishing system alleging that the company failed to correct deficiencies in the system
a spokesman for <unk> <unk> said n the lawsuit by two units of <unk> communications <unk> seeks restitution of the system about n million purchase price and cancellation of a software license provided by the <unk> units to <unk> <unk> for alleged failure to pay royalties
<unk> <unk> said <unk> it believes that the complaints filed in federal court in <unk> are without merit
closely held <unk> communications is based in <unk> <unk>
the units that filed the suit are <unk> newspapers <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> completed the sale of its <unk> <unk> <unk> subsidiary a men luxury haberdashery to <unk> investments
terms were n't disclosed
as <unk> core business of off - price retailing grows a small subsidiary that is operationally unrelated becomes a difficult distraction said <unk> <unk> president of the parent in a statement
a spokeswoman said <unk> <unk> operates a total of seven stores in the <unk> and overseas
<unk> operates n off - price apparel stores in the <unk>
the oil industry middling profits could persist through the rest of the year
major oil companies in the next few days are expected to report much less robust earnings than they did for the third quarter a year ago largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profitability
the gasoline picture may improve this quarter but chemicals are likely to remain weak industry executives and analysts say n reducing chances that profits could equal their year - earlier performance
the industry is seeing a softening somewhat in volume and certainly in price in petrochemicals <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> in an interview
that change will obviously impact third and fourth quarter earnings for the industry in general he added n
he did n't forecast <unk> results
but securities analysts say <unk> <unk> will be among the companies hard - hit by weak chemical prices and will probably post a drop in third - quarter earnings
so too many analysts predict <unk> will <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
typical is what happened to the price of ethylene a major commodity chemical produced in vast amounts by many oil companies
it has plunged n since <unk> to around <unk> cents a pound
a year ago ethylene sold for n cents peaking at about n cents last <unk>
a big reason for the chemical price retreat is overexpansion
beginning in <unk> prices began accelerating as a growing <unk> economy and the weak dollar spurred demand
companies added capacity furiously
now greatly increased supplies are on the market while the dollar is stronger and domestic economic growth is slower
third - quarter profits from gasoline were weaker
refining margins were so good in the third quarter of last year and generally not very good this year said <unk> <unk> a securities analyst at <unk> <unk> <unk>
oil company refineries ran flat out to prepare for a robust holiday driving season in <unk> and <unk> that did n't materialize
the excess supply pushed gasoline prices down in that period
in addition crude oil prices were up some from a year earlier further pressuring profitability
refiners say <unk> margins picked up in <unk> and many industry officials believe <unk> gasoline profits will rebound this quarter though still not to the level of <unk> fourth quarter
during the <unk> second half many companies posted record gasoline and chemical profits
crude oil production may turn out to be the most surprising element of companies earnings this year
prices averaging roughly <unk> a barrel higher in the third quarter than a year earlier have stayed well above most companies expectations
demand has been much stronger than anticipated and it typically accelerates in the fourth quarter
we could see higher oil prices this year said <unk> <unk> an analyst at <unk> <unk>
that will translate into sharply higher production profits particularly compared with last year when oil prices steadily fell to below <unk> a barrel in the fourth quarter
while oil prices have been better than expected natural gas prices have been worse
in the third quarter they averaged about <unk> less than they were in n
the main reason remains weather
last summer was notable for a heat wave and drought that caused utilities to burn more natural gas to feed increased electrical demand from air conditioning use
this summer on the other hand had milder weather than usual
we been very disappointed in the performance of natural gas prices said <unk> <unk> <unk> president
the lagging gas price is not going to assist fourth quarter performance as many had expected n
going into the fourth quarter natural gas prices are anywhere from <unk> to n lower than a year earlier
for instance natural gas currently produced along the <unk> <unk> is selling on the spot market for around <unk> a thousand cubic feet down <unk> from <unk> a thousand cubic feet a year ago
the <unk> administration trying to blunt growing demands from <unk> <unk> for a relaxation of controls on exports to the <unk> bloc is questioning whether <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> supplied militarily valuable technology to the soviets
most of the western european members of <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> the unofficial forum through which the <unk> and its allies align their export - control policies are expected to argue for more liberal export rules at a meeting n to be held in <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
they plan to press specifically for a relaxation of rules governing exports of machine tools computers and other high - technology products
but the <unk> administration says <unk> it wants to see evidence that all <unk> members are complying fully with existing export - control procedures before it will support further liberalization
to make its point it is challenging the italian government to explain reports that <unk> may have supplied the <unk> <unk> with sophisticated computer - driven devices that could be used to build parts for combat aircraft
the <unk> <unk> <unk> which first reported the <unk> concerns cited a <unk> intelligence report as the source of the allegations that <unk> exported n million in embargoed state - of-the-art flexible manufacturing systems to the soviet aviation industry
<unk> reportedly began shipping these tools in <unk>
a <unk> <unk> spokesman acknowledged that the <unk> is discussing the allegations with the italian government and <unk> but declined to confirm any details
italian <unk> <unk> <unk> promised a quick investigation into whether <unk> broke <unk> rules
<unk> <unk> called his attention to the matter during the italian leader visit here last week
<unk> has denied that it violated <unk> rules asserting that the reported shipments were properly licensed by the italian authorities
although the legality of these sales is still an open question the disclosure could n't be better timed to support the position of export - control hawks in the <unk> and the intelligence community
it seems to me that a story like this breaks just before every important <unk> meeting said a <unk> lobbyist for a number of <unk> computer companies
the <unk> administration has sent conflicting signals about its export - control policies reflecting unhealed divisions among several competing agencies
last summer <unk> <unk> moved the administration in the direction of gradual liberalization when he told a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> meeting that he would allow some exceptions to the <unk> embargo of strategic goods
but more recently the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> openly feuded over the extent to which <unk> should liberalize exports of personal computers to the bloc
however these agencies generally agree that the <unk> should be cautious about any further liberalization
there no evidence that the soviet program n to illegally acquire western technology has diminished said a <unk> <unk> spokesman
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a british subsidiary of <unk> <unk> announced n it will issue warrants on shares of <unk> <unk> telecommunications <unk>
the move closely follows a similar offer by <unk> of warrants for shares of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
under the latest offer <unk> $ n million us$ n million of three - year warrants will be issued in <unk> each giving buyers the right to buy one <unk> <unk> telecommunications share at a price n to be determined <unk>
the n million warrants will be priced at <unk> $ n each and are expected to carry a premium to the share price of about <unk>
in trading on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> the shares closed <unk> at <unk> $ n each
at this price the shares would have to rise above <unk> $ n for subscribers to <unk> issue to profitably convert their warrants
while <unk> <unk> companies have in the past issued warrants on their own shares <unk> warrants are the first here <unk> to be issued by a third party
<unk> will cover the warrants by buying sufficient shares or options n to purchase shares n to cover its entire position
bankers said n warrants for <unk> <unk> stocks are attractive because they give foreign investors wary of volatility in the colony stock market an opportunity to buy shares without taking too great a risk
the <unk> <unk> telecommunications warrants should be attractive to buyers in <unk> the bankers added n because the group is one of a handful of blue - chip stocks on the <unk> <unk> market that has international appeal
<unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> filed suit against former stock speculator <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> charging <unk> they defrauded the thrift by concealing their relationship when persuading it to buy n million in high - yield high - risk junk bonds
in a suit filed in federal court <unk> the s&l alleged that a disproportionate number of the bonds n it purchased in <unk> declined in value
<unk> <unk> purchased the bonds the suit alleged <unk> after <unk> <unk> and <unk> negotiated an agreement for <unk> hotels to purchase a <unk> stake in the thrift for about n million
<unk> <unk> was controlled by <unk> <unk> who currently is serving a prison term for securities violations
officials at <unk> said n they had n't seen the suit and thus could n't comment
in addition to n million compensatory damages the suit seeks n million in punitive damages
also named in the suit is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> the successor company to <unk> hotels
<unk> officials could n't be located
<unk> <unk> said <unk> it agreed to buy the bonds after a representative of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> visited it in <unk> <unk> and said <unk> <unk> <unk> could improve its financial condition by purchasing the bonds
shortly before the visit <unk> <unk> and <unk> representives had met with <unk> <unk> officials and had signed a letter of intent to acquire the <unk> stake in the company
however the agreement was canceled in <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> purchased the bonds in at least n different transactions in <unk> and since then has realized n million in losses on them the company said n
<unk> <unk> industries <unk> said <unk> its directors reached an agreement in principle calling for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to combine its <unk> american cement holdings with <unk> in a transaction that will leave <unk> minority shareholders with n of the combined company
<unk> the <unk> american holding company of swiss concern <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> previously proposed combining its <unk> stake in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and its <unk> stake in <unk> <unk> <unk> with its <unk> stake in <unk>
but <unk> first offer would have given <unk> other shareholders about n of the combined company
ideal directors rejected that offer although they said n they endorsed the merger proposal
under the agreement <unk> will own <unk> of the combined company
<unk> current operations will represent about n of the combined company
the transaction is subject to a definitive agreement and approval by <unk> shareholders
<unk> said n it expects to complete the transaction early next year
while corn and soybean prices have slumped well below their drought - induced peaks of n wheat prices remain stubbornly high
and they likely to stay that way for months <unk> to come analysts say n
for one thing even with many farmers planting more winter wheat this year than last tight wheat supplies are likely to support prices well into <unk> the analysts say n
and if rain does n't fall soon across many of the <unk> plains wheat - growing areas yields in the crop now being planted could be reduced further squeezing supplies
also supporting prices are expectations that the <unk> <unk> will place substantial buying orders over the next few months
by next <unk> <unk> stocks of <unk> wheat n to be carried over into the next season before the winter wheat now being planted is harvested are projected to drop to n million bushels
that would be the lowest level since the early n
stocks were n million bushels on <unk> n of this year
in response to dwindling domestic supplies <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> last month said <unk> the <unk> government would slightly increase the number of acres n farmers can plant in wheat for next year and still qualify for federal support payments
the government estimates that the new plan will boost production next year by about n million bushels
it now estimates production for next year at just under n billion bushels compared with this year estimated n billion and a drought - stunted n billion in <unk>
but the full effect on prices of the winter wheat now being planted wo n't be felt until the second half of next year
until then limited stocks are likely to keep prices near the <unk> level analysts say n
on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> wheat for <unk> delivery settled at <unk> a bushel unchanged
in theory at least tight supplies next spring could leave the wheat futures market susceptible to a supply - demand squeeze said <unk> <unk> a futures analyst with <unk> <unk> in <unk>
such a situation can wreak havoc as was shown by the emergency that developed in soybean futures trading this summer on the <unk> <unk> of <unk>
in <unk> the <unk> ordered <unk> <unk> <unk> a. to liquidate futures positions equal to about n million bushels of soybeans
the exchange said <unk> it feared that some members would n't be able to find enough soybeans to deliver and would have to default on their contractual obligation to the italian conglomerate which had refused requests to reduce its holdings
<unk> has denied n it was trying to manipulate the soybean futures market
unseasonably hot dry weather across large portions of the <unk> plains and in wheat - growing areas in <unk> and <unk> is threatening to reduce the yield from this season winter wheat crop said <unk> <unk> <unk> a futures analyst and head of <unk> <unk> in <unk>
for example in the <unk> panhandle n or more of the topsoil is short of moisture
that figure climbs to about n in wheat - growing portions of <unk> he said n
the <unk> <unk> has n't given any clear indication of its wheat purchase plans but many analysts expect <unk> to place sizable orders for <unk> wheat in the next few months further supporting prices
wheat prices will increasingly pivot off of soviet demand in coming weeks predicted <unk> <unk> <unk> vice president research for <unk> <unk> in <unk>
looking ahead to other commodity markets this week
<unk> <unk> traders will be watching to see how long and how far the price decline that began <unk> will go
late <unk> after the close of trading the market received what would normally have been a bullish <unk> <unk> of <unk> estimate of the <unk> <unk> orange crop
it was near the low range of estimates at n million n boxes compared with n million boxes last season
however as expected <unk> waited for the crop estimate to come out and then cut the export price of its juice concentrate to about <unk> a pound from around <unk>
<unk> consequent selling of futures contracts erased whatever supportive effect the <unk> report might have had and sent the <unk> orange juice contract down as much as n cents a pound at one time
it settled with a loss of <unk> cents at <unk> a pound
brazilian juice after a delay caused by drought at the start of its crop season is beginning to arrive in the <unk> in large quantities
<unk> wants to stimulate demand for its product which is going to be in plentiful supply
the price cut one analyst said <unk> appeared to be aimed even more at <unk> where consumption of brazilian juice has fallen
it a dollar - priced product and the strong dollar has made it more expensive in <unk> the analyst said <unk>
<unk> <unk> futures prices have dropped significantly from more than <unk> a pound at midyear
barring a cold snap or other crop problems in the growing areas downward pressure on prices is likely to continue into <unk> when harvesting and processing of oranges in <unk> reach their peak the analyst said <unk>
although some analysts look for profit - taking in the wake of <unk> <unk> in crude oil prices last week rally is generally expected to continue this week
i would continue to look for a stable crude market at least in futures trading said <unk> <unk> an energy futures broker with <unk> <unk>
<unk> capped a week of steadily rising crude oil prices in both futures and spot markets
on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> crude for <unk> delivery finished at <unk> a barrel up n cents on the day
on european markets meanwhile spot prices of <unk> <unk> crudes were up <unk> to n cents a barrel
this market still wants to go higher said <unk> <unk> a first vice president at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
he predicted that the <unk> contract will reach <unk> a barrel or more on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
there has been little news <unk> to account for such buoyancy in the oil markets
analysts generally cite a lack of bearish developments as well as rumors of a possible tightening of supplies of some fuels and crudes
there also are recurring reports that the <unk> <unk> is having difficulties with its oil exports and that <unk> has about reached its production limit and ca n't produce as much as it could sell
many traders foresee a tightening of near - term supplies particularly of high - quality crudes such as those produced in the <unk> <unk> and in <unk>
if a hostile predator emerges for <unk> <unk> <unk> co - founders <unk> and <unk> <unk> will lead a management buy - out attempt an official close to the company said n
financing for any takeover attempt may be problematic in the wake of <unk> stock - market sell - off in <unk> <unk> and turmoil in the junk - bond market
but the beleaguered british advertising and consulting giant which last week named a new chief executive officer <unk> to replace <unk> <unk> has been the subject of intense takeover speculation for weeks
last week <unk> largest shareholder <unk> <unk> <unk> said n it had been approached by one or more third parties interested in a possible restructuring
and <unk> <unk> chief executive officer of <unk> big <unk> <unk> <unk> advertising unit said <unk> he had offered to lead a management buy - out of the company but was rebuffed by <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> said n he would n't launch a hostile bid
the executive close to <unk> <unk> said that if a bidder came up with a ludicrously high offer a crazy offer which <unk> knew <unk> it could n't beat it would have no choice but to recommend it to shareholders
but otherwise it would undoubtedly come back with an offer by management
the executive said n any buy - out would be led by the current board whose chairman is <unk> <unk> and whose strategic guiding force is believed to be <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is n't part of the board nor are any of the other heads of <unk> big u.s.-based ad agencies
the executive did n't name any price but securities analysts have said <unk> <unk> would fetch upward of <unk> billion
the executive denied speculation that <unk> was bringing in the new chief executive officer only to clean up the company financially so that the brothers could lead a buy - back
that speculation abounded <unk> as industry executives analyzed the appointment of the new chief executive <unk> <unk> - <unk> who joins <unk> and becomes a member of its board on <unk> n
<unk> <unk> - <unk> formerly chief executive of the pharmaceutical research firm <unk> <unk> <unk> has a reputation as a savvy financial manager and will be charged largely with repairing <unk> poor financial state

he was brought in to turn around the company
separately several <unk> agency clients said n they believe n the company management shakeup will have little affect on them
it has n't had any impact on us nor do we expect it to said a spokeswoman for <unk> <unk> <unk> a major client of <unk> <unk>

newspaper publishers are reporting mixed third - quarter results aided by favorable newsprint prices and hampered by flat or declining advertising linage especially in the <unk>
adding to unsteadiness in the industry seasonal retail ad spending patterns in newspapers have been upset by shifts in ownership and general hardships within the retail industry
in <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> department stores have filed for protection from creditors under chapter n of the federal <unk> <unk> while the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> department - store chains are for sale
many papers throughout the country are also faced with a slowdown in classified - ad spending a booming category for newspapers in recent years
until recently industry analysts believed n decreases in retail ad spending had bottomed out and would in fact increase in this year third and fourth quarters
all bets are off analysts say <unk> because of the shifting ownership of the retail chains
improved paper prices will help offset weakness in linage but the retailers problems have affected the amount of ad linage n they usually run said <unk> <unk> <unk> industry analyst for <unk> <unk> <unk>
retailers are just in disarray
for instance <unk> <unk> posted an n gain in net income as total ad pages dropped at <unk> <unk> but advertising revenue rose because of a higher circulation rate base and increased rates
<unk> <unk> daily and n non - daily newspapers reported a n increase in advertising and circulation revenue
total advertising linage was modestly lower as classified - ad volume increased while there was softer demand for retail and national ad linage said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> chief executive officer
at <unk> <unk> ad pages totaled <unk> for the quarter down n from the n period which was helped by increased ad spending from the <unk> olympics
while <unk> <unk> total paid ad pages for the year to date totaled <unk> a decrease of n from last year the paper ad revenue increased <unk> in the quarter and n in the nine months
in the nine months <unk> net rose <unk> to n million or <unk> a share from n million or <unk> a share
revenue gained <unk> to n billion from n billion
at <unk> <unk> <unk> third - quarter net income fell n from the year - earlier period
net fell to n million or n cents a share from n million or n cents a share
the year - earlier period included a one - time gain of <unk> million or four cents a share
revenue gained <unk> to n million from n million
the drop in profit reflected in part continued softness in financial advertising at the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> magazine
ad linage at the <unk> fell <unk> in the third quarter
<unk> <unk> <unk> reversed a year - earlier third quarter net loss
the publisher of the <unk> <unk> reported net of n million or n cents a share compared with a loss of n million or n cents a share for the third quarter in <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> the parent chairman and chief executive officer said <unk> earnings continued to be hurt by softness in ad volume at the <unk> newspaper
third - quarter profit estimates for several companies are being strongly affected by the price of newsprint which in the last two years has had several price increases
after a supply crunch caused prices to rise n since <unk> to n a metric ton analysts are encouraged because they do n't expect a price increase for the rest of this year
companies with daily newspapers in the <unk> will need the stable newsprint prices to ease damage from weak ad linage
<unk> <unk> at <unk> <unk> said <unk> he estimates that <unk> <unk> <unk> earnings were down for the third quarter because of soft advertising levels at its <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> newspapers
trouble on the <unk> <unk> was likely offset by improved ad linage at the <unk> <unk> <unk> which this week also unveiled a redesign
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is expected to report lower earnings for the third quarter because of continued weak advertising levels at its flagship <unk> <unk> <unk> and deep discounting of newsprint at its affiliate <unk> products <unk>
<unk> <unk> regional daily newspapers are holding up well but there is little sign that things will improve in the <unk> <unk> market said <unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> is expected to report improved earnings largely because of increased cable revenue and publishing revenue helped by an improved retail market in the <unk> area
according to analysts profits were also helped by successful cost - cutting measures at <unk>
the news - weekly has faced heightened competition from rival <unk> magazine and a relatively flat magazine advertising market
<unk> - <unk> <unk> is faced with continued uncertainty over the pending joint operating agreement between its <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and has told analysts that earnings were down in the third quarter
however analysts point to positive advertising spending at several of its major daily newspapers such as the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>

<unk> motors <unk> in a series of moves that angered union officials in the <unk> and <unk> has signaled that as many as five north american assembly plants may not survive the n as the corporation struggles to cut its excess vehicle - making capacity
in announcements to workers late last week <unk> effectively signed death notices for two full - sized van assembly plants and cast serious doubt on the futures of three <unk> car factories
<unk> is under intense pressure to close factories that became unprofitable as the giant auto maker <unk> market share skidded during the past decade
the company currently using about <unk> of its <unk> american vehicle capacity has vowed <unk> it will run at <unk> of capacity by <unk>
just a month ago <unk> announced n it would make an aging assembly plant in <unk> <unk> the eighth <unk> assembly facility <unk> to close since <unk>
now <unk> appears to be stepping up the pace of its factory consolidation to get in shape for the <unk>
one reason is mounting competition from new japanese car plants in the <unk> that are pouring out more than one million vehicles a year at costs lower than <unk> can match
another is that <unk> <unk> workers union officials have signaled n they want tighter no - layoff provisions in the new <unk> <unk> national contract that will be negotiated next year
<unk> officials want to get their strategy n to reduce capacity and the work force in place before those talks begin
the problem however is that <unk> moves are coming at a time when <unk> leaders are trying to silence dissidents who charge n the union is too passive in the face of <unk> layoffs
against that backdrop <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who recently became head of the union <unk> department issued a statement <unk> blasting <unk> flagrant insensitivity toward union members
the auto maker decision to let word of the latest shutdowns and product reassignments trickle out in separate communiques to the affected plants showed disarray and an inability or unwillingness to provide consistent information <unk> <unk> said <unk>
<unk> officials told workers late last week of the following moves <unk> of full - sized vans will be consolidated into a single plant in <unk> <unk>
that means n two plants one in <unk> <unk> and the other in <unk> <unk> probably will be shut down after the end of <unk>
the shutdowns will idle about <unk> canadian assembly workers and about n workers in <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> workers union president used the impending <unk> shutdown to criticize the <unk> free trade agreement and its champion <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
but canadian auto workers may benefit from a separate <unk> move that affects three <unk> car plants and one in <unk>
workers at plants in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> were told n their facilities are no longer being considered to build the next generation of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> muscle cars
<unk> is studying whether it can build the new <unk> - <unk> profitably at a plant in <unk> <unk> <unk> company and union officials said n
that announcement left union officials in <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> uncertain about their futures
the <unk> <unk> plant which employs about <unk> workers does n't have a product n to build after <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> local president said <unk> the facility was asked to draw up plans to continue working as a flex plant which could build several different types of products on short notice to satisfy demand
at the <unk> <unk> plant which employs about <unk> workers building the eight - year-old a - body mid - sized cars <unk> <unk> <unk> local vice president said n the plant has no new product lined up and <unk> none of us knows when the <unk> - body cars will die
he said <unk> he believes <unk> <unk> has plans to keep building a - body cars into the n
at <unk> however the <unk> - <unk> decision appears to erase <unk> hopes that <unk> would reopen the shuttered assembly plant that last built the plastic - bodied two - seater <unk> fiero model
the <unk> plant was viewed as a model of union - management cooperation at <unk> before slow sales of the <unk> forced the company to close the factory last year
<unk> officials have taken a beating politically as a result
dissident <unk> members have used the fiero plant as a symbol of labor - management cooperation failure
<unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> said <unk> the canadian government raised an obstacle to its proposed acquisition of <unk> <unk> <unk> for n million canadian dollars <unk> n million
<unk> said <unk> the government minister of industry science and technology told it that he was n't convinced that the purchase is likely to be of net benefit to <unk>
canadian investment rules require that big foreign takeovers meet that standard
the french company said <unk> the government gave it n days in which to submit information n to further support its takeover plan
both <unk> and <unk> are biotechnology research and vaccine manufacturing concerns
the government action was unusual
<unk> <unk> executive vice president of <unk> <unk> which oversees foreign takeovers said n it marked the first time in its four - year history that the agency has made an adverse net - benefit decision about the acquisition of a publicly traded company
he said n it has reached the same conclusions about some attempts to buy closely held concerns but eventually allowed those acquisitions to proceed
this is n't a change in government policy this provision has been used before said <unk> <unk> press secretary for <unk> <unk> <unk> minister of industry science and technology
<unk> <unk> issued the ruling based on a recommendation by <unk> <unk>
spokesmen for <unk> and <unk> said n they had n't been informed of specific areas of concern by either the government or <unk> <unk> but added n they hope to have more information early this week
<unk> <unk> declined to comment on the reasons for the government decision
<unk> <unk> a partner with <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> - based pharmaceutical industry research firm said <unk> the government ruling was n't unexpected
this has become a very politicized deal concerning <unk> only large world - class bio - research or pharmaceutical company <unk> <unk> said
<unk> <unk> said n the move that could allow the transaction to go ahead as planned could be an out - of-court settlement of <unk> dispute with the <unk> of <unk>
the <unk> is seeking to block the acquisition of <unk> by foreign interests citing concerns about the amount of research that would be done in <unk>
the university is considering a settlement proposal made by <unk>
while neither side will disclose its contents <unk> <unk> expects it to contain more specific guarantees on research and development spending levels in <unk> than <unk> offered to <unk> <unk>
some analysts such as <unk> <unk> of <unk> - based <unk> <unk> <unk> believe <unk> the government ruling leaves the door open for other bidders such as <unk> <unk> - <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
officials for the two concerns which are bidding <unk> <unk> a share for <unk> could n't be reached for comment
french state - owned <unk> - <unk> <unk> holds <unk> of <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> said n it canceled plans for a preferred - stock swap but may resume payment of dividends on the stock and added that it expects to publicly offer about n million common shares
the company said n it planned to offer an undetermined number of common shares in exchange for the <unk> shares of its preferred stock outstanding
the exchange ratio was never established
<unk> said n market conditions led to the cancellation of the planned exchange
the energy - services concern said however that in <unk> n it may resume payments of dividends on the preferred stock

earnings for most of the nation major pharmaceutical makers are believed to have moved ahead briskly in the third quarter as companies with newer big - selling prescription drugs fared especially well

less robust earnings at <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> were attributed to those companies older products many of which face stiffening competition from generic drugs and other medicines
<unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk> <unk> said that over the past few years most drug makers have shed their slow - growing businesses and instituted other cost savings such as consolidating manufacturing plants and administrative staffs
as a result major new products are having significant impact even on a company with very large revenues <unk> <unk> said <unk>

<unk> biggest - selling drugs are <unk> a tranquilizer and <unk> a sedative
sales of both drugs have been hurt by new state laws restricting the prescriptions of certain tranquilizing medicines and adverse publicity about the excessive use of the drugs

the <unk> has a wonderful botanical garden a great zoo its own charming <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> and of course the yankees
however most people having been subjected to news footage of the devastated <unk> <unk> look at the borough the way <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> did in <unk> of the vanities as a wrong turn into hell
but <unk> <unk> <unk> her childhood <unk> of the <unk> is something else altogether
in a lovely novelistic memoir sleeping arrangements <unk> <unk> pages n she remembers an exotic playground peopled mainly by jewish eccentrics and the occasional <unk> real oddballs like her sexpot friend the hell - kitten <unk> age five
<unk> <unk> a novelist and playwright has a vivid and dramatically outsized sense of recall
she transforms her <unk> of the emotions a place where the flats of mediocrity are only relieved by steep descents into hysteria into the babylonian <unk> a world simmering with sex and death and intrigue
in the babylonian <unk> <unk> working - class people lived in drab soviet - style buildings glamorized with names like <unk> <unk> after owners <unk> and <unk> <unk> whose lobbies and hallways were decorated with murals of ancient syrians and greeks friezes of <unk>
for <unk> <unk> the architectural discombobulation matched the discrepancy n she felt living in the <unk> <unk> as a little girl outwardly ordinary inwardly ornate owing all inspiration to heathen cultures
<unk> - witted and funny but never mean she a memorialist a bit like <unk> <unk> if he been jewish and female and less bitchy
little <unk> as <unk> <unk> calls herself in the book really was n't ordinary
she was raised for the first eight years by her mother <unk> whom she remembers as a loving liar who realigned history to explain why <unk> father did n't live with them
<unk> reinvented this man who may or may not have known about his child as a war hero for <unk> benefit
<unk> died young and <unk> has remembered her as a romantic figure who did n't interfere much with her child education on the streets
the games <unk> <unk> children played holding kids down and stripping them for example seem tame by today crack standards but <unk> <unk> makes it all sound like a great adventure
without official knowledge of sex or death we flirted with both she writes
she analyzed families by their sleeping arrangements
her friend <unk> whose parents kept reminding her <unk> she was unwanted slept on a narrow bed wedged into her parents bedroom as though she were a temporary visitor
her friend <unk> father was a professional thief they did n't seem to have any bedrooms at all
maybe <unk> became so obsessed with where people slept and how because her own arrangements kept shifting
when <unk> died her uncles moved in and let her make the sleeping and other household arrangements
they painted the apartment orange pink and white according to her instructions
with loving detail she recalls her <unk> <unk> an <unk> <unk> and song lyricist who rhymed river with liver in a love song and <unk> <unk> a mysterious part - time investigator who looked like <unk> and carried a change of clothing in a <unk> envelope like an undercover <unk> on a good - will mission
they came by their strangeness honestly
<unk> grandmother no cookie baker excised the heads of disliked relatives from the family album and lugged around her perennial work - in-progress philosophy for women
the book loses some momentum toward the end when <unk> becomes more preoccupied with dating boys and less with her delightfully weird family
for the most part though there much pleasure in her saucy poignant probe into the mysteries of the babylonian <unk>
the <unk> also figures in <unk> <unk> <unk> latest novel which flashes back to the <unk> <unk> of the <unk>
but both the past and present worlds of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> pages <unk> feel cramped and static
for his sixth novel <unk> <unk> tried to resuscitate the protagonist of his n work about <unk> <unk>
<unk> is now a n writer whose continuing flirtation with drugs and marginal types in <unk> and <unk> <unk> seems quaintly out - of-synch
<unk> fondly remembers the old days of the early n when people like his friend <unk> would take a psychiatrist on a date to analyze what <unk> was doing wrong
an <unk> solution explains <unk> <unk>
line by line <unk> <unk> weary cynicism can be amusing especially when he riffing on the <unk> social scheme the way n people size each other up immediately canceling the desperate ones who merely almost made it
<unk> has avoided all that by living in a <unk> <unk> suburb with his wife who so addicted to soap operas and mystery novels n she barely seems to notice when her husband disappears for drug - seeking forays into <unk>
but it does n't take too many lines to figure <unk> out
he a bore
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> it agreed to pay n million as part of an accord with the <unk> <unk> <unk> regarding an environmental cleanup of a defunct smelter n the company formerly operated in <unk>
in <unk> the <unk> notified <unk> <unk> which was a part - owner of the smelter that it was potentially liable for sharing cleanup costs at the site under the federal <unk> program
the n area is contaminated with lead zinc and other metals
<unk> resources earlier this year proposed a reorganization plan that would make it a unit of a <unk> concern potentially exempting it from liability for the smelter cleanup costs
the company said that as part of its agreement with the <unk> it made certain voluntary undertakings with respect to intercorporate transactions entered into after the reorganization
the company which issued a statement on the agreement late <unk> said that n million of the payment was previously provided for in its financial statements and that <unk> will be recognized in its <unk> third - quarter statement
the agreement and consent decree are subject to court approval the company said n
<unk> resources added that it will seek to recover equitable contribution from others for both the amount of the settlement and any other liabilities n it may incur under the <unk> law
under the agreement <unk> must give the <unk> government n days advance written notice before issuing any dividends on common stock
the company net worth can not fall below n million after the dividends are issued
the terms of that agreement only become effective the date of <unk> reorganization which we anticipate <unk> will occur sometime in early <unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> general counsel
in addition <unk> must give the government n days advance written notice of any loans exceeding n million that are made to the <unk> - based holding company
<unk> net worth after those transaction must be at least n million
separately the company said <unk> it expects to hold a special meeting for shareholders in early n to vote on its proposed reorganization
many of the nation highest - ranking executives saluted <unk> market plunge as an overdue comeuppance for speculators and takeover players
assuming that the market does n't head into a bottomless free fall some executives think n <unk> action could prove a harbinger of good news as a sign that the leveraged buy - out and takeover frenzy of recent years may be abating
this is a reaction to artificial <unk> valuations rather than to any fundamentals said <unk> <unk> chairman of <unk> - <unk> <unk> whose shares dropped <unk> to n
if we get rid of a lot of that nonsense it will be a big plus
a few of the executives here for the fall meeting of the <unk> <unk> a group that meets to discuss national issues were only too happy to personalize their criticism
people wish <unk> the government would do something about leveraged buy - outs do something about takeovers do something about <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> chairman of <unk> <unk> whose stock dropped <unk>
where the leadership
where the guy who can say n <unk> is enough
the executives were remarkably unperturbed by the plunge even though it lopped billions of dollars off the value of their companies and millions off their personal fortunes
i not going to worry about one day decline said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> president who was leisurely strolling through the bright orange and yellow leaves of the mountains here after his company shares plunged n to close at <unk>
i did n't bother calling anybody i did n't even turn on tv
there has n't been any fundamental change in the economy added <unk> <unk> whose <unk> <unk> <unk> took an n slide to close at <unk>
the fact that this happened two years ago and there was a recovery gives people some comfort that this wo n't be a problem
of course established corporate managements often tend to applaud the setbacks of stock speculators and takeover artists
indeed one chief executive who was downright delighted by <unk> events was <unk> <unk> chairman of <unk> <unk> the parent of <unk> airlines and the target of a takeover offer by <unk> <unk>
asked whether <unk> action could help him avoid being trumped by the <unk> <unk> real estate magnate <unk> <unk> smiled broadly and said no comment
on <unk> morning before the market sell - off the business leaders issued a report predicting <unk> the economy would grow at roughly an inflation - adjusted n annual rate through next year then accelerate anew in <unk>
of the n economists who worked on the <unk> <unk> forecast only two projected periods of decline in the nation output over the next two years and in both instances the declines are too modest to warrant the phrase recession said <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman of <unk> <unk> <unk> and vice chairman of the <unk> <unk>
the real estate slump that pushing down the price of <unk> <unk> office space and housing is also affecting the city retail real estate market
in <unk> once - desirable store sites sit vacant and newly constructed space has been slow to fill
retail real estate brokers say n tenants are reluctant to sign leases because of uncertainty about the local economy turmoil in their own industries and a belief that rents have not yet hit bottom
there is an unbelievable amount of space available says <unk> <unk> senior vice president at <unk> - <unk> associates <unk> <unk> <unk>
there are about <unk> stores for rent up from a more typical range of <unk> to n
this further confuses retailers she says
they wonder should they sign a lease if prices are still coming down
is this the wrong time n to open a store
who is going to be in the space next door
in addition <unk> <unk> says n tenants usually can negotiate to pay rents that are about one - quarter lower than landlords initial asking price
a handful of hot retail locations such as the <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> areas have been able to sustain what many see as astronomical rents
and in some neighborhoods rents have merely hit a plateau
but on average <unk> retail rents have dropped <unk> to <unk> in the past six months alone experts say n
that follows a more subtle decline in the prior six months after <unk> rents had run up rapidly since n
the same factors limiting demand for office space have affected retailing
as businesses contract or depart the number of employees who might use retail services shrinks says <unk> <unk> <unk> senior vice president of <unk> <unk> <unk>
he says n financial problems plaguing electronics fur and furniture companies key categories in the local retail economy have further deflated the market
hardest hit are what he calls secondary sites that primarily serve neighborhood residents
in these locations <unk> <unk> says <unk> retailers are increasingly cautious about expanding and rents have remained steady or in some cases have declined
weakness in the restaurant industry which is leaving retail space vacant exacerbates the problem for landlords
it is also no comfort to landlords and small <unk> <unk> retailers when the future of larger department stores which anchor retail neighborhoods are in doubt
<unk> <unk> parent of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> is mired in bankruptcy proceedings and <unk> is for sale by its owner <unk> <unk>
the trend toward lower rents may seem surprising given that some communities in <unk> <unk> are bemoaning the loss of favorite local businesses to high rents
but despite the recent softening for many of these retailers there still been too big a jump from the rental rates of the late n when their leases were signed
certainly the recent drop in prices does n't mean <unk> <unk> comes cheap
<unk> <unk> retail rents still run well above the going rate in other <unk> cities
<unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> can command rents of up to <unk> a square foot and n is not uncommon
the thriving <unk> <unk> area offers rents of about <unk> a square foot as do up - and-coming locations along lower <unk> <unk>
by contrast rentals in the best retail locations in <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> rarely top n a square foot
and rents on <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> generally do n't exceed about <unk> a square foot
the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said n two securities will begin trading this week
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> will begin trading with the symbol <unk>
it makes investment castings and has traded over - the-counter
<unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> an <unk> <unk> financial services company will list american depositary shares representing preferred shares with the symbol <unk>
it will continue to trade on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the <unk> <unk> <unk> listed shares of two companies
<unk> telephones <unk> a <unk> <unk> telecommunications equipment supply company started trading with the symbol <unk>
it had traded over - the-counter

the pharmaceuticals maker had traded over - the-counter

when <unk> <unk> <unk> marks the start of his <unk> year on the <unk> <unk> today the occasion will differ sharply from previous anniversaries of his tenure
for the first time the <unk> justice finds his influence almost exclusively in dissent rather than as a force in the high court majority
this role reversal holds true as well for his three liberal and moderate allies <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
but are these four players three of them in their n ready to assume a different role after n years collectively of service on the high court
every indication is that the four are prepared to accept this new role and the frustrations that go with it but in different ways
justices <unk> and <unk> appear philosophical about it justices <unk> and <unk> appear fighting mad
the four justices are no newcomers to dissent often joining forces in the past decade to criticize the court conservative drift
but always in years past they have bucked the trend and have been able to pick up a fifth vote to eke out a number of major victories in civil rights and liberties cases
now however as the court new five - member conservative majority continues to solidify victories for the liberals are rare
the change is most dramatic for <unk> <unk> the last survivor of the <unk> liberal majority under <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
in the seven <unk> <unk> terms from the fall of n through the spring of <unk> the height of the <unk> <unk> power <unk> <unk> cast only n dissenting votes in <unk> cases decided by the court
last term alone he cast <unk> dissenting votes in <unk> decisions with the contentious flag - burning ruling as his only big victory
but <unk> <unk> foresaw his new role strongly defending the importance of dissents in a <unk> speech
each time n the court revisits an issue the justices will be forced by a dissent to reconsider the fundamental questions and to rethink the result he said
moreover in recent months he has said that when he was on the winning side in the <unk> he knew that the tables might turn in the future
he has said that he now knows how <unk> <unk> <unk> felt a reference to the late conservative justice who was the most frequent dissenter from the <unk> <unk> opinions
associates of <unk> <unk> <unk> say <unk> he was depressed about the court direction last spring but is feisty about his role and determined to speak out against the court cutbacks in civil rights
we could sweep it under the rug and hide it but i not going to do it he said in a speech last month
he like <unk> <unk> considers dissents highly important for the future a point that has n't escaped legal scholars
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> says n there is a generation - skipping flavor to current dissents
the dissenters in the <unk> <unk> he says n appeared to be writing for the short - term suggesting that the court direction might change soon
<unk> and <unk> are speaking in their dissents to a more distant future he says
<unk> <unk> who will turn n next month also seems feisty about his new role
associates say n he takes some defeats more personally than his colleagues especially attempts to curtail the right to abortion first recognized in his <unk> opinion <unk> vs. <unk>
friends and associates who saw <unk> <unk> during the summer said <unk> he was no more discouraged about the court than in recent years
and his outlook improved after successful cataract surgery in <unk>
but his level of frustration showed in a recent impassioned speech to a group of hundreds of lawyers in <unk>
he concluded his remarks by quoting emotionally and at some length according to those present the late <unk> <unk> <unk> famous i have a <unk> speech from the <unk> <unk> on <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> is probably the most philosophical of the dissenters about his role in part because he may be the least liberal of the four but also because he enjoys the intellectual challenge of arguing with the majority more than the others
if the role n these four dissenters are assuming is a familiar one in modern <unk> <unk> history it also differs in an important way from recent history court watchers say n
the dissenters of the <unk> <unk> were often defending a legal legacy that they inherited says <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> but the dissenters today are defending a legacy that they created
the government sold the deposits of four savings - and-loan institutions in its first wave of sales of big sick thrifts but low bids prevented the sale of a fifth
the four s&ls were sold to large banks as was the case with most of the <unk> previous transactions initiated by the <unk> <unk> <unk> since it was created in the s&l bailout legislation two months ago
two of the four big thrifts were sold to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which has aggressively expanded its markets particularly in <unk> and <unk>
a canadian bank bought another thrift in the first <unk> transaction with a foreign bank
under these deals the <unk> sells just the deposits and the healthy assets
these clean - bank transactions leave the bulk of bad assets mostly real estate with the government to be sold later
in these four for instance the <unk> is stuck with n billion in bad assets
acquirers paid premiums ranging from <unk> to <unk> for the deposits and branch systems roughly in line with what analysts were expecting
the buyers will also be locked into deposit rates for just two weeks as has been the case with previous deals
after that the buyers may repudiate the rates paid by the former thrifts
but it uncertain whether these institutions will take those steps
<unk> for example has been one of the highest rate payers in the <unk> market and in <unk> rates are especially sensitive in retirement communities
the <unk> had previously targeted five thrifts for quick sales in order to spend cash by certain budgetary deadlines but the delays illustrate the tough chore facing the agency
these thrifts are beached whales said <unk> <unk> an industry consultant based in <unk> <unk>
for example the delay in selling <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> billion in assets has forced the <unk> to consider selling off the thrift branch - by-branch instead of as a whole institution
<unk> continued its foray into the <unk> and <unk> markets
<unk> will acquire <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which had assets of n billion
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> will pay the <unk> a premium of n million for n billion in deposits
as a measure of the depths to which the <unk> real estate market has sunk the <unk> will pay <unk> billion to <unk> to take n million of bad assets
<unk> also acquired <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which had total assets of n million
<unk> will pay the <unk> a premium of n million for n billion in deposits
<unk> will also acquire n million of freedom assets from the <unk> which will require n million in assistance
<unk> <unk> <unk> reading <unk> will acquire <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which had n billion in assets
<unk> will pay a premium of n million to assume <unk> billion in deposits
it will also purchase n million of the thrift assets with n billion in <unk> assistance
in the first <unk> transaction with a foreign buyer <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> will acquire <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which had n million in assets
<unk> <unk> will pay the <unk> n million to assume n million in deposits
it will also purchase n million in assets and receive n million in assistance from the <unk>
the following issues were recently filed with the securities and <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> offering of <unk> common shares via <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>

<unk> magazine in a move n to reduce the costs of wooing new subscribers is lowering its circulation guarantee to advertisers for the second consecutive year increasing its subscription rates and cutting back on merchandise giveaways
in an announcement to its staff last week executives at <unk> <unk> <unk> weekly magazine said <unk> <unk> will dramatically de - emphasize its use of electronic giveaways such as telephones in television subscription drives cut the circulation n it guarantees advertisers by n to four million and increase the cost of its annual subscription rate by about <unk> to n
in a related development the news - weekly for the fourth year in a row said n it wo n't increase its advertising rates in <unk> a full four - color page in the magazine costs about n
however because the guaranteed circulation base is being lowered ad rates will be effectively <unk> higher per subscriber according to <unk> <unk> <unk> associate publisher
<unk> is following the course of some other mass - circulation magazines that in recent years have challenged the publishing myth that maintaining artificially high and expensive circulations is the way n to draw advertisers
in recent years <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and most recently <unk> <unk> tv <unk> have cut their massive circulation rate bases to eliminate marginal circulation and hold down rates for advertisers
deep discounts in subscriptions and offers of free clock radios and watches have become accepted forms of attracting new subscribers in the hyper - competitive world of magazine news - weeklies
but <unk> as part of the more cost - conscious <unk> <unk> wants to wean itself away from expensive gimmicks
besides time executives think n selling a news magazine with a clock radio is tacky
giveaways just give people the wrong image said <unk> <unk> <unk>
that perception takes the focus off the magazine
<unk> magazine executives predictably paint the circulation cut as a show of strength and actually a benefit to advertisers
what we are doing is screening out the readers who are only casually related to the magazine and do n't really read it said <unk> <unk>
we are trying to create quality and involvement
however <unk> executives used the same explanation when in <unk> <unk> the magazine cut its guaranteed circulation from n million to n million
and <unk> paid circulation according to <unk> <unk> of <unk> dropped <unk> to <unk> in the six months ended <unk> <unk> <unk>
still <unk> move is being received well once again
it terrific for advertisers to know n the reader will be paying more said <unk> <unk> <unk> national media director at <unk> <unk> ad agency
a few drops in circulation are of no consequence
it not a show of weakness they are improving the quality of circulation while insuring their profits
<unk> <unk> said n the changes represent a new focus in the magazine industry a magazine net revenue per subscriber or the actual revenue from subscribers after discounts and the cost of premiums have been stripped away
the question is how much are we getting from each reader said <unk> <unk>
<unk> rivals news - weeklies <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are less reliant on electronic giveaways and in recent years both have been increasing their circulation rate bases
both magazines are expected to announce their ad rates and circulation levels for n within a month
when the news broke of an attempted coup in <unk> two weeks ago <unk> <unk> <unk> called the <unk> <unk> for a briefing
they said follow <unk> he told reporters
that shows how far <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has come since its birth nine years ago when it was considered the laughingstock of television news
it is bigger faster and more profitable than the news divisions of any of the three major broadcast networks
its niche as the network of record during major crises draws elite audiences around the world
but for all its success <unk> has hit a plateau
although viewership soars when big news breaks it ebbs during periods of calm
<unk> executives worry that the network punchy but repetitive news format may be getting stale and wo n't keep viewers coming back as the alternatives multiply for news and information on cable - tv
just the fact n we on <unk> hours is no longer bulletin says <unk> <unk> <unk> executive vice president news gathering and no relation to <unk> <unk>
you ca n't live on that
so <unk> a unit of <unk> - based <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is trying to reposition itself as a primary channel or what people in the television industry call a top of mind network
tonight to kick off the effort <unk> will premiere its first prime - time newscast in years an hourlong show at <unk> p.m eastern time <unk> to air head - to-head against the network newscasts
the show will be co - anchored by <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> a <unk> former <unk> judge and campus beauty queen who has never held a job in television or journalism
the new show is perhaps the boldest in a number of steps n the network is taking to build audience loyalty by shifting away from its current format toward more full - length signature programming with recognizable stars
to distinguish itself <unk> is also expanding international coverage and adding a second global - news program
it is paying higher salaries after years of scrimping to lure and keep experienced staffers
and it is embarking on an expensive gamble to break major stories with a large investigative - reporting team
the next stage is to get beyond the opinion leaders who use us as a point of reference to become a point of reference at ordinary dinner tables says <unk> <unk> executive vice president of <unk> <unk> <unk> sister network
but that wo n't be easy
networks like other consumer products develop images in peoples minds that are n't easy n to change
it also takes money that <unk> has been reluctant to spend to make programs and hire talent that viewers will tune in specially to see
and the cable - tv operators <unk> distributors and part owners like things just the way n they are
the repositioning bid is aimed at <unk> unsteady viewership and what may happen to it as the cable - tv news market grows more competitive
already <unk> is facing stronger competition from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> both of which are likely to pursue more general news in the future
in addition many cable - tv systems themselves are airing more local and regional news programs produced by local broadcast stations
<unk> wants to change its viewers habits
its watchers are on the whole a disloyal group of channel - zapping grazers and news junkies who spend an average of just n minutes a day watching <unk> according to audience research
that less than one - third the time that viewers watch the major broadcast networks
the brief attention n viewers give <unk> could put it at a disadvantage as ratings data and advertising become more important to cable - tv channels
<unk> viewer habits have been molded by its format
its strategy in the past has been to serve as a tv wire service
it focused on building up its news bureaus around the world so as events took place it could go live quicker and longer than other networks
it filled its daily schedule with newscasts called <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but the shows varied little in content personality or look
now the push is on for more - distinctive shows
our goal is to create more programs with an individual identity says <unk> <unk> <unk> executive vice president for programming
accordingly <unk> is adding a world - affairs show in the morning because surveys show n its global - news hour in the afternoon is among its most differentiated programs in viewers minds says <unk> <unk> <unk>

then there the <unk> <unk> the prime - time newscast featuring <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
until now <unk> has featured its <unk> gossip show during the key evening period
but <unk> of the cable - television-equipped households that watch news do so between n p.m. and n p.m. the network discovered n so <unk> wants in
<unk> <unk> says <unk> the <unk> - <unk> team will probably do two live interviews a day with most of the program at least for now appearing similar to <unk> other newcasts
some in the industry are skeptical
i find it hard to conceive of people switching over to <unk> for what at least in the public mind is the same news says <unk> <unk> the former two - time president of <unk> <unk> and creator of the <unk> - <unk> <unk>

in <unk> the network hired award - winning producer <unk> <unk> the former head of news specials at <unk>

that such a departure from the past that many in the industry are skeptical <unk> <unk> will follow through with its investigative commitment especially after it sees the cost of producing in - depth pieces

but to improve they really got to make the investment in people
in any case cable - tv-system operators have reason n to fear any tinkering with <unk> format
they market cable - tv on the very grazing opportunities n <unk> seeks to discourage
we would obviously be upset if those kinds of services evolved into more general - interest long - format programming says <unk> <unk> senior vice president programming of <unk> <unk> <unk> which holds a <unk> stake in <unk> <unk>
the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of appeals opinion in the <unk> <unk> case did not repudiate the position <unk> <unk> <unk> took in its dispute with <unk> contrary to your <unk> n article court <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> too late
the fundamental rule of contract law applied to both cases was that courts will not enforce agreements to which the parties did not intend to be bound
in the <unk> litigation the courts found <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> intended to be bound in <unk> phosphates they found n there was no intention to be bound
admittedly the principle in the cases is the same
but the outcome of a legal dispute almost always turns on the facts
and the facts as found by the various courts in these two lawsuits were different

lawyers for dozens of insolvent savings and loan associations are trying a new tack in their efforts to defuse suits filed by borrowers developers and creditors

though the argument may have a common - sense ring to it even the s&l lawyers concede n there little precedent n to back their position
still one federal appeals court has signaled n it willing to entertain the notion and the lawyers have renewed their arguments in <unk> and eight other states where the defense is permitted under state law
the dismissal of the pending suits could go a long way toward clearing court dockets in <unk> and reducing the <unk> massive legal bills which topped n million last year

<unk> steep rise in producer prices shows that inflation still persists and the pessimism over interest rates caused by the new price data contributed to the stock market plunge <unk>
after falling for three consecutive months the producer price index for finished goods shot up n last month the <unk> <unk> reported <unk> <unk> as energy prices jumped after tumbling through the summer
although the report which was released before the stock market opened did n't trigger the <unk> drop in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> analysts said <unk> it did play a role in the market decline
analysts immediately viewed the price data the grimmest inflation news in months as evidence that the <unk> <unk> was unlikely to allow interest rates to fall as many investors had hoped n
further fueling the belief that pressures in the economy were sufficient to keep the <unk> from easing credit the <unk> <unk> reported <unk> that retail sales grew <unk> in <unk> to n billion
that rise came on top of a <unk> gain in <unk> and suggested n there is still healthy consumer demand in the economy
i think n the <unk> report combined with the actions of the <unk> weakened the belief that there was going to be an imminent easing of monetary policy said <unk> <unk> chief economist at <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>
but economists were divided over the extent of the inflation threat signaled by the new numbers
the overall <unk> increase is serious in itself but what is even worse is that excluding food and energy the producer price index still increased by <unk> said <unk> <unk> an economist at the <unk> <unk> of manufacturers
but <unk> <unk> <unk> chief economist at <unk> <unk> in <unk> blamed rising energy prices and the annual autumn increase in car prices for most of the <unk> jump
i would say n this is not bad news this is a blip he said
the core rate is not really out of line
all year energy prices have skewed the producer price index which measures changes in the prices n producers receive for goods
inflation unquestionably has fallen back from its torrid pace last winter when a steep run - up in world oil prices sent the index surging at double - digit annual rates
energy prices then plummeted through the summer causing the index to decline for three consecutive months
overall the index has climbed at a n compound annual rate since the start of the year the <unk> <unk> said <unk>
while far more restrained than the pace at the beginning of the year that is still a steeper rise than the <unk> increase for all of <unk>
moreover this year good inflation news may have ended last month when energy prices zoomed up <unk> after plunging n in <unk>
some analysts expect oil prices to remain relatively stable in the months ahead leaving the future pace of inflation uncertain
analysts had expected that the climb in oil prices last month would lead to a substantial rise in the producer price index but the <unk> climb was higher than most anticipated n
i think n the resurgence in inflation is going to continue for a few months said <unk> <unk> chief economist at <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> economic forecasting firm
he predicted <unk> that inflation will moderate next year saying that credit conditions are fairly tight world - wide
but <unk> <unk> <unk> president of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> - <unk> said that last month rise is n't as bad an omen as the n figure suggests <unk>
if you examine the data carefully the increase is concentrated in energy and motor vehicle prices rather than being a broad - based advance in the prices of consumer and industrial goods he explained
passenger car prices jumped n in <unk> after climbing <unk> in <unk> and declining in the late spring and summer
many analysts said <unk> the <unk> increase was a one - time event coming as dealers introduced their n models
although all the price data were adjusted for normal seasonal fluctuations car prices rose beyond the customary autumn increase
prices for capital equipment rose a hefty n in <unk> while prices for home electronic equipment fell n
food prices declined n after climbing <unk> in <unk>
meanwhile the retail sales report showed that car sales rose n in <unk> to n billion
but at least part of the increase could have come from higher prices analysts said n
sales at general merchandise stores rose n after declining n in <unk> while sales of building materials fell <unk> after rising n
producer prices for intermediate goods grew n in <unk> after dropping for three consecutive months
prices for crude goods an array of raw materials jumped <unk> after declining n in <unk> and edging up n in <unk>
here are the <unk> <unk> producer price indexes <unk> <unk> for <unk> before seasonal adjustment and the percentage changes from <unk> n
<unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> it expects to report a loss of at least n million to n million for the third quarter
in the year - earlier period <unk> had net income of <unk> but no per - share earnings
<unk> president and chief executive officer <unk> <unk> said <unk> the loss stems from several factors
he said <unk> nonperforming assets rose to slightly more than n million from n million between <unk> and <unk>
approximately n of the total consisted of nonperforming commercial real estate assets
accordingly <unk> estimated that it will provide between n million and n million for credit losses in the third quarter
<unk> added that significant additional loan - loss provisions may be required by federal regulators as part of the current annual examination of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> primary subsidiary based in <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> operates <unk> banking offices in <unk> <unk> and <unk>
<unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> will also mark its portfolio of high - yield corporate bonds to market as a result of federal legislation requiring that savings institutions divest themselves of such bonds
that action <unk> said n will result in a charge against third - quarter results of approximately n million
<unk> also said n it expects to shed its remaining mortgage loan origination operations outside its principal markets in <unk> <unk> and <unk> and as a result is taking a charge for discontinued operations
all these actions <unk> <unk> said n will result in a loss of n million to n million for the third quarter
he added however <unk> depending on the resolution of certain accounting issues relating to mortgages servicing and the outcome of the annual examination of <unk> <unk> currently in progress with respect to the appropriate level of loan loss reserves the total loss for the quarter could significantly exceed this range
<unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> federal thrift regulators ordered it to suspend dividend payments on its two classes of preferred stock indicating that regulators concerns about the troubled institution have heightened
in a statement <unk> - based <unk> said n the regulators cited the thrift operating losses and apparent losses in its junk - bond portfolio in ordering the suspension of the dividends
regulators also ordered <unk> to stop buying back the preferred stock
<unk> <unk> <unk> chairman and chief executive officer criticized the federal <unk> of <unk> <unk> which issued the directive saying n it was inappropriate and based on insufficient reasons
he said n the thrift will try to get regulators to reverse the decision
the suspension of a preferred stock dividend is a serious step that signals that regulators have deep concerns about an institution health
in <unk> regulators labeled <unk> a troubled institution largely because of its big junk - bond holdings and its operating losses
in the same month the <unk> of <unk> <unk> ordered the institution to stop paying common stock dividends until its operations were on track
for the nine months ended <unk> <unk> <unk> had a net loss of n million compared with year - earlier net income of n million
<unk> which is <unk> largest thrift holds one of the largest junk - bond portfolios of any thrift in the nation
since <unk> it has pared its high - yield bond holdings to about n million from n billion
<unk> <unk> said <unk> only about n million of the current holdings are tradeable securities registered with the securities and <unk> <unk>
the remainder he said n are commercial loan participations or private placements that are n't filed with the <unk> and do n't have a ready market
<unk> and regulators have been in a dispute over market valuations for the junk bonds
the <unk> of <unk> <unk> has been hounding <unk> to provide current market values for its holdings but <unk> has said n it ca n't easily obtain such values because of the relative illiquidity of the bonds and lack of a ready market
regulators have become increasingly antsy about <unk> and other thrifts junk - bond holdings in light of the recent federal thrift bailout legislation and the recent deep decline in the junk - bond market
the legislation requires thrifts to divest themselves of junk bonds in the new somber regulatory climate
in <unk> <unk> <unk> composite trading <unk> <unk> common shares closed at <unk> down n cents
in a statement <unk> <unk> <unk> challenged the regulators decision saying n the thrift operating losses and apparent junk - bond losses have been substantially offset by gains in other activities of the bank
he also said n substantial reserves have been set aside for possible losses from the junk bonds
in the third quarter for instance <unk> added n million to its general reserves
<unk> <unk> said <unk> the regulators should instead move ahead with approving <unk> request to sell n of its <unk> branches to <unk> <unk> <unk> a unit of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> based in <unk> <unk> <unk>
the branch sale is the centerpiece of <unk> strategy to transform itself into a traditional s&l from a high - flying institution that relied heavily on securities trading for profits according to <unk> <unk>
most analysts and thrift executives had expected a decision on the proposed transaction which was announced in <unk> long before now
many interpret the delay as an indication that regulators are skeptical about the proposal
branches and deposits can be sold at a premium in the event n federal regulators take over an institution
<unk> however touts the branch sale saying n it would bring in n million and reduce the thrift assets to n billion from n billion
it said <unk> the sale would give it positive tangible capital of n million or about <unk> of assets from a negative n million as of <unk> <unk> thus bringing <unk> close to regulatory standards
<unk> said <unk> the branch sale would also reduce the company large amount of good will by about n million
critics however say <unk> the branch sale will make <unk> more dependent than ever on brokered deposits and junk bonds
<unk> <unk> counters that he intends to further pare the size of <unk> by not renewing more than <unk> billion of brokered certificates of deposit when they come due
the thrift is also working to unload its junk - bond portfolio by continuing to sell off the bonds and it plans to eventually place some of them in a separate affiliate as required under the new thrift law

but perhaps even more remarkable the three - hour-show <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> regularly wins the top slot in the country tv ratings sometimes drawing as many as <unk> of west german households
as the n economic integration approaches <unk> cultural curators have taken to the ramparts against american cultural imperialism threatening to impose quotas against such pop invaders as <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
but much of what the europeans want to protect seems every bit as cheesy as what they are trying to keep out
the most militant opposition to american tv imports has come from french television and movie producers who have demanded quotas ensuring that a full n of <unk> <unk> shows be produced in <unk>
so far the <unk> have failed to win enough broad - based support to prevail
a glance through the television listings and a few twists of the european television dial suggest one reason why
while there are some popular action and drama series few boast the high culture and classy production values n one might expect
more european air time is filled with low - budget game shows variety hours movies and talk shows many of which are authorized knock - offs of their american counterparts
one of <unk> most popular <unk> night programs features semi - celebrities seeking out their grammar - school classmates for on - air reunions
a flemish game show has as its host a belgian pretending to be italian
one of <unk> favorite shows <unk> a tepid variety show is so popular that viewers clamored to buy a chocolate product <unk> <unk> whose praises were sung each week by dancing showgirls even though the product did n't exist
topping the cheese stunt on another typical evening of fun on <unk> <unk> a contestant won a bet with the show host <unk> <unk> that he could identify n german dialects over the telephone
a celebrity guest <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> also won a bet that someone could pile up <unk> worth of quarters on a slanted coin
<unk> <unk> nonetheless paid the penalty as if he had lost agreeing to spend a day with west german <unk> <unk> <unk> - <unk> <unk> frying and selling their combined weight in potato pancakes
if this seems like pretty weak stuff around which to raise the protectionist barriers it may be because these shows need all the protection n they can get
european programs usually target only their own local audience and often only a small portion of that
<unk> - hits in <unk> or <unk> rarely make it even to <unk> or <unk> <unk> and almost never show up on <unk> screens
attempts to produce pan - european programs have generally resulted in disappointment
one annual co - production the three - hour-long <unk> <unk> <unk> featuring soft - rock songs from each of n european countries has been described as the world most boring tv show
another <unk> <unk> <unk> where villagers from assorted european countries make fools of themselves performing pointless tasks is a hit in <unk>
a u.s.-made imitation under the title almost anything goes flopped fast
for the most part what made here stays here and for good reason
the cream of the british crop the literary dramas that are shown on <unk> public television as <unk> <unk> make up a relatively small part of british air time
most british programming is more of an acquired taste
there is for instance one man and his <unk> a herding contest among sheep dogs
also riveting to the british are hours of dart - throwing championships even more hours of lawn bowling contests and still more hours of snooker marathons
european drama has had better though still mixed fortunes
the most popular such shows focus on narrow national concerns
a french knock - off of <unk> called <unk> and set in a french vineyard had a good run in <unk> which ended after the female lead was injured in a real - life auto accident
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a kind of german <unk> elsewhere set in a health spa is popular in <unk> and has spread into <unk>
<unk> most popular series is a drama called <unk> <unk> or the <unk> which chronicles the fight of an idealistic young investigator in <unk> against the <unk>
it was front - page news in <unk> earlier this year when the fictional inspector was gunned down in the series
<unk> most popular mini - series this year was <unk> the story of an aging bullfighter
the trend is pretty well established now that local programs are the most popular with american programs second says <unk> <unk> a former director of programs for the <unk> <unk> <unk>
given a choice everybody will watch a home - produced show
but frequently there is n't much choice
thus <unk> has begun the recent crusade n to produce more worthy shows of its own programs with broader appeal
we basically got to start from scratch to train writers and producers to make shows that other people will want to see concedes <unk> <unk> head of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
while some in the <unk> contend that advertising is the bane of television here many believe that its absence is to blame for the european tv industry sluggish development
until recently national governments in <unk> controlled most of the air time and allowed little or no advertising
since production costs were guaranteed it did n't matter that a program could n't be sold abroad or put into syndication as most american programs are
but not much money was spent on the shows either a situation that encouraged cheap - to-make talk and game shows while discouraging expensive - to-produce dramas
now however commercial channels are coming to most european countries and at the same time satellite and cable technology is spreading rapidly
just last week <unk> authorized two commercial channels for the first time <unk> earlier began to allow commercial television alongside its state channels
the result is a new and huge appetite for programming
but perhaps to the consternation of those calling for quotas most of this void is likely to be filled with the cheapest and most plentiful programming now available reruns usually of shows made in the <unk>

yesterday a source close to <unk> confirmed that his company may join the <unk> fight as part of a possible consortium that would bid against <unk> <unk> and <unk> - <unk>

also any <unk> bid might be blocked by british antitrust regulators <unk> is <unk> main competitor on several key defense - electronics contracts and its purchase by <unk> may heighten <unk> <unk> <unk> worries about concentration in the country defense industry
a consortium bid however would diminish <unk> direct role in <unk> and might consequently appease ministry officials

the capability of existing fields to deliver oil is dropping and oil exploration activity is also down dramatically as many producers shift their emphasis to natural gas said <unk> <unk> <unk> vice president for government and industry relations with interprovincial parent <unk> <unk> <unk>

there has been a swing of the pendulum back to the gas side he said
many of <unk> oil and gas producers say n the outlook for natural gas is better than it is for oil and have shifted their exploration and development budgets accordingly
the number of active drilling rigs in <unk> is down <unk> from a year ago and the number of completed oil wells is down more than that due to the increasing focus on gas exploration said <unk> <unk> manager of crude oil with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> an industry group
<unk> <unk> said <unk> the main reason for the production decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature conventional fields in western <unk>

but when something is inevitable you learn to live with it he said
<unk> <unk> stressed that the delay of <unk> proposed expansion wo n't by itself increase <unk> dependence on offshore crude however since canadian imports are limited in any case by <unk> falling output
under terms of its proposed two - step expansion which would have required regulatory approval <unk> intended to add n barrels a day of additional capacity to its system beginning with a modest expansion by <unk>
the system currently has a capacity of n million barrels a day
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> expects to report that third - quarter earnings dropped more than <unk> from the previous quarter as a result of reduced sales volume and increased costs
in the second quarter the steelmaker had net income of n million or <unk> a share including a pretax charge of n million related to the settlement of a suit on sales of n billion
the company said <unk> normal seasonal softness and lost orders caused by prolonged labor talks reduced shipments by <unk> tons in the latest quarter compared with the second quarter
at the same time the integrated - steel business was hurt by continued increases in materials costs and repair and maintenance expenses as well as higher labor costs under its new contract
the service - center business was hurt by reduced margins and start - up costs associated with its <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> unit
the company said <unk> it is beginning to see some shipping - rate improvements in both the intergrated - steel and steel - service-center segments which should result in improved results for the fourth quarter
<unk> said <unk> its third - quarter results will be announced later this week
in the year - earlier third quarter when the industry was in the midst of a boom the company had net of n million or <unk> a share on sales of n billion
predicting the financial results of computer firms has been a tough job lately
take <unk> <unk> the largest maker of personal computer software and generally considered an industry bellwether
in <unk> the company stunned <unk> <unk> with the prediction that growth in the personal computer business overall would be only <unk> in <unk> a modest increase when compared with the sizzling expansion of years past
investors taking this as a sign that a broad industry slump was in the offing reacted by selling the company stock which lost n that day to close at n in national over - the-counter trading
but that was all of three months ago
last week <unk> said <unk> it expects revenue for its first quarter ended <unk> n to increase n
the announcement caused the company stock to surge <unk> to close at <unk> a share
<unk> surprising strength is one example of the difficulty facing investors looking for reassurances about the financial health of the computer firms
it hard to know what to expect at this point said <unk> <unk> an analyst at <unk> <unk> <unk>
the industry defies characterization
to illustrate <unk> <unk> said that of the <unk> computer - related firms n he follows half will report for their most recent quarter earnings below last year results and half above those results
among those companies expected to have a down quarter are <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> microsystems <unk> generally solid performers in the past
<unk> <unk> machines <unk> also is expected to report disappointing results
<unk> <unk> <unk> meanwhile is expected to show improved earnings for the period ended <unk>
another contradictory message comes from <unk> <unk> a computer retailer
in <unk> the company reported that booming sales of new personal computers from <unk> and <unk> had resulted in net income more than doubling for its fourth quarter ended <unk> <unk> to n million or n cents a share
this month however <unk> warned investors that results for its first quarter ended <unk> <unk> had n't met expectations
the company said <unk> it expects earnings of <unk> to n cents a share down from <unk> cents a share in the year - earlier period
while the earnings picture confuses observers say n the major forces expected to shape the industry in the coming year are clearer
companies will continue to war over standards
in computer publishing a battle over typefaces is hurting <unk> <unk> <unk> which sells software that controls the image produced by printers and displays
until recently <unk> had a lock on the market for image software but last month <unk> <unk> biggest customer and <unk> rebelled
now the two firms are collaborating on an alternative to <unk> approach and analysts say n they are likely to carry <unk> the biggest seller of personal computers along with them
the short - term outlook for <unk> business however appears strong
the company is beginning to ship a new software program that being heralded as a boon for owners of low - end printers sold by <unk>
the program is aimed at improving the quality of printed material
<unk> <unk> <unk> chief executive officer said <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> company has been receiving n calls a day about the product since it was demonstrated at a computer publishing conference several weeks ago
meanwhile competition between various operating systems which control the basic functions of a computer spells trouble for software firms generally
it creates uncertainty and usually slows down sales said <unk> <unk> an analyst at <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> said <unk> this probably is behind the expected weak performance of <unk> <unk> maker of a widely used computer publishing program
he expects <unk> to report earnings of n cents a share on revenues of n million for its third quarter compared with earnings of n cents a share on revenue of n million in the year - earlier period
<unk> officials could n't be reached for comment
on the other hand the battle of the bus is expected to grow increasingly irrelevant
a bus is the data highway within a computer
<unk> is backing one type of bus called microchannel while the nine other leading computer makers including h - p and <unk> <unk> <unk> have chosen another method
users do n't care about the bus said <unk> <unk> an analyst at <unk> <unk> <unk>
he said <unk> <unk> family of <unk> computers for instance uses four different buses and no one seems to mind
the gap between winners and laggards will grow
in personal computers <unk> <unk> and <unk> are expected to tighten their hold on their business
at the same time second - tier firms will continue to lose ground
some lagging competitors even may leave the personal computer business altogether
<unk> <unk> for instance is considered a candidate n to sell its troubled operation
<unk> has done well establishing a distribution business but they have n't delivered products that sell said <unk> <unk> an analyst at <unk> - <unk> securities
<unk> <unk> estimates n <unk> whose terminals business is strong will report a loss of n cents a share for its quarter ended <unk>
personal - computer makers will continue to eat away at the business of more traditional computer firms
ever - more powerful desk - top computers designed with one or more microprocessors as their brains are expected to increasingly take on functions carried out by more expensive minicomputers and mainframes
the guys that make traditional hardware are really being obsoleted by microprocessor - based machines said <unk> <unk>
as a result of this trend longtime powerhouses <unk> - <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> are scrambling to counterattack with microprocessor - based systems of their own
but they will have to act quickly
<unk> <unk> expects <unk> to unveil a family of high - end personal computers later this year that are powerful enough to serve as the hub for communications within large networks of desk - top machines
a raft of new computer companies also has targeted this server market
population <unk> ends for midwestern
<unk> is making a comeback
so are <unk> <unk> and <unk>
the population of all four states is on the upswing according to new <unk> <unk> estimates following declines throughout the early n
the gains to be sure are rather small
<unk> for instance saw its population grow by <unk> people or <unk> between <unk> and <unk> the <unk> <unk> says <unk>
still even that modest increase is good news for a state that had n't grown at all since n
between <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> was the only state in the <unk> <unk> to lose population a loss of n people
six of the n midwestern states have been growing steadily since <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
the <unk> has been holding its own in the population race
seven of nine states have grown each year since <unk> including <unk> <unk> which lost n of its population during the n
and although <unk> and <unk> suffered slight declines earlier in the decade they are growing again
at the same time several states in the <unk> and <unk> have had their own population turnaround
seven states that grew in the early n are now losing population <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
overall though the <unk> and <unk> still outpace the <unk> and <unk> and fast - growing states like <unk> and <unk> ensure that the pattern will continue
but the growth gap between the <unk> <unk> and other regions has clearly started narrowing
more elderly <unk> their
thanks to modern medicine more couples are growing old together
and even after losing a spouse more of the elderly are staying independent
a new <unk> <unk> study of the noninstitutionalized population shows that n of people aged <unk> to n were living with a spouse in <unk> up from <unk> in <unk>
this does n't mean <unk> they less likely to live alone however
that share has remained at about <unk> since <unk>
what has changed is that more of the young elderly are living with spouses rather than with other relatives such as children
in <unk> <unk> of those aged n to <unk> lived with relatives other than spouses down from <unk> in <unk>
as people get even older many become widowed
but even among those aged n and older the share living with a spouse rose slightly to <unk> in <unk> from <unk> in <unk>
like their younger counterparts the older elderly are less likely to live with other relatives
only n of those aged n and older lived with relatives other than spouses in <unk> down from <unk> in <unk>
the likelihood of living alone beyond the age of <unk> has increased to <unk> from <unk>
more people are remaining independent longer presumably because they are better off physically and financially
careers <unk> most for the
many affluent people place personal success and money above family
at least that what a survey by <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> indicates
two - thirds of respondents said n they strongly felt the need to be successful in their jobs while fewer than half said n they strongly felt the need to spend more time with their families
being successful in careers and spending the money n they make are top priorities for this group
unlike most studies of the affluent market this survey excluded the super - rich
average household income for the sample was <unk> and average net assets were reported as <unk>
the goal was to learn about one of today fastest - growing income groups the upper - middle class
although they represent only n of the population they control nearly one - third of discretionary income
across the board these consumers value quality buy what they like rather than just what they need and appreciate products that are distinctive
despite their considerable incomes and assets <unk> of the respondents in the study do n't feel financially secure and one - fourth do n't feel that they have made it
twenty percent do n't even feel <unk> they are financially well off
many of the affluent are n't comfortable with themselves either
about n do n't feel n they more able than others
while twothirds feel some guilt about being affluent only <unk> give n or more to charity each year
thirty - five percent attend religious services regularly at the same time <unk> feel that in life one sometimes has to compromise one principles
odds and
the <unk> of women and minorities who hold jobs in top management in the nation largest banks has more than doubled since <unk>
the <unk> bankers <unk> says that women make up <unk> of officials and managers in the top n banks up from <unk> in <unk>
the share of minorities in those positions has risen to <unk> from <unk>
per - capita personal income in the <unk> grew faster than inflation last year according to the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
the amount of income divvied up for each man woman and child was <unk> in <unk> up n from <unk> in <unk>
per capita personal income ranged from <unk> in <unk> to <unk> in <unk>
there are n million students in college this fall up n from <unk> the <unk> <unk> for <unk> statistics estimates n
about n are women and <unk> are part - time students
this small <unk> suburb got trouble
trouble with a capital <unk> and that rhymes with p and that stands for pool
more than n years ago <unk> . <unk> <unk> the con man in <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> warned the citizens of <unk> <unk> <unk> against the game
now kindred spirits on <unk> town council have barred the town fanciest hotel the <unk> <unk> from installing three free pool tables in its new lounge
<unk> <unk> <unk> and two members of the council said n they were worried about setting a precedent that would permit pool halls along <unk> main street
and the mayor in an admonition that bears a rhythmic resemblance to <unk> . <unk> warned that alcohol leads to betting which leads to fights
the council action is yet another blow to a sport that its fans claim <unk> has been maligned unjustly for years
obviously they not in touch with what going on says <unk> <unk> vice president of the <unk> <unk> billiards <unk>
pool is hot in <unk> <unk> and <unk> he insists <unk> where upscale suit - and-tie places are adding tables
with today tougher drunk driving laws he adds n people do n't want to just sit around and drink
besides rowdy behavior seems unlikely at the <unk> <unk> where rooms average n a night and the cheap mixed drinks go for <unk> a pop
at the lounge manager <unk> <unk> wo n't admit patrons in jeans <unk> - shirts or tennis shoes
but a majority of the <unk> council did n't buy those arguments
introducing pool argued <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> would be dangerous
it would open a can of worms
<unk> is no stranger to cans of worms either
after its previous mayor committed suicide last year an investigation disclosed that town officials regularly voted on their own projects gave special favors to developer friends and dipped into the town coffers for trips and retreats
the revelations embarrassed town officials although they argued that the problems were n't as severe as the media suggested n
now comes the pool flap
i think n there some people worried about something pretty ridiculous <unk> <unk> <unk> says
i thought n this was all taken care of in the <unk> <unk>
the only thing <unk> <unk> <unk> could praise about <unk> new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was the local color unfortunately neither he nor the producers of the show have done their homework
for instance <unk> white is not the ultimate insult <unk> haole is
<unk> <unk> dresses as a <unk> haole tucking in a hawaiian shirt and rolling up its long sleeves
and the local expression for brother is brah not bruddah
and even if a nurse would wear flowers in her hair while on duty if she were engaged she would know to wear them behind her left not right ear
sorry the show does not even have the one redeeming quality of genuine local color
<unk>
of all the ethnic tensions in <unk> which is the most troublesome right now
a good bet would be the tension between blacks and jews in <unk> <unk> <unk>
or so it must seem to <unk> <unk> the veteran jewish comedian appearing in a new <unk> sitcom airing on <unk> nights n p.m. <unk>
not only is <unk> <unk> the star of <unk> <unk> he also the inheritor of a comedic tradition dating back to <unk> <unk> and he currently a man in hot water
here in neutral language is the gist of <unk> <unk> remarks quoted first in the <unk> <unk> while he was a paid spokesman for the <unk> <unk> mayoral campaign and then in <unk> after he and the campaign parted company
<unk> <unk> said that many jewish voters feel guilty toward blacks so they support black candidates uncritically
he said that many black voters feel bitter about racial discrimination so they too support black candidates uncritically
he said that jews have contributed more to black causes over the years than vice versa
of course <unk> <unk> did not use neutral language
as a practitioner of ethnic humor from the old days on the <unk> <unk> live television and the nightclub circuit <unk> <unk> instinctively reached for the vernacular
he said n jews were sick with complexes and he called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> black opponent a fancy shvartze with a mustache
if <unk> <unk> had used less derogatory language to articulate his amateur analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow <unk> yorkers would the water be quite so hot
it probably would because few or none of the people upset by <unk> <unk> remarks have bothered to distinguish between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used insulting language
in addition some of <unk> <unk> critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism
for example the <unk> <unk> state counsel for the <unk> said that <unk> <unk> is like a dinosaur
people are fast leaving the place where he is stuck
these critics fail to distinguish between the type of ethnic humor that aims at disparaging another group such as polish jokes and the type that is double - edged aiming inward as well as outward
the latter typically is the humor of the underdog and it was perfected by both blacks and jews on the minstrel and vaudeville stage as a means of mocking their white and gentile audiences along with themselves
in the hands of a zealot like <unk> <unk> this double - edged blade could cut both the self and the audience to ribbons
but wielded by a pro like <unk> <unk> it is a constructive form of mischief
why constructive
because despite all the media prattle about comedy and politics not mixing they are similar in one respect both can serve as mechanisms for easing tensions and facilitating the co - existence of groups in conflict
that why it dangerous to have well - intentioned thought police on college campuses and elsewhere taboo all critical mention of group differences
as <unk> <unk> wrote in the <unk> <unk> <unk> just before the <unk> donnybrook perhaps intolerance would not boil over with such intensity if honest differences were allowed to simmer
the question is if group conflicts still exist as undeniably they do and if <unk> <unk> type of ethnic humor is passe then what other means do we have for letting off steam
do n't say <unk> the tv sitcom because that happens to be a genre that in its desperate need to attract everybody and offend nobody resembles politics more than it does comedy
it is true that the best sitcoms do allow group differences to simmer yuppies vs. blue - collar bostonians in cheers children vs. adults in the <unk> <unk>
but these are not the differences that make headlines
in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> plays <unk> a jewish bachelor courting <unk> <unk> <unk> an irish widow and mother of three against the wishes of his mother <unk> <unk> and her brother <unk> <unk> <unk>
it worth noting that both disapproving relatives are immigrants
at least they both speak with strong accents as do <unk> and <unk>
it could n't be more obvious that <unk> <unk> is being made from an old recipe
and a safe one imagine if the romance in question were between an <unk> <unk> and a member of the <unk> of <unk>
back in the n the play and movie versions of <unk> <unk> <unk> made the theme of courtship between the assimilated offspring of jewish and irish immigrants so popular that its author <unk> <unk> lost a plagiarism suit on the grounds that the plot has entered the public domain
and it has remained there as evidenced by its reappearance in a <unk> <unk> sitcom called <unk> loves <unk> whose sole distinction was that it led to the real - life marriage of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
clearly the question with <unk> <unk> is not whether the pot will boil over but whether it will simmer at all
so far the bubbles have been few and far between
part of the problem is the tendency of all sitcoms ever since the didactic days of <unk> <unk> to preach about social issues
to some extent this tendency emerges whenever the show tries to enlighten us about ethnic stereotypes by reversing them
for instance <unk> dislikes <unk> not because he a shrewd jewish businessman but because he quits his well - paying job as a salesman in order to become a social worker
even more problematic is the incompatibility between sitcom preachiness and <unk> <unk> comic persona
the best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end and occasionally in the middle when <unk> <unk> slips into his standup mode and starts meting out that old - fashioned jewish mischief to other people as well as to himself
but too often these routines lack spark because this sitcom like all sitcoms is timid about confronting <unk> <unk> stock in trade ethnic differences
i not suggesting that the producers start putting together episodes about topics like the <unk> - jewish dispute over the carmelite convent at <unk>
that issue like racial tensions in <unk> <unk> <unk> will have to cool down not heat up before it can simmer
but i am suggesting that they stop requiring <unk> <unk> to interrupt his classic shtik with some line about caring for other people that would sound shmaltzy on the lips of <unk> <unk>
at your age <unk> you ought to know that you ca n't make soup without turning up the flame
the official <unk> <unk> reaction to a plunge in stock prices has a n history of calm right up through <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said in a statement <unk> that the stock - market decline does n't signal any fundamental change in the condition of the economy
the economy he added <unk> remains well - balanced and the outlook is for continued moderate growth
sound familiar
here what <unk> <unk> said after the <unk> crash the underlying economy remains sound
there is nothing wrong with the economy all the indices are up
heard that before
after the <unk> crash <unk> <unk> said n the fundamental business of the country is on a sound and prosperous basis
<unk> <unk> <unk> years old was elected president and chief executive officer of this maker of magnetic recording heads for disk drives
he has been president and chief executive officer of <unk> <unk> <unk> a division of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> itself a subsidiary of <unk> <unk> of the <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who had been acting chief executive since <unk> <unk> will continue as chairman
the former president and chief executive <unk> <unk> <unk> resigned in <unk>
the <unk> decision to approve a bare - bones deficit - reduction bill without a capital - gains tax cut still leaves open the possibility of enacting a gains tax reduction this year
late <unk> night the <unk> voted n to approve an estimated n billion measure that had been stripped of hundreds of provisions that would have widened rather than narrowed the federal budget deficit
lawmakers drastically streamlined the bill to blunt criticism that it was bloated with special - interest tax breaks and spending increases
we putting a deficit - reduction bill back in the category of being a deficit - reduction bill said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
but <unk> supporters of the trimmer legislation said that other bills would soon be moving through <unk> that could carry some of the measures that had been cast aside including a capital - gains tax cut
in addition the companion deficit - reduction bill already passed by the <unk> includes a capital - gains provision
<unk> - <unk> negotiations are likely to begin at midweek and last for a while
no one can predict exactly what will happen on the <unk> side said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
but he added <unk> i believe n republicans and democrats will work together to get capital - gains reform this year
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> told reporters yesterday that the administration would n't push to keep the capital - gains cut in the final version of the bill
we do n't need this as a way n to get capital gains he said
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said in an interview n if that the signal that comes from the <unk> <unk> that will help a great deal
the <unk> decision was a setback for <unk> <unk> and will make approval of a capital - gains tax cut less certain this year
opponents of the cut are playing hardball
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> he was confident that any <unk> - <unk> agreement on the deficit - reduction legislation would n't include a capital - gains tax cut
and a senior aide to the <unk> ways and means <unk> where tax legislation originates said n there are n't any plans to produce another tax bill that could carry a gains tax cut this year
one obvious place <unk> to attach a capital - gains tax cut and perhaps other popular items stripped from the deficit - reduction bill is the legislation n to raise the federal borrowing limit
such legislation must be enacted by the end of the month
the <unk> bill was pared back in an attempt to speed deficit - reduction through <unk>
because the legislation has n't been completed <unk> <unk> has until midnight tonight to enact across - the-board spending cuts mandated by the <unk> - <unk> deficit - reduction law
senators hope that the need to avoid those cuts will pressure the <unk> to agree to the streamlined bill
the <unk> appears reluctant to join the senators
a key is whether <unk> republicans are willing to acquiesce to their <unk> colleagues decision to drop many pet provisions
although i am encouraged by the <unk> action said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> ways and means <unk> it is uncertain whether a clean bill can be achieved in the upcoming conference with the <unk>
another big question hovering over the debate is what <unk> <unk> thinks
he has been resisting a stripped - down bill without a guaranteed vote on his capital - gains tax cut
but republican senators saw no way n to overcome a procedural hurdle and garner the <unk> votes needed to win the capital - gains issue on the floor so they went ahead with the streamlined bill
the <unk> bill was stripped of many popular though revenue - losing provisions a number of which are included in the <unk> - passed bill
these include a child - care initiative and extensions of soon - to-expire tax breaks for low - income housing and research - and-development expenditures
also missing from the <unk> bill is the <unk> repeal of a law called <unk> <unk> that compels companies to give rank - and-file workers comparable health benefits to top paid executives
one high - profile provision that was originally in the <unk> bill but was cut out because it lost money was the proposal by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts
<unk> <unk> said <unk> he hopes <unk> the <unk> will consider that measure soon
to the delight of some doctors the bill dropped a plan passed by the <unk> <unk> that would have overhauled the entire physician - reimbursement system under <unk>
to the detriment of many low - income people efforts to boost <unk> funding especially in rural areas also were stricken
asked why senators were giving up so much <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the ranking <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> said n we looking like idiots
things had just gone too far
<unk> <unk> said that the move required sacrifice by every senator
it worked others said n because there were no exceptions all revenue - losing provisions were stricken
the <unk> also dropped a plan by its <unk> <unk> that would have increased the income threshold beyond which senior citizens have their <unk> <unk> benefits reduced
in addition the bill dropped a plan to make permanent a n excise tax on long - distance telephone calls
it no longer includes a plan that would have repealed what remains of the completed - contract method of accounting which is used by military contractors to reduce their tax burden
it also drops a provision that would have permitted corporations to use excess pension funds to pay health benefits for current retirees
also stricken was a fivefold increase in the maximum <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> penalties which would have raised n million in fiscal <unk>
a provision that would have made the <unk> <unk> <unk> an independent agency was excised
the approval of the <unk> bill was especially sweet for <unk> <unk> who had proposed the streamlining
<unk> <unk> relations with <unk> <unk> <unk> who pushed for a capital - gains cut to be added to the measure have been strained since <unk> <unk> chose to bypass the <unk> <unk> and deal with other lawmakers earlier this year during a dispute over drug funding in the fiscal <unk> supplemental spending bill
the deficit reduction bill contains n billion in tax increases in fiscal <unk> and <unk> billion over five years
the revenue - raising provisions which affect mostly corporations would
prevent companies that have made leveraged buy - outs from getting federal tax refunds resulting from losses caused by interest payments on debt issued to finance the buy - outs effective <unk> <unk> <unk>
require mutual funds to include in their taxable income dividends paid to them on the date that the dividends are declared rather than received effective the day after the tax bill is enacted
close a loophole regarding employee stock ownership plans effective <unk> <unk> <unk> that has been exploited by investment bankers in corporate takeovers
the measure repeals a <unk> exclusion given to banks on the interest from loans used to acquire securities for an <unk> if the <unk> owns less than n of the employer stock
curb junk bonds by ending tax benefits for certain securities such as zero - coupon bonds that postpone cash interest payments
raise n million by suspending for one year an automatic reduction in airport and airway taxes
speed up the collection of the payroll tax from large companies effective <unk> <unk>
impose a tax on ozone - depleting chemicals such as those used in air conditioners and in <unk> beginning at <unk> a pound starting next year
withhold income taxes from the paychecks of certain farm workers currently exempt from withholding
change the collection of gasoline excise taxes to weekly from semimonthly effective next year
restrict the ability of real estate owners to escape taxes by swapping one piece of property for another instead of selling it for cash
increase to n a person from <unk> the international air - passenger departure tax and impose a n tax on international departures by commercial ships
the measure also includes spending cuts and increases in federal fees
among its provisions
reduction of <unk> spending in fiscal n by some n billion in part by curbing increases in reimbursements to physicians
the plan would impose a brief freeze on physician fees next year
removal of the <unk> <unk> <unk> operating budget from the federal budget reducing the deficit by n billion
a similar provision is in the <unk> version
<unk> for the <unk> <unk> <unk> to raise n million by charging fees for commercial airline - landing rights at <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> airports <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> in <unk>
increases in <unk> <unk> <unk> fees totaling n million

<unk> <unk> <unk> contributed to this article
in response to your overly optimistic outdated piece on how long unemployment lasts people <unk> <unk> n i am in the communications field above entry level
i was laid off in <unk> <unk> and after a thorough and exhausting job search was hired in <unk> <unk>
my unemployment insurance ran out before i found a job i found cutbacks and layoffs in many companies
the statistics quoted by the new <unk> <unk> report garnered from <unk> to n are out of date certainly as an average for the <unk> and possibly for the rest of the country
i think n what bothered me most about the piece was that there seemed to be an underlying attitude to tell your readers n all is well if you getting laid off do n't worry and if you unemployed it a seller market
to top it off you captioned the graph showing the average number of months in a job search as time off
are you kidding
looking for a job was one of the most anxious periods of my life and is for most people
your paper needs a serious reality check

<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk> majority - owned unit of <unk> . des <unk> <unk>
in <unk> edition the name of the unit was misstated
<unk> investors <unk> said n it reduced its rating on n million of subordinated debt of this <unk> hills <unk> thrift citing turmoil in the market for low - grade high - yield securities
the agency said <unk> it reduced its rating on the thrift subordinated debt to <unk> from <unk> and will keep the debt under review for possible further downgrade
<unk> savings is a major holder of so - called junk bonds
new federal legislation requires that all thrifts divest themselves of such speculative securities over a period of years
<unk> savings officials were n't available for comment on the downgrade
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> investors <unk> <unk> said n it downgraded its rating to <unk> from <unk> on less than n million of this thrift senior subordinated notes
the rating concern said <unk> <unk> troubled diversification record in the securities business was one reason for the downgrade citing the troubles at its <unk> <unk> subsidiary and the possible sale of other subsidiaries
they perhaps had concern that we were getting out of all these said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
i think n it was a little premature on their part
just when it seemed safe to go back into stocks <unk> <unk> suffered another severe attack of nerves
does this signal <unk> another <unk> <unk> is coming
or is this an extraordinary buying opportunity just like <unk> n <unk> eventually turned out to be
here what several leading market experts and money managers say about <unk> action what happens next and what investors should do
<unk> <unk>
i the only one who said n there would be an <unk> massacre all through late <unk> and <unk> says <unk> <unk> once a widely followed market guru and still a well - known newsletter writer
everyone will tell you that this time is different from <unk> he says
well in some ways it is different but technically it is just the same
if you a technician you obey the signals
right now they telling me to get the hell out and stay out
i see no major support until <unk>
i see a possibility of going to <unk> this month
<unk> <unk> says <unk> he would n't even think of buying until at least <unk> to n stocks have hit n lows about n stocks hit new lows <unk>
most people he says have no idea what a massacre pattern looks like
<unk> <unk>
a quantitative analyst with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> had warned clients to take their money out of the market before the <unk> crash
<unk> big drop she says n was not a crash
this was an <unk> massacre like those that occurred in <unk> and <unk>
now as in those two years her stock market indicators are positive
so she thinks n the damage will be short - lived and contained
those corrections lasted one to four weeks and took the market n down she says
this is exactly the same thing as far as i concerned
thus she says n if the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> dropped below <unk> it would just be a fluke
my advice is to buy
as she calculates it the average stock now sells for about n times companies earnings
she says n that ratio could climb to <unk> given current interest rates and still be within the range of fair value
<unk> <unk>
<unk> fall marks the start of a bear market says <unk> <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
but <unk> <unk> whose views are widely respected by money managers says n he expects no <unk> crash
there was a unique combination in n he says
margin debt was at a record high
there was tremendous public enthusiasm for stock mutual funds
the main thing was portfolio insurance a mechanical trading system intended to protect an investor against losses
a hundred billion dollars in stock was subject to it
in <unk> such selling contributed to a snowball effect
today could even be an up day <unk> <unk> says <unk> if major brokerage firms agree to refrain from program trading
over the next several months though he says n things look bad
i think n the market will be heading down into <unk> he says
we will probably have a year - end rally and then go down again
sort of a two - step bear market
he expects the downturn to carry the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> down to around <unk> sometime next year
that would be a normal bear market he says
i guess <unk> that my forecast
<unk> <unk> <unk>
i do n't think n the market is going through another <unk> n
i do n't think n that the case at all says <unk> <unk> a partner at <unk> <unk> <unk> and chairman of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> sees this as a good time n to pick up bargains but he does n't think n there any need to rush
i expect the market to open weaker <unk> but then it should find some stability
he ticks off several major differences between now and two years ago
unlike <unk> interest rates have been falling this year
unlike <unk> the dollar has been strong
and unlike <unk> the economy does n't appear to be in any danger of overheating
but the economy slower growth this year also means n the outlook for corporate profits is n't good he says n
so it a very mixed bag
thus he concludes n this is not a good environment n to be fully invested in stocks
if i had come into <unk> on margin or with very little cash in the portfolios i would not do any buying
but we came into <unk> with a conservative portfolio so i would look to do some modest buying on behalf of clients
we going to look for some of the better - known companies that got clocked <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
this is the latest manifestation of the capacity of the financial community for recurrent insanity says <unk> <unk> an economist
i see this as a reaction to the whole junk bond explosion he says
the explosion of junk bonds and takeovers has lodged a lot of insecure securities in the hands of investors and loaded the corporations that are the objects of takeovers or feared takeovers with huge amounts of debt rather than equity
this has both made investors uneasy and the corporations more vulnerable
nevertheless he says n a depression does n't appear likely
there is more resiliency in the economy at large than we commonly suppose n he says
it takes more error now to have a major depression than back in the <unk> much as the financial community and the government may try
<unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> money manager <unk> <unk> an expert at spotting takeover candidates says that takeovers are n't totally gone
companies are still going to buy companies around the world he says
examples are <unk> looking at <unk> <unk> looking at <unk> <unk>
these sorts of takeovers do n't require junk bonds or big bank loans to finance them so <unk> <unk> figures n they will continue
the market was up n since <unk> <unk> took office <unk> <unk> says <unk> so a correction was to be expected
he thinks <unk> another crash is unlikely and says <unk> he was nibbling at selected stocks during <unk> plunge
stocks that were thrown out just on an emotional basis are a great opportunity this week for guys like me he says
<unk> <unk>
it seems to me that this is the pin that has finally pricked the balloon says <unk> <unk> a professor of finance at <unk> <unk> and former co - manager of one of the most successful hedge funds in history <unk> <unk>
he sees economic problems financial problems ahead for the <unk> with a fairly strong possibility of a recession
<unk> you could n't sell dollars he says
dealers would give you a quote but then refuse to make the trade
if the dollar stays weak he says n that will add to inflationary pressures in the <unk> and make it hard for the <unk> <unk> <unk> to ease interest rates very much
<unk> <unk> wo n't decide what to do today until he sees how the <unk> and <unk> markets go
he recommends that investors sell takeover - related stocks but hang on to some other stocks especially utilities which often do well during periods of economic weakness
<unk> <unk>
many people now claim to have predicted the <unk> crash
<unk> newsletter writer <unk> <unk> <unk> actually did it he stated in writing in <unk> n that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was likely to decline about <unk> points the following month
<unk> <unk> says n what happens now will depend a good deal on the <unk> <unk> <unk>
if it promptly cuts the discount rate <unk> it charges on loans to banks he says n that could quiet things down
if not we could go to <unk> very soon
<unk> <unk> <unk>
stock prices would still have to go down some additional amount before we become positive on stocks says <unk> <unk> <unk> president and managing director of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>
<unk> which manages about n billion drew stiff criticism from many clients earlier this year because it pulled entirely out of stocks at the beginning of the year and thus missed a strong rally
<unk> is keeping its money entirely in cash equivalents primarily <unk> <unk> bills
<unk> - bills probably are the right place <unk> to be he says
regarding the <unk> n letter to the editor from <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman of the <unk> <unk> on <unk> and <unk> alleging
n that your <unk> n editorial <unk> committees was factually inaccurate and deliberately misleading
i thought <unk> your editorial was factually accurate and deliberately elucidative
n that <unk> <unk> supported the rights of the witnesses to take the <unk> <unk>
yes he did
as i watched him on <unk> - <unk> i heard n him speak those lovely words about the <unk> of rights which he quotes from the transcript of the hearings
he did repeat those nice platitudes several times as an indication of his support for the <unk>
he used about <unk> words defending the witnesses constitutional rights
unfortunately by my rough guess he used better than n words heaping scorn on the witnesses for exercising the <unk>
he sandwiched his praise of constitutional meat between large loaves of bilious commentary
as your editorial rightly pointed out <unk> <unk> former <unk> secretary and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> former aide are currently being held up to scorn for taking the <unk> <unk>
that certainly is not the supposed distorted reading indicated by <unk> <unk>
n that his committee does not deal with any possible criminal activity at <unk>
my colleagues and i fully realize <unk> we are not a court etc
absolute rubbish
by any reasonable man criterion <unk> <unk> and his colleagues have a whole bunch of people tried and convicted
apparently their verdict is in
right now they pursuing evidence
that not a bad way n to proceed just somewhat different from standard american practice
how was that practice referred to when i was in school
ah yes something called a <unk> <unk>
of course <unk> <unk> doth protest that his subcommittee simply seeks information for legislative change
no doubt n that partially true
everything that <unk> <unk> says in his letter is partially true
he right about his subcommittee responsibilities when it comes to obtaining information from prior <unk> officials
but if his explanation of motivation is true why is his investigation so oriented as to identify criminal activity
why not simply questions designed to identify sources and causes of waste and inefficiency
such as what happened when <unk> wanted to know about <unk> toilet seats or whatever they supposedly cost
no <unk> <unk> complaints simply wo n't wash
n that the <unk> defends the sleaze fraud waste embezzlement influence - peddling and abuse of the public that took place while <unk> <unk> was secretary of <unk> etc . and so forth
no to my mind the <unk> did not defend sleaze fraud waste embezzlement influence - peddling and abuse of the public trust
it defended appropriate constitutional safeguards and practical common sense
the problem which the <unk> so rightly pointed out in a number of articles is not the likes of <unk> <unk> who after all is really a bit player on the stage but the attempt by <unk> to enhance itself into a quasi - parliamentary\/judicial body
of course we also got a judiciary that seeks the same objective
the system is the problem not an individual member
individuals can always have their hands slapped
it when such slapping does n't occur that we got trouble
i do not by any means defend <unk> management
but i think n the kind of congressional investigation that has been pursued is a far greater danger to american notions of liberty and freedom than any incompetency and yes maybe criminality within <unk> could possibly generate
the last time n i saw a similar congressional hearing was when <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> did his work
<unk>
<unk> <unk>
i disagree with the statement by <unk> <unk> that one should not draw an adverse inference against former <unk> officials who assert their <unk> <unk> privilege against self - incrimination in congressional hearings
the <unk> <unk> states in relevant part that no person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself
this privilege against self - incrimination precludes the drawing of an adverse inference against a criminal defendant who chooses not to testify
thus in a criminal case a prosecutor can not comment on a defendant failure to testify nor can the defendant be compelled to take the stand as a witness thus forcing him to take the <unk>
the privilege however has been limited in accordance with its plain language to protect the defendant in criminal matters only
the <unk> <unk> and some states have specifically recognized that the <unk> <unk> does not preclude the inference where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause
<unk> v. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
thus in a civil case a defendant may be called as a witness he may be forced to testify or take the <unk> and his taking of the <unk> may permit the drawing of an adverse inference against him in the civil matter
he may take the <unk> in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and justifiable belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution
allowing the defendant to take the <unk> in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one testimony harms him in the civil matter but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution
absent the risk of such prosecution a court may order the defendant to testify
thus when <unk> <unk> asserted the <unk> in a noncriminal proceeding particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel one must conclude that he held a good - faith justifiable belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution
the subcommittee <unk> and the american public have every right to draw the adverse inference and to concur with <unk> <unk> own belief that his testimony could help convict him of a crime
drawing the adverse inference in a noncriminal congressional hearing does not offend the <unk> <unk> shield against self - incrimination
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
it was <unk> the n and the stock market plummeted nearly n points
just a coincidence
or is triskaidekaphobia fear of the number n justified
in academia a so - called <unk> the <unk> effect has been set up and shot down by different professors
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> professors of finance at the <unk> of <unk> found evidence that the market is spooked by <unk> the n
but their study which spanned the n period has since been shown to be jinxed by an unlucky choice of data
in the <unk> the market took falls nine times in a row on <unk> the you - know-what
but the date tends to be a plus not a minus for stocks according to <unk> <unk> a collector of stock market lore
another study found that the <unk> <unk> the n in the n period had higher than average returns higher even than fridays in general which tend to be strong days for stock prices
on the only other <unk> the n this year the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> rose about four points
<unk> <unk> says n the original study titled <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> was published tongue - in-cheek
in a similar vein he adds that the anniversary of the <unk> crash and <unk> full moon could have played a part too in <unk> market activity
reminiscent of those during the <unk> crash that as stock prices plummeted and trading activity escalated some phone calls to market makers in over - the-counter stocks went unanswered
we could n't get dealers to answer their phones said <unk> <unk> senior vice president of <unk> trading at <unk> - <unk> <unk> in <unk>
it was like the <unk> before <unk> <unk> two years ago
whether unanswered phone calls had any effect or not nasdaq stocks sank far less than those on the <unk> <unk> and american exchanges
nonetheless the <unk> <unk> <unk> suffered its biggest point decline of the year and its sixth worst ever diving <unk> or <unk> to n
ten points of the drop occurred during the last n minutes of trading
by comparison the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> tumbled <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> fell <unk>
on <unk> n <unk> the <unk> <unk> fell <unk> points or <unk> followed by its devastating <unk> or n slide three days later
<unk> volume <unk> totaled n million shares which was only the fifth busiest day so far this year
the single - day record of n million shares was set on <unk> n
there was n't a lot of volume because it was just impossible to get stock moved said <unk> <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> company that makes markets in thousands of <unk> issues
most of the complaints about unanswered phone calls came from regional brokers rather than individual investors
<unk> <unk> of <unk> - <unk> and others were quick to add that they believe n the problem stemmed more from traders inability to handle the volume of calls rather than a deliberate attempt to avoid making trades
the subject is a sore one for <unk> and its market - making companies which were widely criticized two years ago following complaints from investors who could n't reach their brokers or trade in the chaos of the crash
<unk> <unk> head of retail equity trading at <unk> <unk> <unk> declared <unk> it was the last hour of trading on a <unk>
there were too many phones ringing and too many things happening to expect market makers to be as efficient as robots
it was n't intentional we were all busy
<unk> <unk> head of <unk> trading at <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> said <unk> it was just like two years ago
everybody was trying to do the same thing at the same time
<unk> <unk> the <unk> trading chief at <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> said proudly that his company executed every order n it received by the close of trading
but he added n you can only take one call at a time
market makers keep supplies of stock on hand to maintain orderly trading when imbalances occur
on days like <unk> that means n they must buy shares from sellers when no one else is willing to
when selling is so frenzied prices fall steeply and fast
two years ago faced with the possibility of heavy losses on the stocks in their inventories market makers themselves began dumping shares exacerbating the slide in <unk> stock prices
on <unk> some market makers were selling again traders said n
but with profits sagging on <unk> <unk> since the crash companies have kept smaller share stockpiles on hand
<unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> said n some prices fell without trades taking place as market makers kept dropping the prices at which they would buy shares
everyone was hitting everyone else bid he said
so while <unk> companies incurred losses on <unk> trading officials said n the damage was n't as bad as it was in <unk>
two years ago we were carrying huge inventories and that was the big culprit
i do n't know of anyone carrying big inventories now said <unk> <unk> of <unk> - <unk>
<unk> <unk> head of equity trading at <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> said that <unk> <unk> actually made money on <unk>
it helped that his inventory is a third smaller now than it was two years ago he said n
<unk> <unk> president of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> which oversees the <unk> computerized trading system said that despite the rush of selling he never considered the situation an emergency
the pace of trading was orderly he said
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> worked beautifully as did the automated system for larger trades according to <unk> <unk>
nevertheless the shock of another steep plunge in stock prices undoubtedly will shake many investors confidence
in the past the <unk> market thrived on a firm base of small - investor participation
because <unk> trading volume has n't returned to pre - crash levels traders and <unk> market officials hope <unk> the damage wo n't be permanent
but they are worried
we were just starting to get the public confidence back lamented <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
more troubling is the prospect that the overall collapse in stock prices could permanently erode the base of small - investor support n the <unk> market was struggling to rebuild in the wake of the <unk> <unk> crash
<unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> says n some action from government policy makers would allay investor fears
it wo n't take much more to scare the hell out of retail investors he says n
the sellers on <unk> came from all corners of the <unk> market big and small institutional investors as well as individual investors and market makers
but grateful traders said n the sell orders generally ranged from <unk> shares to n shares compared with blocks of <unk> shares or more two years ago
<unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> retail investors nervously sold stock <unk> and never returned to bargain - hunt
institutional investors which had been selling stock throughout last week to lock in handsome gains made through the third quarter were calmer
we had a good amount of selling from institutions but not as much panic <unk> <unk> said
if they could n't sell some of them put the shares back on the shelf
in addition he said n some bigger institutional investors placed bids to buy some <unk> stocks whose prices were beaten down
in addition <unk> <unk> said <unk> computer - guided program selling of <unk> stocks in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> small stocks and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> sent occasional waves through the market
<unk> biggest stocks were hammered
the <unk> <unk> <unk> of the largest nonfinancial issues including the big <unk> technology issues tumbled <unk> or <unk> to n
the <unk> <unk> <unk> of giant insurance and banking stocks dropped <unk> or <unk> to n
the <unk> market has only a handful of takeover - related stocks
but they fell sharply
<unk> <unk> <unk> for instance has offered to buy <unk> <unk> as well as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> cellular telephone interests and in a separate transaction sell certain <unk> properties to <unk> <unk>
<unk> lost <unk> or <unk> <unk> to n
<unk> <unk> dropped <unk> <unk> or <unk> to <unk> <unk>
the turnover in both issues was roughly normal
on a day when negative takeover - related news did n't sit well with investors <unk> <unk> a maker of engineered metal parts said <unk> <unk> partners advised it that it does n't plan to pursue its previously reported <unk> bid to buy the company
<unk> <unk> plummeted <unk> to n
the issues of companies with ties to the junk bond market also tumbled <unk>
on the <unk> market <unk> <unk> a big buyer of the high - risk high - yield issues slid <unk> to <unk> <unk>

pension funds insurers and other behemoths of the investing world said n they began scooping up stocks during <unk> market rout
and they plan to buy more today
rightly or wrongly many giant institutional investors appear to be fighting the latest war by applying the lesson n they learned in the <unk> n crash buying at the bottom pays off
to be sure big investors might put away their checkbooks in a hurry if stocks open sharply lower today
they could still panic and bail out of the market
but their n performance indicates that they wo n't abandon stocks unless conditions get far worse
last time we got rewarded for going out and buying stocks when the panic was the worst said <unk> <unk> <unk> president of <unk> - based <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which manages n billion of stocks
<unk> <unk> spent half his cash on hand <unk> for our favorite stocks that have fallen apart
he expects to invest the rest if the market weakens further
<unk> - based portfolio manager <unk> <unk> was n't daunted when <unk> rout shaved n million from the value of the n million <unk> <unk> <unk> he oversees

i spent n million in the last half - hour
other money managers also opened their wallets
i was buying at the close <unk> and i be buying again because i know n we getting good value said <unk> <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
there is no justification on the fundamental level for this crash
unlike mutual funds which can be forced to sell stockholdings when investors rush to withdraw money big investors such as pension funds and insurance companies can decide to ride out market storms without jettisoning stock
most often they do just that because stocks have proved to be the best - performing long - term investment attracting about <unk> trillion from pension funds alone
if you bought after the crash you did very very well off the bottom said <unk> <unk> <unk> chief investment officer of <unk> - based <unk> <unk> services <unk>
the <unk> billion <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for one added n billion to its stock portfolio two years ago
the last crash taught institutional investors that they have to be long - term holders and that they ca n't react to short - term events good or bad said <unk> <unk> <unk> senior vice president for the pension consultants <unk> associates in <unk> <unk> <unk>
those that pulled out of stocks regretted it he said so i doubt n you see any significant changes in institutional portfolios as a result of <unk> decline
stocks as measured by the <unk> <unk> <unk> index have been stellar performers this year rising n before <unk> plunge excluding dividends
even <unk> slump leaves investors ahead more than n well above the annual average for stocks over several decades
you could go down n points and still have a good year in the market said <unk> <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> - based <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> however worries that the market could go down <unk> or <unk> points in the next few days
it can happen before you can turn around
he said <unk> he discerns many parallels with n including the emphasis on takeover stocks and the <unk> - emergence of computerized program trading
the only thing n you do n't have he said is the portfolio insurance phenomenon overlaid on the rest
most institutional investors have abandoned the portfolio insurance hedging technique which is widely thought to have worsened the <unk> crash
not really insurance this tactic was designed to soften the blow of declining stock prices and generate an offsetting profit by selling waves of <unk> futures contracts
in its severest test the <unk> billion of portfolio insurance in effect in the <unk> crash did n't work as stock buyers disappeared and stock and futures prices became disconnected
even without portfolio insurance market conditions were grim <unk> money managers said n
<unk> <unk> whose <unk> <unk> - based <unk> <unk> partners had converted <unk> of its n million investment pool to cash in recent months said <unk> he was besieged by <unk> <unk> firms <unk> asking him to take stock off their hands
we got calls from big block houses asking us if we want to make bids on anything said <unk> <unk> who happy with his returns on investments chalked up earlier declined the offers
<unk> <unk> predicts n stocks will appear to stabilize in the next few days before declining again trapping more investors
i think n it will be a rigor mortis rally he said
meanwhile <unk> brought a reprieve for money managers whose investment styles had put them at odds with the market rally
especially gleeful were the short sellers who have been pounded by this year market climb
the shorts sell borrowed shares hoping to profit by replacing them later at a lower price
the nation largest short - selling operation is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which said last <unk> that its short positions had shown losses of <unk> for the year up to that point
all that now has changed
we ahead for the year because of <unk> said the firm <unk> <unk>
we not making a killing but we had a good day
<unk> and <unk> <unk> spokesman <unk> <unk> said <unk> the agency has turned over evidence in a criminal investigation concerning <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> office in <unk>
neither <unk> nor any of the <unk> gardens <unk> company officials or employees have been charged with any crimes
<unk> won approval to market a version of a blood pressure medicine but acknowledged that it substituted a <unk> <unk> <unk> product as its own in tests
<unk> <unk> also said n the <unk> has asked <unk> <unk> <unk> to recall at the retail level its urinary tract antibiotic
but so far the company has n't complied with that request the spokesman said n
<unk> the subject of a criminal investigation by the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> office of the <unk> and <unk> services <unk> only agreed to recall two strengths of its version of <unk> as far down as direct customers mostly wholesalers <unk> <unk> said <unk>
<unk> of <unk> <unk> earlier began a voluntary recall of both its <unk> <unk> and <unk> milligram versions of the drug
the <unk> has said n it presented evidence <unk> it uncovered to the company indicating that <unk> substituted the brand - name product for its own to gain government approval to sell generic versions of <unk>
<unk> has denied that it switched the brand - name product for its own in such testing
the west german retailer <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> plans to challenge the legality of a widely employed anti - takeover defense of companies in the <unk>
the eventual court decision could become a landmark in dutch corporate law because the lawsuit <unk> <unk> plans to file would be the first n to challenge the entire principle and practice of companies issuing voting preferred shares to management - controlled trusts to dilute voting power of common stockholders
up to now only specific aspects of these defenses have been challenged though unsuccessfully <unk> <unk> lawyers noted n
should the courts uphold the validity of this type of defense <unk> will then ask the court to overturn such a vote - diluting maneuver recently deployed by <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> says n the dutch - based international food retailer had n't reasonable grounds n to issue preferred stock to a friendly trust and thus dilute the worth and voting power of <unk> and other shareholders
speaking through its dutch lawyers <unk> also disclosed n it holds a <unk> stake in <unk>
it was previously thought <unk> <unk> held a <unk> stake that was accumulated since <unk>
a spokesman for <unk> said <unk> his company is confident of its own position and the propriety of the preferred - share issue
he termed <unk> legal actions as unproductive to international cooperation among european retailers
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is a conservative banker and a loyal <unk> but on <unk> morning he had few kind words for <unk> <unk> economic policy - making
there are some very significant issues out there such as the fiscal deficit the trade deficit our relations with <unk> that have to be the subject of major initiatives he said in an interview
i like to see that initiative and i have n't
there is n't a big shot an agenda
a few hours later the stock market dropped <unk> points
politicians tried to finger each other for the blame although many analysts doubt that <unk> was singly responsible for <unk> <unk> woes
but <unk> <unk> comments make one thing clear some on <unk> <unk> wonder if anyone is in charge of economic policy
consider this
by n p.m. tonight <unk> <unk> must order <unk> billion of automatic across - the-board cuts in government spending to comply with the <unk> - <unk> budget law
the cuts are necessary because <unk> and the administration have failed to reach agreement on a deficit - cutting bill
we simply do n't have strong leadership <unk> to try to reduce the deficit and make tough choices <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said yesterday on <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk>
for the last two weeks the <unk> administration and the <unk> <unk> have been engaged in a semi - public battle over international economic policy
the administration has been trying to push the dollar lower the <unk> has been resisting
one of the things that continues to worry me is this monetary warfare between the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> economist on <unk> this week
the administration has sent out confusing signals about its response to a recent spate of airline takeovers
last month <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> forced <unk> airlines to reduce a stake held by <unk> <unk> <unk> airlines
but he has since run into opposition from the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> over that decision
and he has kept mum on how his decision might affect a bid for <unk> <unk> which includes a big stake by <unk> <unk> <unk>
some analysts say <unk> uncertainty about <unk> anti - takeover policy was one reason that financing for the <unk> <unk> takeover fell through the event that triggered the market drop
in many ways the backdrop to <unk> stock decline is eerily similar to that of <unk> <unk> <unk> crash
then as now the budget debate was behind schedule and automatic spending cuts were within days of taking hold
the <unk> was locked in a battle over international economic policy although at that time it was with west german officials rather than the <unk> <unk>
and concern about official actions aimed at takeovers then by the tax - writing <unk> ways and means <unk> rather than the <unk> <unk> were making markets nervous
the <unk> crash brought the <unk> administration and democratic lawmakers to the table for the first budget summit resulting in a two - year plan to reduce the deficit by more than n billion even though the deficit actually rose by nearly n billion during that period
but barring further drops in the market this week a similar outcome does n't seem likely this year
lawmakers and administration officials agree that <unk> drop by itself is n't enough to force both sides back to the table to try to reach a deficit - reduction agreement that would be more serious and more far - reaching than last spring gimmick - ridden plan which still is n't fully implemented
one of the biggest reasons that new talks are n't likely to come about is that as everyone learned in <unk> the economy and the market can survive a one - day n tumble
everybody thought n we were looking at a repetition of n that we were looking at a recession <unk> <unk> said yesterday in an interview
that did not happen
they learned <unk> they could survive it without much problem
but administration officials privately agree with <unk> <unk> who said <unk> a precipitous drop this week is going to force the president and <unk> to take a much harder look at fiscal policy
in that case there will be plenty of blame <unk> to go around
there is an underlying concern on the part of the american people and there should be that the administration has not gone far enough in cutting this deficit and that <unk> has been unwilling to cut what the administration asked us to cut said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
nevertheless it clearly will take more than <unk> <unk> decline to overcome the bitter feelings that have developed between lawmakers and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> over the capital - gains fight
<unk> democrats are particularly angry over <unk> <unk> claim that the capital - gains cut was part of <unk> budget accord and his insistence on combining it with the deficit - reduction legislation
there is no prospect of any so - called grand compromise or deal next year because the administration simply did n't live up to this year deal <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said yesterday on <unk> <unk> face the <unk>
during last week maneuverings on the deficit - cutting bill and the capital - gains issue there were signs that <unk> republicans and the administration were at odds
at the very moment that <unk> republicans were negotiating a deal n to exclude capital gains from the deficit - reduction legislation <unk> <unk> spokesman <unk> <unk> told reporters that it was the president policy to include it
when an agreement was reached to strip capital gains from the legislation <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the ranking <unk> member of the tax - writing <unk> <unk> <unk> hailed it

<unk> market tumble could spur action on reconciling the <unk> and <unk> versions of the deficit - reduction measure a process that is n't expected to begin until tomorrow at the soonest
<unk> republicans expressed the hope that the <unk> would follow the lead of the <unk> which on <unk> agreed to drop a variety of spending measures and tax breaks that would have increased the fiscal n deficit
the market needs a strong signal that we serious about deficit reduction and the best way n to do that is for the <unk> of representatives to strip their bill of similar provisions <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> yesterday
the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> whose calculations determine whether the <unk> - <unk> targets are met estimated that the <unk> - passed deficit - reduction measure would cut the fiscal <unk> shortfall by n billion almost half of the <unk> <unk> <unk> estimate of <unk> billion
<unk> <unk> said that <unk> figure would still be enough to avoid permanent across - the-board cuts but added <unk> we getting very close to the margins here
no one in <unk> was willing to take the blame for provoking <unk> drop in the stock market
but some players were quick to seize the moment
before the sun had set on <unk> <unk> <unk> the supply - side chief economist of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> issued a statement attributing the drop in stock prices to the <unk> decision to postpone action on capital gains
investors who had been holding assets in anticipation of a more favorable time n to sell were spooked he said
there have been many preposterous reasons advanced to support a capital - gains tax cut <unk> <unk> said during his television appearance but i suggest <unk> that is perhaps more than any of the others

small investors matched their big institutional brethren in anxiety over the weekend but most seemed to be taking a philosophical approach and said n they were resigned to riding out the latest storm in the stock market
i not losing faith in the market said <unk> lawyer <unk> <unk> as he watched the market plunge on a big screen in front of a brokerage firm
but he not so sure about everyone else
i think n on <unk> the small investors are going to panic and sell predicted <unk> <unk> whose investments include <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> unit and several mutual funds
and i think n institutions are going to come in and buy
i going to hold on
if i sell now i take a big loss
some evinced an optimism that had been rewarded when they did n't flee the market in <unk>
oh i bet <unk> it be up n points on <unk> said <unk> <unk> a n retired housewife in <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> said <unk> her <unk> <unk> <unk> portfolio lost about one - third of its value following the <unk> <unk> crash but no one got discouraged and we gained that back and more
at the annual congress of the <unk> <unk> of investors <unk> at the <unk> <unk> hotel in <unk> the scene was calm
some n investors representing investor clubs from around the <unk> were attending when the market started to slide <unk>
but <unk> <unk> an official of the association said <unk> no special bulletins or emergency meetings of the investors clubs are planned
in fact some of the association members long - term buy - and-hold investors welcomed the drop in prices
we hope to take advantage of it said <unk> <unk> a member of a <unk> <unk> investors club
he has four stocks in mind n to buy if the prices drop to the level <unk> he wants
not everyone is reacting so calmly however and many wonder about the long - term implications of what is widely viewed as the cause of <unk> slide reluctance by banks to provide financing for a buy - out of <unk> <unk> parent of <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> investment banker said n the market drop is one of a tremendous number of signs that the leveraged take - out era is ending
there no question that there a general distaste for leverage among lenders
<unk> <unk> believes however that the market could be stabilized if <unk> investor <unk> <unk> steps back in to the <unk> bidding with an offer of <unk> a share
<unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> law student says n she generally skittish about the stock market and the takeover activity that seems to fuel it
i have this feeling that it built on sand she says n that the market rises but there no foundation to it
she and her husband pulled most of their investments out of the market after the <unk> crash although she still owns some <unk> stock
partly because of concern about the economy and partly because she recently quit her job as a legal assistant to go to school i think at this point n we want to be a lot more liquid
others wonder how many more of these shocks the small investor can stand
we all assumed n <unk> n was a one - time shot said <unk> <unk> attorney <unk> <unk>
we told the little guy n it could only happen once in a lifetime come on back
now it happening again
<unk> <unk> got out just before the <unk> crash and to his regret never went back even as the market soared
this time he ready to buy in when the panic wears off
still he adds we ca n't have this kind of thing happen very often
when the little guy gets frightened the big guys hurt badly
<unk> <unk> ca n't survive without the little guy
small investors have tiptoed back into the market following <unk> <unk> but mostly through mutual funds
discount brokerage customers have been in the market somewhat but not whole hog like they were two years ago says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman of the <unk> <unk> discount brokerage firm
<unk> <unk> senior vice president at <unk> <unk> <unk> says <unk> <unk> customers have been neutral to cautious recently about stocks
individual investors are still angry about program trading <unk> <unk> says <unk>
<unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> finance professor says n government regulators will have to more closely control program trading to win back the confidence of the small investor
but it not only the stock market that has some small investors worried
<unk> <unk> general sales manager of a <unk> dealership in <unk> said n he and his mother have some joint stock investments but the overall economy is his chief worry
these high rollers took a big bath today he said in his showroom which is within a few miles of the multi - million dollar homes of some of <unk> richest citizens
and i can tell you that a high roller is n't going to come in tomorrow and buy a <unk> <unk> by <unk>
and finally there were the gloaters
i got out in <unk>
everything said <unk> <unk> an <unk> <unk> plumbing contractor who was visiting <unk> and stopped by <unk> investments <unk> <unk> office
i just stopped by to see how much i would have lost
would <unk> <unk> ever get back in
are you kidding
when it comes to money once bitten <unk> times shy
the crowded field for notebook - sized computers is about to become a lot more crowded
<unk> <unk> <unk> long - awaited entry today into the notebook field is expected to put immediate heat on others in the market especially <unk> electronics <unk> the current market leader and on a swarm of promising start - ups
<unk> series of notebooks extends a trend toward downsizing in the personal computer market
one manufacturer already has produced a clipboard - sized computer called a notepad and two others have introduced even smaller palmtops
but those machines are still considered novelties with keyboards n only a munchkin could love and screens n to match
<unk> notebooks by contrast may be the first in their weight class not to skimp on features found in much bigger machines
analysts say n they faster and carry more memory than anything else of their size on the market and they priced aggressively at <unk> to n
all of this comes in a machine that weighs only six pounds and fits comfortably into most briefcases
in recent months <unk> competition including <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> all have introduced portables that weigh approximately the same and that are called notebooks perhaps misleadingly
one analyst noting that most such machines are about two inches thick takes exception to the name
this is n't quite a notebook i call it a phonebook he says
that ca n't be said of the <unk> notepad computer introduced a few weeks ago by <unk> systems <unk> a unit of <unk>
instead of a keyboard it features a writing surface an electronic pen and the ability to read block printing
at <unk> <unk> pounds it may be too ambitiously named but it nevertheless opens up the kind of marketing possibilities that make analysts froth
palmtops are n't far behind
<unk> <unk> <unk> introduced in <unk> two months ago and in the <unk> in early <unk> weighs less than a pound costs a mere n and runs on three <unk> batteries yet has the power to run some spreadsheets and word processing programs
some critics however say its ability to run commonplace programs is restricted by a limited memory
<unk> <unk> <unk> meanwhile has introduced a much more sophisticated palmtop that can run <unk> <unk> and other sophisticated software programs but costs five times as much
at stake is what <unk> <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> operations calls the <unk> <unk> of the computer industry the search for a real computer in a package so small n you can take it everywhere
the market is so new n nobody knows yet how big it can be
i had a lot of people trying to sell me services n to find out how big it is says <unk> <unk> director of marketing for <unk>
whether it n billion or n billion it does n't matter
it huge
consider the growth of portables which now comprise n of all personal computer sales
laptops generally anything under n pounds have become the fastest - growing personal computer segment with sales doubling this year
responding to that demand however has led to a variety of compromises
making computers smaller often means sacrificing memory
it also has precluded use of the faster more powerful microprocessors found in increasing numbers of desktop machines
size and weight considerations also have limited screen displays
the competitive sniping can get pretty petty at times
a <unk> spokesman for example criticizes the <unk> <unk> because it requires three batteries while the <unk> needs only two
both palmtops are dismissed by notebook makers who argue that they too small a problem <unk> <unk> also encountered in focus groups admits <unk> <unk> <unk> director of marketing
<unk> trying to avoid the gadget label responded with the tag line the <unk> pc a very big computer
despite the sniping few question the inevitability of the move to small machines that do n't make compromises
toward that end experts say n the real battle will take place between center - stage players like <unk> <unk> and now <unk>
<unk> new machines are considered a direct threat to start - up firms like <unk> <unk> which introduced in <unk> a computer that like <unk> uses an <unk> <unk> microprocessor and has a hard disk drive
but the <unk> product is twice as heavy and costs more than <unk>
<unk> announcement also spells trouble for <unk> which last year had n of the <unk> laptop market but recently agreed to sell its computer business to <unk> . des <unk> <unk> the french government - owned computer maker
<unk> holders will vote in <unk> on the proposed n million sale a price that could slip because it is pegged to <unk> share and sales
<unk> is already taking aim at <unk> market share
<unk> <unk> <unk> president and chief executive officer notes pointedly that <unk> <unk> <unk> uses an unconventional two - inch floppy disk whereas <unk> new machines use the more common <unk> <unk> disk
<unk> <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> <unk> simply shrugs off such criticism noting that <unk> <unk> floppies were also unconventional when they first replaced five - inch disks
we do n't look at it as not being a standard we look at it as a new standard he argues
analysts do n't see it that way
i ca n't imagine that you talk to anyone who wo n't tell you n this is dynamite for <unk> and a stopper for everyone else says <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
adds <unk> <unk> senior industry analyst for <unk> a high - technology market research firm we basically think that these are very hot products
the problem n <unk> is going to have is that they wo n't be able to make enough of them
<unk> machines include the <unk> <unk> floppy disk drive a backlit screen that is only n thick and an internal expansion slot for a modem in other words almost all the capabilities of a typical office machine
others undoubtedly will follow but most analysts believe <unk> <unk> has at least a six - month lead on the competition
<unk> line of portables for example features the n which is in the same weight class but is much slower and has less memory and the n which also uses a n microprocessor but which weighs almost twice as much and is three times the size
a third model marketed in <unk> may hit the <unk> by the end of the first quarter of n but by then analysts say <unk> <unk> will have established itself as one of three major players
what about big blue
<unk> <unk> machines <unk> analysts say <unk> has been burned twice in trying to enter the laptop market and shows no signs of trying to get into notebooks anytime soon
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> machines <unk> received <unk> <unk> contracts n to develop integrated circuits for use in space
<unk> contract totaled n million and <unk> n million
<unk> <unk> received a n million <unk> <unk> contract for developing cable systems for the <unk> <unk>
<unk> dynamics <unk> received a n million <unk> <unk> contract for electronic - warfare training sets
<unk> <unk> received an n million <unk> contract n to upgrade aircraft electronics
<unk> <unk> received an n million <unk> contract for helicopter engines
sharp increases in the price of fresh produce caused <unk> <unk> consumer price index to shoot up n from the previous month pushing the annual rate of inflation to n the <unk> <unk> of <unk> said <unk> <unk>
the monthly increase is the highest recorded in the past four years
the index which registered n at the end of <unk> has a base of n set in <unk> and is n't seasonally adjusted
prices have risen <unk> in the first nine months of the year outstripping both the initial <unk> inflation goal set by the government of socialist <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the second revised goal of <unk>
<unk> wholesale prices in <unk> rose n from a year earlier and were up n from the previous month the <unk> of <unk> announced <unk> <unk>
the wholesale price index stood at <unk> compared with a <unk> base of n
<unk>
what plunge
twenty - four <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> issues hit <unk> highs during <unk> trading despite the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> plunge
stocks of utilities held up relatively better than other market sectors during the sell - off
and among the issues hitting new highs were <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
other major issues hitting highs included <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> the big insurer
of course many more issues n hit new lows
these included <unk> <unk> machines <unk> which during <unk> session traded below <unk> a share for the first time since <unk> <unk>
<unk> closed at <unk> down <unk>
other new lows included <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> all of which are included in the industrial average
meanwhile two initial public offerings braved the cascading market in their maiden day of national over - the-counter trading <unk>
shares of <unk> <unk> an operator of fast - food restaurants closed at <unk> each up from its <unk> offering price and shares of <unk> <unk> plans <unk> a health - care consultant closed at <unk> up from its <unk> offering price
<unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> it acquired <unk> of the shares in <unk> <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> are being notified of the transactions the company said n
the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> advised <unk> last week that it would n't raise any objection to the acquisition of as much as <unk> of <unk> shares
the no . n auto maker disclosed last month that it wants to buy as much as <unk> of the british luxury - car maker the maximum allowed under current <unk> <unk> government restrictions
<unk> motors <unk> said n it had discussed the possibility of a joint venture with <unk> before <unk> began buying shares
<unk> said n it still is talking with <unk> about acquiring a minority interest
investors who bought stock with borrowed money that is on margin may be more worried than most following <unk> market drop
that because their brokers can require them to sell some shares or put up more cash n to enhance the collateral backing their loans
in <unk> n these margin calls were thought to have contributed to the downward spiral of the stock market
typically a margin call occurs when the price of a stock falls below <unk> of its original value
if the investor does n't put up the extra cash n to satisfy the call the brokerage firm may begin liquidating the securities
but some big brokerage firms said n they do n't expect major problems as a result of margin calls
margin calls since <unk> have been higher than usual but reasonable a spokesman for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said n
<unk> <unk> <unk> officials do n't expect margin calls to be as big a factor as in <unk> because fewer individual investors are buying stock on margin a spokesman said n
<unk> <unk> senior vice president at <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> - based discount brokerage firm said <unk> he did n't expect any immediate problems with margin calls for <unk> customers
he said <unk> <unk> had increased margin requirements so customers have more of a cushion
he added we learned a lesson in n about volatility
<unk> <unk> following rival <unk> <unk> lead said n it is backing out of frequent - flier programs with three airlines
the <unk> <unk> <unk> car - rental company said <unk> it wo n't renew contracts with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> unit <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> unit and <unk> airlines at the end of this year
but it remains involved in programs with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> unit and <unk> <unk> <unk>
industry estimates put <unk> annual cost of all five programs at between n million and n million
a spokesman for <unk> would n't specify the costs but said n the three airlines being dropped account for far less than half of the total
<unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> systems <unk> of <unk> both said n they had no plans to follow suit
in fact <unk> indicated <unk> it saw some benefit to staying involved in these programs in which renters earn frequent - flier miles and fliers can get car - rental discounts
i can not see how this news by <unk> and <unk> can not benefit <unk> programs said <unk> <unk> <unk> vice president marketing planning
<unk> and <unk> are two of the five airlines with which <unk> has agreements
<unk> also participates in the <unk> frequent - flier program along with four other airlines including <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> unit
a month ago <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> said that it would drop its marketing agreements at year end with <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> airlines and <unk> airlines and that pacts with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> also would be ended sometime after <unk> n
at the time <unk> said <unk> its annual fees to those airlines amounted to n million and that the value of redeemed awards topped n million
analysts and competitors however doubt <unk> the numbers were that high
<unk> said <unk> its frequent - flier costs are substantially below <unk> level
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> vice president of marketing said n the proliferation and costs attached to frequent - flier programs have significantly diminished their value
this year has been difficult for both <unk> and <unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> car - rental industry analyst at <unk> <unk> <unk>
they been looking to get their costs down and this is a fairly sensible way n to do it he said
<unk> <unk> is cutting the <unk> <unk> <unk> down to one hour from its current n minutes
<unk> insisted n the move was n't a setback for the program which is the network first entry into the late - night talk show format since <unk>
i have every intention of making this the best possible show and having it run one hour is the best way to it said <unk> <unk> who was named vice president of late night entertainment in <unk>
this will raise the energy level of the show
<unk> will continue to program action - adventure shows n to follow the <unk> hour
but <unk> <unk> will extend its four - hour <unk> by n minutes and begin at <unk> a.m
the show despite a promising start has slipped badly in the weekly ratings as compiled by <unk> <unk> <unk> finishing far below tonight on <unk> a unit of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on <unk> - <unk> a unit of <unk> <unk> <unk>
further fractioning the late - night audience is the addition of the <unk> <unk> <unk> syndicated by <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> computers <unk> preparing to fight with <unk> <unk> machines <unk> for a piece of the mainframe business said n it expects to post higher revenue and earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter ended <unk> n
<unk> said <unk> it expects to report revenue of about n million and earnings of n cents to n cents a share
the results which are in line with analysts estimates reflect a continued improvement in our <unk> business said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> chief executive officer
in the year - earlier period <unk> reported net income of n million or n cents a share on revenue of n million
<unk> expects to report the full results for the quarter next week
analysts have predicted that the <unk> <unk> company will report revenue of n million to n million and earnings of n cents to n cents a share
commenting on the results for the quarter <unk> <unk> said n the strength of the company domestic business came as a surprise to him noting that sales in every region of the <unk> exceeded our plan
the company <unk> performance was helped by a record quarter for new customers he said n
<unk> makes fault - tolerant computers machines with built - in backup systems that run stock exchanges networks of automatic tellers and other complex computer systems
tomorrow the company is scheduled to announce its most powerful computer ever which for the first time will bring it into direct competition with makers of mainframe computers
<unk> new high - end computer is called <unk>
prices for the machine which can come in various configurations are n million to n million
analysts expect the new computer to wrest a hefty slice of business away from <unk> the longtime leader in mainframes
we believe <unk> they could siphon perhaps two to three billion dollars from <unk> over the next few years said <unk> <unk> <unk> an analyst at the <unk> group
that will spur <unk> growth
i be disappointed if the company grew by less than n next year said <unk> <unk> an analyst at <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is expected to respond to <unk> <unk> by discounting its own mainframes which analysts say n are roughly three times the price of a comparable system from <unk>
obviously <unk> can give bigger discounts to users immediately said <unk> <unk>
but <unk> <unk> questions whether that will be enough to stop <unk> first mainframe from taking on some of the functions that large organizations previously sought from big blue machines
the answer is n't price reductions but new systems he said
nevertheless <unk> faces a variety of challenges the biggest being that customers generally view the company computers as complementary to <unk> mainframes
even <unk> <unk> is reluctant to abandon this notion insisting that <unk> new machines are n't replacements for <unk> mainframes
we after a little bigger niche he said
do n't jump yet
the stock market swoon may turn out to be good news for the economy
in one wild hour of trading the market managed to accomplish what the <unk> administration has been trying to do unsuccessfully for weeks
it is forcing the <unk> <unk> to ease its grip on credit and it took the wind out of a previously irrepressible dollar
the resulting decline in interest rates and the value of the dollar could reinvigorate american business indeed the entire economy
this may sound strangely optimistic
after all until a few years ago the stock market was viewed as a barometer of the national economy
when it went down by all tradition the economy followed
that has changed partly because the two years following the worst stock - market plunge in history have been reasonably comfortable
the <unk> crash was a false alarm however you view it says <unk> <unk> of <unk> economist <unk> <unk>
the market seems increasingly disconnected from the rest of the nation
its spasms ca n't be traced to fundamental business conditions nor do they appear to presage major shifts in the economy
the market today has a life of its own <unk> <unk> chairman of <unk> <unk> machines <unk> said <unk>
there nothing rational about this kind of action
of course the health of the economy will be threatened if the market continues to dive this week
sharply falling stock prices do reduce consumer wealth damage business confidence and discourage the foreign investors upon whom the <unk> now relies for financial sustenance
the financial - services industry was battered by the <unk> crash
what more although the stock market is far less overvalued today than two years ago the <unk> economy is weaker
growth is slower
profits are softer
debt burdens are heavier
but if the stock market does n't continue to plummet the beneficial effects of lower interest rates and a lower dollar may well dominate
the <unk> which until <unk> had been resisting moves n to ease credit is now poised to pour money into the economy if needed to soothe the markets
fed officials may protest that this does n't necessarily mean a fundamental change in their interest - rate policies
but the experience of the <unk> crash suggests <unk> the <unk> is likely to bring down short - term interest rates in its effort to calm markets
anticipating the <unk> move money traders lowered a key interest rate known as the <unk> funds rate to n late <unk> down from <unk> the day before
tiny movements in the rate which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans are usually among the few visible tracks that the <unk> leaves on the monetary markets
the dollar also began to decline <unk> as the stock market plunge caused some investors to reassess their desire to invest in the <unk>
<unk> officials have been arguing for months that the dollar strength was out of whack with economic fundamentals threatening to extinguish the export boom that has sustained manufacturers for several years
the market drop has now apparently convinced foreign investors that the <unk> was right about the overpriced dollar
a modest drop in the dollar only a modest one mind you would be welcomed by the <unk>
that was n't the case in <unk> when the dollar was so weak that some economists and government officials seriously worried that it might collapse producing panic among foreign investors and diminishing the flow of foreign capital to the <unk>
another big difference between <unk> and <unk> is n't so comforting
in the third quarter of <unk> the economy spurted at an inflation - adjusted annual rate of n
the consensus among economists is that it grew a much more sluggish n in the third quarter of <unk> which ended two weeks ago
the plunge in stock prices is happening at a time when the economy has already slowed down says <unk> economist <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> forecasting company
a lot of pent - up demand is gone
consumer spending did drop in the months following <unk> <unk> <unk> but only slightly and for a short period of time recalls <unk> <unk> <unk> a longtime student of business cycles
that was offset by strength elsewhere
the effects were much less severe and less prolonged than some had feared or expected n
today he frets exports and business investment spending may be insufficient to pick up the slack if stock prices sink this week and if consumers retrench in reaction
what more the corporate borrowing binge has n't abated in the past two years
we had two more years of significant accumulation of debt just at the time when earnings are being squeezed <unk> <unk> notes
the more a company relies on borrowed money the greater its sensitivity to an economic slowdown
a company with a strong balance sheet can withstand an unanticipated storm a highly leveraged company may end up in bankruptcy court
the <unk> of course knows that very well hence its readiness to pump credit into the economy this morning
but in the process the <unk> risks reigniting inflation
even before <unk> events <unk> <unk> economist <unk> <unk> was arguing that the <unk> wo n't be able to live up to its tough words on eliminating inflation because of its responsibility to protect fragile financial markets banks and highly leveraged corporations
the biggest threat on the economic horizon right now is n't recession he reasons n it an outbreak of uncontrolled inflation
in the end the <unk> collapse suggested <unk> the economy does n't move in lockstep with stock prices
the economy does however depend on the confidence of businesses consumers and foreign investors
a panic on <unk> <unk> does n't exactly inspire confidence
surveys suggested that consumer confidence was high before <unk>
a n drop is n't likely to make much of a dent multiply that a few times over though and it will
if the reactions of executives gathered <unk> at <unk> <unk> <unk> for the <unk> <unk> meetings are typical business leaders were n't overly rattled by <unk> decline
and if foreign investors become a tad more cautious well the dollar recent strength suggests that the <unk> can stand it
on the bottom line the most comforting fact for the economic outlook is that we been through this before
two years ago about the only point of comparison was the <unk> crash and the subsequent <unk>
the doomsayers had a receptive audience
the prosperity that followed <unk> <unk> permits a more optimistic view today
at the very least the establishment here is taking comfort from the nation success in handling the last go - around
as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> observed yesterday the <unk> avoided a meltdown last time
they are more sophisticated this time
the chemical industry is expected to report that profits eroded in the third quarter because of skidding prices in the commodity end of the business
producers of commodity chemicals the basic chemicals produced in huge volumes for other manufacturers have seen sharp inventory cutting by buyers
once the chief beneficiaries of the industry now fading boom these producers also will be reporting against exceptionally strong performances in the <unk> third quarter
for some of these companies this will be the first quarter with year - to-year negative comparisons says <unk> <unk> a chemical industry analyst at <unk> <unk> <unk>
this could be the first of five or six down quarters
perhaps most prominent <unk> <unk> <unk> which as of midyear had racked up eight consecutive record quarters is expected to report that profit decreased in the latest quarter from a year earlier if only by a shade
<unk> <unk> has aggressively diversified into specialty chemicals and pharmaceuticals the company still has a big stake in polyethylene which is used in packaging and housewares
analysts third - quarter estimates for the <unk> <unk> company are between <unk> a share and n a share compared with <unk> a year ago when profit was n million on sales of n billion
a <unk> spokeswoman declined to comment on the estimates
at the investment firm of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the commodity - chemical segment is seen pulling down overall profit for n companies representative of the whole industry by <unk> to n
you will find the commodities off more than the others and the diversified companies about even or slightly better says <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> analyst
<unk> <unk> <unk> projects that <unk> of the <unk> companies n it follows will report lower profit
most of the <unk> have big commodity - chemical operations
still some industry giants are expected to report continuing gains largely because so much of their business is outside commodity chemicals
<unk> <unk> <unk> is thought to have had steady profit growth in white pigments fibers and polymers
moreover the <unk> <unk> company is helped when prices weaken on the commodity chemicals n it buys for its own production needs such as ethylene
analysts are divided over whether <unk> <unk> will report much of a gain in the latest quarter from its <unk> <unk> oil company
the estimates for <unk> <unk> range from <unk> to n a share
in the <unk> third quarter the company earned n million or <unk> a share on sales of n billion
<unk> <unk> declined to comment
<unk> <unk> too is expected to continue reporting higher profit even though its sales of crop chemicals were hurt in the latest quarter by drought in northern <unk> and the western <unk>
the <unk> <unk> - based company is expected to report again that losses in its <unk> <unk> <unk> pharmaceutical business are narrowing
<unk> continued to operate in the red through the first half of the year but <unk> has said n it expects <unk> to post a profit for all of <unk>
most estimates for <unk> run between <unk> and <unk> a share
a year ago the company posted third - quarter profit of n million or <unk> a share on sales of n billion
<unk> declined to comment
but the commodity - chemical producers are caught on the downside of a pricing cycle
by some accounts on <unk> <unk> and in the industry the inventory reductions are near an end which may presage firmer demand
but doubters say n growing production capacity could keep pressure on prices into the early n

the economy temperature will be taken from several vantage points this week with readings on trade output housing and inflation
the most troublesome report may be the <unk> merchandise trade deficit due out tomorrow
the trade gap is expected to widen to about <unk> billion from <unk> <unk> billion according to a survey by <unk> <unk> a unit of <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> report on the <unk> consumer price index is expected to rise although not as sharply as the <unk> gain reported <unk> in the producer price index
that gain was being cited as a reason n the stock market was down early in <unk> session before it got started on its reckless n plunge
economists are divided as to how much manufacturing strength they expect to see in <unk> reports on industrial production and capacity utilization also due tomorrow
meanwhile <unk> housing starts due <unk> are thought to have inched upward
there a possibility of a surprise in the trade report said <unk> <unk> <unk> director of research at <unk>
a widening of the deficit if it were combined with a stubbornly strong dollar would exacerbate trade problems but the dollar weakened <unk> as stocks plummeted
in any event <unk> <unk> and many others say that the easy gains in narrowing the trade gap have already been made
<unk> is definitely going to be more politically sensitive over the next six or seven months as improvement begins to slow he said
exports are thought to have risen strongly in <unk> but probably not enough to offset the jump in imports economists said
views on manufacturing strength are split between economists who read <unk> low level of factory job growth as a sign of a slowdown and those who use the somewhat more comforting total employment figures in their calculations
the wide range of estimates for the industrial output number underscores the differences the forecasts run from a drop of <unk> to an increase of <unk> according to <unk>
a rebound in energy prices which helped push up the producer price index is expected to do the same in the consumer price report
the consensus view expects a <unk> increase in the <unk> <unk> after a flat reading in <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> an economist for <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> is among those expecting a more moderate gain in the <unk> than in prices at the producer level
auto prices had a big effect in the <unk> and at the <unk> level they wo n't he said
food prices are expected to be unchanged but energy costs jumped as much as <unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> economist at <unk> <unk> <unk>
he also says n he thinks <unk> core inflation which excludes the volatile food and energy prices was strong last month
he expects a gain of as much as <unk> in core inflation after a summer of far smaller increases
housing starts are expected to quicken a bit from <unk> annual pace of <unk> units
economists say n an <unk> rebound in permits for multifamily units signaled an increase in <unk> starts though activity remains fairly modest by historical standards

assuming n the stock market does n't crash again and completely discredit yuppies and trading rooms american television audiences in a few months may be seeing <unk> concept of both
<unk> <unk> is a weekly series that premiered here three weeks ago amid unprecedented hype by its producer <unk> <unk>
the early episodes make you long for a rerun of the crash of <unk>
let make that <unk> just to be sure
according to the program publicity prospectus <unk> <unk> set at <unk> <unk> a fictional mid - sized securities firm with n million capital follows the fortunes of a close - knit team of young high - flying dealers hired for their particular blend of style genius and energy
but with all the money and glamour of high finance come the relentless pressures to do well pressure to pull off another million before lunch pressure to anticipate the market by a fraction of a second
you need n't be a high - powered securities lawyer to realize n the prospectus is guilty of less than full disclosure
the slickly produced series has been criticized by <unk> financial cognoscenti as inaccurate in detail but its major weakness is its unrealistic depiction of the characters professional and private lives
turned loose in <unk> <unk> trading room the yuppie dealers do little right
judging by the money lost and mistakes made in the early episodes <unk> <unk> capital should be just about exhausted by the final n week
in the opening episode we learn that <unk> a junior bond trader has indeed pulled off another million before lunch
trouble is n she has lost it just as quickly
rather than keep the loss a secret from the outside world <unk> blabs about it to a sandwich man while ordering lunch over the phone
little chance that <unk> <unk> is going to recoup today
traders spend the morning frantically selling bonds in the belief that the <unk> monthly trade figures will look lousy
ah perfidious <unk>
the trade figures turn out well and all those recently unloaded bonds spurt in price
so much for anticipating the market by a fraction of a second
and a large slice of the first episode is devoted to efforts to get rid of some nearly worthless japanese bonds since when is anything japanese nearly worthless nowadays
surprisingly <unk> <unk> survives the week only to have a senior executive innocently bumble his way into becoming the target of a criminal insider trading investigation
instead of closing ranks to protect the firm reputation the executive internal rivals led by a loutish american demand his resignation
the plot is thwarted when the firm major stockholder kelp farming on the other side of the globe hurries home to support the executive
but the investigation continues
if you can swallow the premise that the rewards for such ineptitude are six - figure salaries you still are left puzzled because few of the yuppies consume very conspicuously
in fact few consume much of anything
two share a house almost devoid of furniture
<unk> lives in a hotel room and although she drives a canary - colored <unk> she has n't time n to clean or repair it the beat - up vehicle can be started only with a huge pair of pliers because the ignition key has broken off in the lock
and it takes <unk> the obligatory ladies man of the cast until the third episode to get past first base with any of his prey
perhaps the explanation for these anomalies is that class - conscious <unk> is n't ready to come to terms with the wealth created by the <unk> free - enterprise regime
after all this is n't old money but new money and in many cases young money
this attitude is clearly illustrated in the treatment of <unk> the trading room most flamboyant character
yuppily enough he lives in a lavishly furnished converted church wears designer clothes and drives an antique car
but apparently to make him palatable even lovable to the masses the script inflates pony - tailed <unk> into an eccentric genius master of <unk> chinese dialects
he takes his wash to the laundromat where he meets a punky french girl who dupes him into providing a home for her pet piranha and then promptly steals his car and dumps it in <unk>
in producing and promoting <unk> <unk> <unk> has spent about as much as <unk> <unk> loses on a good day
the production costs are a not inconsiderable n million n million and would have been much higher had not the cost of the trading floor set been absorbed in the budget of dealers an earlier made - for-tv movie
another half million quid went for a volley of full - page advertisements in six major british newspapers and for huge posters in the <unk> subway
these expenses create a special incentive for <unk> <unk> producers to flog it or a <unk> - oriented version of it in <unk>
<unk> <unk> marketing agent <unk> <unk> is preparing to do just that
he is discreetly hopeful citing three <unk> comedy series three <unk> too <unk> for <unk> and <unk> it out that had british antecedents
perhaps without realizing it <unk> <unk> simultaneously has put his finger on the problem and an ideal solution <unk> <unk> should have been a comedy a worthy sequel to the screwball <unk> <unk> on movies of the <unk>
the seeds already are in the script
the first episode concluded with a marvelously cute scene in which the trading - room crew minded a baby the casualty of a broken marriage at the firm
and many in the young cast bear striking resemblances to american tv and movie personalities known for light roles
<unk> <unk> looks like a young <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who plays <unk> could pass for <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is a passable <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> could easily double for <unk> <unk> the blank - faced foil of the <unk> boys comedies
so ok kids everybody on stage for <unk> on trading the cast is frantically searching the office for misplaced japanese bonds that suddenly have soared in value because <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> has just bought the <unk> <unk>
the pressure is too much for <unk> <unk> who slaps a security guard
he backflips into a desktop computer terminal which explodes covering <unk> <unk> face with microchips
and all the while the bonds are in the baby diaper
it should run forever
<unk> <unk> is senior correspondent in the <unk> <unk> bureau
<unk> - <unk> <unk> of <unk> gave details of its financing plans for its proposed n billion acquisition of <unk> <unk> <unk> in amended filings with insurance regulators in the nine <unk> states where <unk> operates
the proposed acquisition is part of <unk> <unk> <unk> unfriendly takeover attempt for <unk> <unk> <unk> the british tobacco retailing paper and financial services concern that is parent of <unk> <unk> - based <unk>
in an attempt to appease <unk> regulators concern over a <unk> acquisition of <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> agreed to sell <unk> to <unk> if he is successful in acquiring <unk>
as part of the agreement <unk> agreed to invest n billion in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> acquisition vehicle
of the total <unk> billion n to be paid to <unk> by <unk> about <unk> billion will come from available resources of <unk> parent <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> billion will be in the form of notes issued by <unk> and the remaining n billion will be in long - term bank loans
in an interview <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman and chief executive officer of <unk> said <unk> his group has already obtained assurances from a group of banks led by <unk> <unk> de <unk> that they can provide the loan portion of the financing
the other banking companies in the group are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> he said n
<unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> - <unk> <unk> has more than <unk> billion of non - strategic assets that we can and will sell to help pay off debt from the acquisition
he said <unk> the assets n to be sold would be non - insurance assets including a beer company and a real estate firm and would n't include any pieces of <unk>
we wo n't put any burden on <unk> he said
the amended filings also point out that under a new agreement <unk> has an absolute obligation to sell <unk> to <unk> upon an acquisition of <unk>
we hope that with what we did the regulators will not need to evaluate <unk> and they can directly look at the agreement with us because <unk> wo n't be an owner of farmers at anytime <unk> <unk> said
any change of control in <unk> needs approval of the insurance commissioners in the nine states where <unk> and its related companies are incorporated
the amended filings were required because of the new agreement between <unk> and <unk> and to reflect the extension that <unk> <unk> received last month under british takeover rules to complete his proposed acquisition
<unk> dropped its initial <unk> billion n billion takeover bid after it received the extension but said n it would launch a new bid if and when the propsed sale of <unk> to <unk> receives regulatory approval
a spokesman for <unk> said of the amended filings that it would appear that nothing substantive has changed
the new financing structure is still a very - highly leveraged one and <unk> still plans to take out <unk> of farmers earnings as dividends to service their debt
that dividend is almost double the <unk> currently taken out of <unk> by <unk> the spokesman added n
it would have severe implications for farmers policy holders
to fend off <unk> <unk> advances <unk> has proposed a sweeping restructuring that would pare it to a tobacco and financial services concern
dismal sales at <unk> <unk> <unk> dragged the <unk> car and truck market down below year - ago levels in early <unk> the first sales period of the <unk> model year
the eight major domestic auto makers sold <unk> <unk> <unk> - made cars in the first <unk> days of <unk> a n drop from a year earlier
domestically built truck sales were down n to n pickups vans and sport utility vehicles
the heavy use of incentives to clear out n models appears to have taken the steam at least initially out of n model sales which began officially <unk> n
this appears particularly true at <unk> which had strong sales in <unk> and <unk> but saw its early <unk> car and truck results fall n from last year unusually high level
overall sales of all domestic - made vehicles fell n from a year ago
without <unk> overall sales for the other <unk> automakers were roughly flat with <unk> results
some of the <unk> auto makers have already adopted incentives on many n models but they may have to broaden their programs to keep sales up
we created a condition where without incentives it a tough market said <unk> <unk> sales manager for <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
car sales fell to a seasonally adjusted annual selling rate of n million vehicles the lowest since <unk> n
the poor performance contrasts with a robust selling rate of almost eight million last month
furthermore dealers contacted late last week said n they could n't see any immediate impact on sales of <unk> steep market decline
<unk> domestic car sales dropped <unk> and its domestic trucks were down an even steeper n from the same period a year ago
all of the <unk> divisions except <unk> showed big declines
<unk> posted a <unk> increase despite new competition from <unk> the fledging luxury - car division of <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> sales were n't available the cars are imported and <unk> reports their sales only at month - end
the sales drop for the no . n car maker may have been caused in part by the end in <unk> of dealer incentives that <unk> offered in addition to consumer rebates and low - interest financing a company spokesman said n
last year <unk> had a different program in place that continued rewarding dealers until all the n models had been sold
aside from <unk> other car makers posted generally mixed results
<unk> <unk> <unk> had a n drop in domestic car sales but a n increase in domestic truck sales
<unk> <unk> had a n drop in car sales echoing its generally slow performance all year
however sales of trucks including the company popular minivans rose n
<unk> <unk> <unk> sales of domestically built vehicles plunged n from a year earlier
<unk> plant in <unk> <unk> was gearing up to build n model accords a <unk> spokesman said n
we really confident n everything will bounce back to normal he added
separately <unk> said <unk> firm prices on its <unk> domestic cars and minivans will rise an average of <unk> over comparably equipped n models
firm prices were generally in line with the tentative prices announced earlier this fall
at that time <unk> said <unk> base prices which are n't adjusted for equipment changes would rise between <unk> and <unk> on most vehicle
a totals include only vehicle sales reported in period
c domestic
d percentage change is greater than <unk>
x there were n selling days in the most recent period and <unk> a year earlier
percentage differences based on daily sales rate rather than sales volume
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> years old was named president and chief executive officer of the <unk> <unk> <unk> subsidiary
<unk> <unk> had been a consultant to the subsidiary rocket - propulsion operations

it also has interests in military electronics and electro - optics marine transportation and machinery used to make food and beverage cans
it was n't so long ago that a radio network funded by the <unk> <unk> and originally by the <unk> <unk> <unk> was accused by officials here of employing propagandists imperialists and spies
now the network has opened a news bureau in the hungarian capital
employees held an open house to celebrate and even hung out a sign <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
i think n this is a victory for the radio says <unk> de <unk> a n former hungarian refugee who works in the <unk> <unk> <unk> headquarters as deputy director of the hungarian service
in fact the network hopes to set up offices in <unk> and anywhere else in the <unk> <unk> that will have it
but the rapid changes brought on by glasnost and open borders are altering the network life in more ways than one
in fact <unk> <unk> <unk> is in danger of suffering from its success
while the network currently can operate freely in <unk> so can others
in addition competition for listeners is getting tougher in many ways than when broadcasting here was strictly controlled
instead of being denounced as an evil agent of imperialism <unk> <unk> <unk> is more likely to draw the criticism that its programs are too tame even boring
they have a lot n to do these days to compete with hungarian radio says <unk> <unk> a computer - science student at the <unk> <unk> in <unk>
the hungarian radio reporters seem better informed and more critical about about what going on here
indeed <unk> is in the midst of a media explosion
boys on busy street corners peddle newspapers of every political stripe
newsstands are packed with a colorful array of magazines
radio and television are getting livelier and bolder
the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> broadcast over hungarian airwaves though only a few hours a day each in hungarian
australian press magnate <unk> <unk> has bought <unk> stakes in two popular and gossipy hungarian newspapers while <unk> <unk> <unk> has let it be known here that he is thinking about similar moves
but <unk> <unk> <unk> does n't plan to fade away
with its mission for free speech and the capitalist way the network staff says <unk> it still has plenty n to do in <unk> and in the great <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> and its sister station for the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> say <unk> they wo n't cut back their more than n hours of daily broadcasts
they are still an important source of news for n million listeners in n exotic tongues from bulgarian and belorussian to <unk> and <unk>
the establishment of its first bureau in <unk> <unk> territory shows the depth of some of the changes in <unk> <unk>
months before the decision by the <unk> <unk> <unk> to rename itself <unk> and try to look more appealing to voters the country rulers were trying to look more hospitable
it proved a perfect time for <unk> <unk> <unk> to ask for permission to set up office
not only did the <unk> <unk> of <unk> affairs approve <unk> <unk> <unk> new location but the <unk> of telecommunications did something even more amazing they found us four phone lines in central <unk> says <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> correspondent who helped organize the <unk> location
that is a miracle
it a far cry from the previous treatment of the network which had to overcome jamming of its frequencies and intimidation of local correspondents who filed reports to the network by phone secret messengers or letters
in fact some of the network hungarian listeners say n they owe <unk> <unk> <unk> loyalty because it was responsible in many ways for keeping hope alive through what one writer here calls the <unk> ages of the <unk> <unk>
during the past four years many of us have sat up until late at night listening to our radios says the writer
there were some very brave broadcasts
the listeners too had to be brave
through much of the post - <unk> <unk> <unk> period listening to western broadcasts was a crime in <unk>
when we listen to the <unk> station my mother still gets nervous says a <unk> translator
she wants to turn down the volume and close the curtains
now the toughest competition for <unk> <unk> <unk> comes during the late - night slot
hungarian radio often saves its most politically outspoken broadcasts for around midnight
television which most of the time is considered rather tame has entered the running with a new program the end of the day which comes on after n p.m
it is a talk show with opposition leaders and political experts who discuss <unk> domestic problems as well as foreign affairs
those who want to hear even more radical views have to get up at five on <unk> morning for <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk>
the competitive spirit is clearly influencing <unk> <unk> <unk> which is trying to beef up programs
the <unk> office plans to hire free - lance reporters to cover the latest happenings in hungarian country towns from <unk> in the west to <unk> in the east
the hungarian service has a daily n news show called <unk> with international and domestic news plus a daily news review of opinions from around the world
there also a host of new programs trying to lighten up on the traditional diet of politics
a daily n program called the <unk> of <unk> tries to find interesting tidbits of lighthearted news and gossip from around the world
there a program for women and a science show
and to attract younger listeners <unk> <unk> <unk> intersperses the latest in western rock groups
the <unk> <unk> boys are big this year in <unk>
we are starving for all the news says <unk> <unk> the student
every moment we want to know everything about the world
proposals for government - operated national service like influenza flare up from time to time depress the resistance of the body politic run their course and seem to disappear only to mutate and afflict public life anew
the disease metaphor comes to mind of course not as an aspersion on the advocates of national service
rather it is born of frustration with having to combat constantly changing strains of a statist idea that one thought n had been eliminated in the early n along with smallpox
it is back with us again in the form of legislation to pay volunteers under a <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> a proposal with a serious shot at congressional passage this fall
why does the national - service virus keep coming back
perhaps it is because utopian nostalgia evokes both military experience and the social gospel
if only we could get <unk> wastrel youth into at least a psychic uniform we might be able to teach self - discipline again and revive the spirit of giving
a quarter of a century ago national service was promoted as a way of curing the manifest inequities of the draft by of all things expanding the draft
those of us who resisted the idea then suspect today that an obligation of government service for all young people is still the true long - term aim of many national - service backers despite their protests that present plans contain no coercion
choice of the volunteer military in the <unk> seemed to doom national service as much as the draft
but the virus was kept alive in sociology departments until a couple of years ago when it again was let loose
this time it attempted to invade two connected problems the rising cost of higher education and the rising expense to the federal government of educational grants and loans
why not keep and even expand the loans and grants the advocates reasoned but require some form of service from each recipient
military service moreover could be a national - service option
thus undoubtedly it was hoped that the new strain of national service would prove contagious infecting patriotic conservatives pay - as-you-go moderates and idealistic liberals
the <unk> <unk> <unk> a centrist group sponsoring the plan surely thought n it might help the party to attract support especially among college students and their parents
a provision allowing grants to be applied to first - home purchases was added to appeal to those who had had enough of schooling
the <unk> plan envisaged volunteers planting trees emptying bedpans tutoring children and assisting librarians for <unk> a week tax free plus medical care
with a tax - free n voucher payment at the end of each year the volunteers would be making a wage comparable to <unk> a year
mind you most of the volunteers would be unskilled <unk> to n some not even high school graduates and many saving money by living at home
they would be doing better financially under national service than many taxpayers working at the same kinds of jobs and perhaps supporting families
as it happened political resistance developed among educational and minority interests that count on the present education grant system so the national - service devotees decided to abandon the supposedly crucial principle of give in order to get
opposition to national service from the <unk> which wants to protect its own recruitment process also led to the military - service option being dropped
clearly a new rationale for national service had to be cooked up
what better place <unk> to turn than <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that great stove of government expansionism where many a stagnant pot of porridge is kept on the back burner until it can be brought forward and presented as nouvelle cuisine
in this case the new recipe for national service called for throwing many assorted legislative leftovers into one kettle a demonstration project for educational aid particularly satisfying to the <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> a similar demonstration program for youth conservation a la <unk> <unk> <unk> a competitive grants program to states n to spark youth and senior citizen volunteer projects a <unk> specialty a community service work - study program for students pleasing to the palate of <unk> <unk> <unk> among others plus engorgement of the <unk> volunteer program and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> programs
before the menu is printed the <unk> may add more ingredients also changing the initial price now posted at some n million
it is widely known that too many cooks spoil the broth but that wisdom does not necessarily reflect the view of the cooks especially if they are senators
the omnibus bill coming out of <unk> may be unwholesome glop but the assorted chefs are happy and the restaurant is pushing the dish very hard
the aroma of patronage is in the air
is the voluntary sector so weak that it needs such unsolicited assistance
on the contrary it is as robust as ever
according to the <unk> <unk> american adults contribute an average of two hours a week of service while financial contributions to charity in the n have risen <unk> adjusted for inflation
even if government does see various unmet needs national service is not the way n to meet them
if we want to support students we might adopt the idea used in other countries of offering more scholarships based on something called scholarship rather than on the government idea of service
or we might provide a tax credit for working students
what we do not need to do is start a war and then try to justify it by creating a <unk> <unk>
to the extent n we lack manpower n to staff menial jobs in hospitals for example we should raise pay pursue labor - saving technology or allow more legal immigration rather than overpay high school graduates as short - term workers and cause resentment among permanent workers paid lesser amounts to do the same jobs
will national service in the current highly politicized and opportunistic form exert enough appeal to get adopted
not necessarily
polls show wide generalized support for some vague concept of service but the bill now under discussion lacks any passionate public backing
nonetheless <unk> democrats are organizing a roll of supporting associations societies and councils some of which may hope to receive the paid volunteers
so far the president seems ill - disposed to substitute any of the omnibus for his own free - standing proposal to endow a <unk> of <unk> foundation with n million to inform citizens of all ages and exhort them to genuine volunteerism
however even this admirable plan could become objectionable if the <unk> <unk> gives in to congressional democratic pressure to add to the scope of the president initiative or to involve the independent foundation in brokering federal funds for volunteer projects
there no need for such concessions
the omnibus can be defeated the virus controlled and real service protected
national service the utopian idea still wo n't go away then of course but the millions of knee - socked youth performing works of civic content will be mobilized only in the imagination of their progenitors
<unk> <unk> is a fellow at the <unk> - based <unk> <unk>
this article is adapted from remarks at a <unk> <unk> conference on national service in which <unk> <unk> also participated

he succeeds his father <unk> <unk> <unk> who founded the company and remains chairman

the debate over <unk> <unk> has begun again
after a decade in which more than <unk> localities established their own service or conservation corps and dozens of school systems made community service a prerequisite to high - school graduation the focus has shifted to <unk>
at least n bills proposing one or another national program were introduced in <unk> this spring
one co - sponsored by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> would have restricted federal college subsidies to students who had served
an omnibus bill assembled by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and including some diluted <unk> - <unk> provisions along with proposals by fellow <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> has been reported out of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
it might well win <unk> passage
<unk> <unk> has outlined his own <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> plan though its details remain to be specified
what is one to think of all this
<unk> and special interests govern some responses
people eager to have youth pay their dues to society favor service proposals preferably mandatory ones
so do those who seek a re - energized concept of citizenship a concept imposing stern obligations as well as conferring rights
then there are instinctive opponents
to libertarians mandatory service is an abomination and voluntary systems are illegitimate uses of tax money
devotees of the market question the value of the work <unk> national service would perform
if the market wo n't pay for it they argue it ca n't be worth its cost
elements of the left are also reflexively opposed they see service as a cover for the draft or fear the regimentation of youth or want to see rights enlarged not obligations
but what about those of us whose views are not predetermined by formula or ideology
how should we think about national service
let begin by recognizing a main source of confusion national service has no agreed meaning
would service be voluntary or compulsory
short or long
part - time or full - time
<unk> or unpaid
would participants live at home and work nearby or live in barracks and work on public lands
what kinds of work would they do
what does national mean
would the program be run by the federal government by local governments or by private voluntary organizations
and who would serve
only males as with the draft or both sexes
<unk> only or all ages
middle - class people or poor people or a genuine cross - section
many or few
those are not trivial questions and the label national service answers none of them
then how should we think about national service
as a starting point here are five propositions n consider the ingredients not the name
ignore national service in the abstract consider specific proposals
they will differ in crucial ways
<unk> <unk> should be service
as commonly understood service implies sacrifice
it involves accepting risk or giving up income or deferring a career
it follows that proposals like <unk> - <unk> whose benefits to enrollees are worth some n a year do not qualify
there is a rationale for such bills <unk> subsidies to college students amount to a <unk> <unk> without the <unk> arguably those benefits should be earned not given
but the earnings exceed by <unk> the average income of young high - school graduates with full - time jobs
why call that service
n <unk> is fine compulsion is not
compelled service is unconstitutional
it is also unwise and unenforceable
who will throw several hundred thousand refusers in jail each year
but through tax policy and in other ways the federal government encourages many kinds of behavior
it should also encourage service preferably by all classes and all ages
its encouragement should strengthen and not undercut the strong tradition of volunteering in the <unk> should build on the service programs already in existence and should honor local convictions about which tasks most need doing
n good programs are not cheap
enthusiasts assume that national service would get important work done cheaply forest fires fought housing rehabilitated students tutored day - care centers staffed
there is important work n to be done and existing service and conservation corps have shown that even youths who start with few skills can do much of it well but not cheaply
good service programs require recruitment screening training and supervision all of high quality
they involve stipends to participants
full - time residential programs also require housing and full - time supervision they are particularly expensive more per participant than a year at <unk> or <unk>
<unk> - residential programs are cheaper but good ones still come to some <unk> a year
are they worth that
evaluations suggest that good ones are especially so if the effects on participants are counted
but the calculations are challengeable
n <unk> youth are a special concern
are such expenditures worthwhile then
yes if targeted
people of all ages and all classes should be encouraged to serve but there are many ways for middle - class kids and their elders to serve at little public cost
they can volunteer at any of thousands of non - profit institutions or participate in service programs required by high schools or encouraged by colleges or employers
underclass youth do n't have those opportunities
they are not enrolled in high school or college
they are unlikely to be employed
and they have grown up in unprecedentedly grim circumstances among family structures breaking down surrounded by self - destructive behaviors and bleak prospects
but many of them can be quite profoundly reoriented by productive and disciplined service
some wo n't accept the discipline others drop out for other reasons
but some whom nothing else is reaching are transformed
learning skills producing something cooperatively feeling useful they are no longer dependent others now depend on them
even if it is cheaper to build playgrounds or paint apartments or plant dune - grass with paid professionals the effects on the young people providing those services alter the calculation
strictly speaking these youth are not performing service
they are giving up no income deferring no careers incurring no risk
but they believe themselves to be serving and they begin to respect themselves and others to take control of their lives to think of the future
that is a service to the nation
it is what federal support should try hardest to achieve
<unk> <unk> a <unk> administration budget official heads his own <unk> - based strategic planning firm
he is a co - author of <unk> <unk> what would it mean
<unk> <unk> <unk>
government officials here and in other countries laid plans through the weekend to head off a <unk> market meltdown but went out of their way to keep their moves quiet
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was on the telephones making it clear to officials in the <unk> and abroad that the <unk> was prepared to inject massive amounts of money into the banking system as it did in <unk> n if the action were needed to prevent a financial crisis
and at the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> talked with friends and associates on <unk> <unk> while <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> carefully analyzed data on the <unk> market plunge
but the officials feared that any public announcements would only increase market jitters
in addition officials at the <unk> and in the <unk> administration decided that avoiding overt actions and statements over the weekend would give them more strength and flexibility should <unk> market drop turn into this morning rout
the disadvantage at this point is that anything n you do that looks like you are doing too much tends to reinforce a sense of crisis said one government official insisting on anonymity
the <unk> efforts at secrecy were partly foiled <unk> morning when both the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> carried stories quoting a senior <unk> official saying n the central bank was prepared to pour cash into the banking system <unk> morning
<unk> <unk> <unk> was surprised by both stories according to knowledgeable sources and insisted <unk> he had n't authorized any public comment
nevertheless <unk> officials acknowledged n the stories were reasonably accurate portrayals of the central bank game plan
it is prepared to assume the same role <unk> it played in <unk> n providing money to the markets if necessary to keep the financial system afloat
the <unk> provides money to the banking system by buying government securities from financial institutions
the reticence of federal officials was evident in the appearance <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> this week
<unk> of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and the chairman of the <unk> and others have been in close contact
i sure n they do what right what prudent what sensible he said
when it was suggested n his comment was a non - answer <unk> <unk> replied it is a non - answer
but in this context that the smart thing n to do
at the <unk> <unk> <unk> issued a statement minimizing the stock market drop
today stock market decline does n't signal any fundamental change in the condition of the economy he said
the economy remains well - balanced and the outlook is for continued moderate growth
but administration officials conceded that <unk> drop carried the chance of further declines this week
one possibility is that this is a surgical setback reasonably limited in its breadth and not a major problem said one senior administration official who also asked that he not be named
the other is that we see another major disaster like two years ago
i think n that less likely
nevertheless <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> were in their offices <unk> evening monitoring events as they unfolded in markets around the world
the action was expected to begin with the opening of the <unk> <unk> foreign exchange markets at n p.m. <unk> when stocks there plunged and to continue as the trading day began later in the evening in <unk> and through early this morning in <unk>
both the <unk> and the <unk> planned to keep market rooms operating throughout the night to monitor the developments
in <unk> share prices dropped sharply by <unk> in early <unk> morning trading
after the initial slide the market appeared to be turning around but by early afternoon was headed lower
in the <unk> administration the lead is being taken by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
the three men worked together on the so - called <unk> <unk> headed by <unk> <unk> which was established after the <unk> crash to examine the market collapse
as a result they have extensive knowledge in financial markets and financial market crises
<unk> <unk> was at the <unk> <unk> <unk> afternoon when the stock market decline began
he was quickly on the phone with <unk> <unk> who in turn was talking with the chairmen of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> exchanges
later <unk> <unk> phoned <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and numerous contacts in <unk> <unk> and overseas
aides say n he continued to work the phones through the weekend
administration officials say n <unk> <unk> was briefed throughout <unk> afternoon and evening even after leaving for <unk> <unk>
he had frequent telephone consultations with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> chairman of the counsel of economic advisers
government officials tried throughout the weekend to render a business - as-usual appearance in order to avoid any sense of panic
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for instance was at a meeting of the <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> when the stock market fell and remained there through the following day
and as of last night <unk> <unk> <unk> had n't canceled his plans to address the <unk> bankers <unk> convention in <unk> at <unk> a.m. this morning
ironically <unk> <unk> was scheduled to address the same convention in <unk> on <unk> n <unk>
he flew to <unk> on <unk> n when the market plummeted n points but then turned around the next morning and returned to <unk> without delivering his speech

put down that phone
walk around the room take two deep breaths
resist the urge to call your broker and sell all your stocks
that the advice of most investment professionals after <unk> <unk> drop in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
no one can say for sure what will happen today
and investment pros are divided on whether stocks will perform well or badly in the next six months
but they nearly unanimous on one point do n't sell into a panic
investors who sold everything after the crash of <unk> lived to regret it
even after <unk> plunge the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was n above where it landed on <unk> n two years ago
<unk> selling also was unwise during other big declines in the past
the crash of <unk> was followed by a substantial recovery before the great <unk> and awful bear market of the <unk> began
the <unk> massacres of <unk> and n were scary but did n't lead to severe or sustained downturns
indeed some pros see <unk> plunge plus any further damage that might occur early this week as a chance for bargain hunting
there has been a lot of emotional selling that presents a nice buying opportunity if you got the cash says <unk> <unk> <unk> chief investment officer of <unk> - based <unk> <unk> services <unk>
but most advisers think n the immediate course for individual investors should be to stand pat
when you see a runaway train says <unk> <unk> partner in the <unk> <unk> investment advisory firm <unk> <unk> you wait for the train to stop
even for people who expect a bear market in coming months and a sizable number of money managers and market pundits do the advice is <unk> for the market to bounce back and sell shares gradually during rallies
the best thing n individual investors can do is just sit tight says <unk> <unk> <unk> executive vice president and head of investment counseling at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> - based investment counseling firm that manages about n billion
on the one hand <unk> <unk> says <unk> it would be misguided to sell into a classic panic
on the other hand it not necessarily a good time <unk> to jump in and buy
this is all emotion right now and when emotion starts to run it can run further than anyone anticipates he said
so it more prudent to wait and see how things stabilize
<unk> <unk> professor of finance at <unk> <unk> and head of the market information firm <unk> associates <unk> says my real advice would be to just ride through it
generally it is n't wise to be in and out of the stock market
<unk> <unk> thinks that this week is going to be a roller - coaster week
but he also thinks n it is a good week n to consider buying
<unk> <unk> former president of the <unk> <unk> chapter of the <unk> <unk> of investors <unk> an organization of investment clubs and individual investors says n his fellow club members did n't sell in the crash of <unk> and see no reason n to sell now
we dedicated long - term investors not traders he says
we understand panics and euphoria
and we hope to take advantage of panics and buy stocks when they plunge
one camp of investment pros sees what happened <unk> as an opportunity
over the next days and weeks they say n investors should look for stocks n to buy
<unk> action was an old - fashioned panic says <unk> <unk> <unk> director of technical market analysis for <unk> <unk> sons in <unk> <unk>
stocks were being thrown out of windows at any price
his advice you ought to be there with a basket catching them
<unk> <unk> portfolio manager for the <unk> - based <unk> <unk> which has one of the industry better track records started his buying during <unk> plunge
stocks such as <unk> foods <unk> <unk> - <unk> stores <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> became such bargains that he could n't resist them he says n
and <unk> <unk> expects to pick up more shares today
it will be chaotic at first but i would not be buying if i thought n we were headed for real trouble he says
he argues that stocks are reasonably valued now and that interest rates are lower now than in the fall of n
<unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> suggests that any buying should concentrate in stocks that have lagged the market on the up side or stocks that have been beaten down a lot more than the market in this correction
his firm favors selected computer drug and pollution - control stocks
other investment pros are more pessimistic
they say n investors should sell stocks but not necessarily right away
many of them stress that the selling can be orderly gradual and done when stock prices are rallying
on <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> money manager used futures contracts in his personal account to place a bet that the broad market averages would decline
he thinks <unk> the underlying inflation rate is around <unk> to <unk> far higher than most people suppose
in the pension accounts n he manages <unk> <unk> has raised cash positions and invested in gold and natural gas stocks partly as an inflation hedge
he thinks n government officials are terrified to let a recession start when government corporate and personal debt levels are so high
so he thinks n the government will err on the side of rekindled inflation
as a result <unk> <unk> says n i think n the ball game over and investors are about to face a bear market
<unk> <unk> <unk> vice president at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> recommends <unk> securities of up to five years maturity
he says n the <unk> n employment report showing slower economic growth and a severe weakening in the manufacturing sector is a warning sign to investors
one strategy for investors who want to stay in but hedge their bets is to buy put options either on the individual stocks n they own or on a broad market index
a put option gives its holder the right but not the obligation to sell a stock or stock index for a specified price the strike price until the option expires
whether this insurance is worthwhile depends on the cost of an option
the cost or premium tends to get fat in times of crisis
thus buying puts after a big market slide can be an expensive way n to hedge against risk
the prices of puts generally did n't soar <unk>
for example the premium as a percentage of the stock price for certain puts on <unk> <unk> <unk> moved up from n at <unk> close to only n at <unk> close even though the shares dropped more than <unk>
but put - option prices may zoom when trading resumes today
it hard to generalize about a reasonable price for puts
but investors should keep in mind before paying too much that the average annual return for stock holdings long - term is <unk> to <unk> a year a return of <unk> is considered praiseworthy
paying say n for insurance against losses takes a deep bite out of the return
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> contributed to this article
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> it sold n million of common stock to its employees at <unk> a share giving them a total stake of more than <unk> in the commercial real estate brokerage firm
the firm which was acquired in <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk> in a management - led buy - out had planned to sell up to n million of stock or a <unk> stake in the company to its n employees
though the offering did n't sell out <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman and chief executive officer said we pretty proud of the employees response
he noted that unlike an employee stock ownership plan where a company usually borrows money from third party lenders to buy stock that it sets aside to award employees over time here employees had to fork out their own cash for the stock
they came up with their own money instead of borrowed money <unk> <unk> said
it totally different
he said <unk> the offering was designed to create long - term incentives for employees
we in a service business and in that context it vital to have your employees involved in the ownership so they have a stake in the success
the brokerage firm wo n't pay a dividend on the stock
employees have the right to trade stock among themselves and the company will establish an internal clearing house for these transactions
they may also eventually sell the shares to third parties but the outside investors who own the remaining n of <unk> <unk> have the right to first refusal
those outside investors in <unk> <unk> include <unk> <unk> a closely held <unk> <unk> merchant banking firm whose co - chairman is <unk> <unk> former secretary of defense <unk> <unk> <unk> senior adviser to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the financial services unit of <unk> <unk> <unk> bankers <unk> <unk> a unit of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and a group of japanese investors represented by the investment banking unit of <unk> - based <unk> <unk>
bankers <unk> and <unk> financed the n million acquisition from <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> also named three outside director nominees for its <unk> member board
the nominees are <unk> <unk> chief financial officer of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> chief executive officer of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> former commissioner of baseball and now a private investor
the first major event this morning in <unk> stock and futures trading may be a pause at the <unk> <unk> <unk>
under a reform arising from the <unk> crash trading in the <unk> stock - index futures will break for n minutes if the contract opens and stays five points from <unk> close a move equal to n points on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the aim of the interruption would be to ease the opening of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which would be hammered by such a volatile move on the <unk>
that early - morning breather is just one of a number of safeguards adopted after the <unk> crash
the <unk> <unk> also added computer capacity to handle huge surges in trading volume
several of those post - crash changes kicked in during <unk> one - hour collapse and worked as expected even though they did n't prevent a stunning plunge
but the major circuit breakers have yet to be evaluated
a deeper market plunge today could give them their first test
a further slide also would resurrect debate over a host of other more sweeping changes proposed but not implemented after the last crash
most notably several of the regulatory steps recommended by the <unk> <unk> <unk> which analyzed the <unk> crash would be revived especially because that group chairman is now the <unk> secretary
the most controversial of the <unk> recommendations involved establishing a single overarching regulator to handle crucial cross - market questions such as setting consistent margin requirements for the stock and futures markets
but for the moment attention focuses on the reforms that were put into place and market regulators and participants said <unk> the circuit breakers worked as intended
<unk> <unk> and <unk> officials expressed satisfaction with the results of two limits imposed on of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> contract as well as hot - line communications among exchanges
those pauses from n p.m. to n p.m. <unk> and from <unk> p.m. until the close of trading a half - hour later forced traders to buy and sell contracts at prices at or higher than their frozen levels
during the first halt after the <unk> index had fallen n points the <unk> <unk> <unk> computer program automatically was triggered
that system is designed to separate computer - generated program trades from all other trades to help exchange officials resolve order imbalances in individual stocks
one <unk> broker compared the action in the <unk> pit during the two freezes to a fire at a well - drilled school
you do n't want the fire but you know what to do said <unk> <unk> an independent floor broker and a <unk> governor
there was no panic
the system worked the way n we devised it to work
after reopening for about <unk> minutes the <unk> index tumbled to its <unk> limit and the second freeze went into effect
traders then spent the last half - hour watching to see if the <unk> would drop n points <unk> <unk> added <unk> referring to the level at which the stock market itself would have closed for an hour
one observer estimated that <unk> to n of the <unk> traders were just standing around watching
but the n circuit breaker never had to kick in and freezes on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> also were n't triggered
the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> are the two major indexes used by program traders to run their computerized trading strategies
the programs are considered by many to be a major cause of the <unk> crash
the process of post - crash reforms began with calls <unk> to remake the markets and wound up a year later with a series of rather technical adjustments
in <unk> <unk> just after the market drop <unk> was awash in talk of sweeping changes in the way n the financial markets are structured and regulated
over the next year that grand agenda was whittled down to a series of steps n to soften big stock drops by interrupting trading to give market players time n to pause and reconsider positions
in addition limits were placed on computer - driven trading and steps were taken to better link the stock and futures markets
few changes were made in the way n the markets are regulated
at the outset the prime target was program trading which was much discussed but little understood on <unk> <unk>
there were also calls n to strip the stock markets of derivative products such as stock - index futures and options which <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for example likened to barnacles attached to the basic market
and there was much criticism of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> system of having stock trades flow through specialists or market makers
when the <unk> <unk> <unk> powerful analysis of the crash was released in <unk> <unk> it immediately reshaped the reformers agenda
arguing that the separate financial marketplaces acted as one and concluding that the crash had raised the possibility of a full - scale financial system breakdown the presidential task force called for establishing a super - regulator to oversee the markets to make margins consistent across markets to unify clearing systems and to install circuit breakers
only the last of those recommendations ever was implemented
the <unk> <unk> <unk> held the <unk> recommendations at arm length and named a second panel the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> markets to review its analysis and those of other crash studies
in <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> made up of representatives from the <unk> <unk> the <unk> the securities and <unk> <unk> and the <unk> futures <unk> <unk> finally endorsed only circuit breakers
after several more months of arguments among various stock exchanges and futures markets circuit breakers were set in place with the most notable suspending trading after <unk> and <unk> point drops in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
privately some free marketeers dismissed such mechanisms as sops to interventionists
after all this free - market argument went n the <unk> only dropped more than <unk> points once this century
circuit breakers set to soften big drops
if <unk> futures fall n points at opening contract trading pauses for n minutes
if <unk> <unk> fall <unk> points at opening contract trading pauses for n minutes
if <unk> futures fall <unk> points equivalent to about n points on <unk> trading is frozen for half hour to that price or higher
on <unk> program trades are diverted into a separate computer file to determine buy and sell orders
if <unk> futures fall n points trading is restricted for an hour to that price or higher
if <unk> <unk> fall <unk> points trading on the <unk> <unk> halts for an hour
<unk> and <unk> contracts also halt
if <unk> drops <unk> points <unk> <unk> halts trading for two hours
trading in <unk> and <unk> futures also halted
<unk> <unk> <unk> recommendations <unk> n

americans used to complain bitterly about being undersold by look - alike products from <unk>
now <unk> whose innovative premium - priced products are among the most admired in consumer electronics is bitterly complaining about a little <unk> firm with a cheap look - alike produced in <unk>
the gist of this is that <unk> knocked off the <unk> line and <unk> wants to stop it says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> attorney who previously guarded <unk> <unk>
<unk> itself declines to comment
if <unk> wins <unk> <unk> says its little rival will have to try to sell the products overseas
at worst he adds they have to grind them all up and throw them away
<unk> <unk> denies the suit charges and says <unk> his only mistake was taking on <unk> in the marketplace

though hoping to settle the case <unk> vows to fight on if necessary
but the battle is more than <unk> bargained for
i had no idea n i was getting in so deep says <unk> <unk> who founded <unk> in <unk>
<unk> <unk> had sold <unk> <unk> a <unk> electronics maker and retired only to find n he was bored
with <unk> he began selling toys and electronics made mostly in <unk> <unk> beginning with <unk> <unk> radios
the company has grown to about <unk> employees from four initially <unk> <unk> says
<unk> has been profitable since <unk> adds n the official who shares his office with numerous teddy bears all samples from his line of plush toys
like many others <unk> <unk> took notice in <unk> when <unk> in a classic example of market segmentation changed the plastic skin and buttons on the famous <unk> line of portable audio equipment and created the my first <unk> line for children
the brightly colored new products looked more like toys than the adult models
in court papers <unk> says <unk> it has spent more than n million to promote the line with resulting sales of over a million units
<unk> found a new market niche but <unk> <unk> figured that its prices left plenty of room for a lower - priced competitor
his products are n't exact copies of <unk> but strongly resemble them in size shape and especially color
<unk> uses mostly red and blue with traces of yellow and so does <unk> on the theory that kids prefer these colors
to be successful a product can be any color whatsoever as long as it is fire - engine red says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> attorney
by last winter <unk> was showing prototypes at toy fairs in <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> noticed
indeed concerned that <unk> sales personnel were threatening legal action or other retaliation such as withholding desirable <unk> products against <unk> customers <unk> <unk> fired off a letter to <unk> in <unk>
he himself threatened to take the matter to the <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk>
but <unk> has n't pursued those charges which were without merit according to <unk> <unk> the <unk> attorney
recalls <unk> <unk> our purpose was to influence them to leave us alone
we never intended taking on <unk> we do n't have the resources
<unk> answered the empty threat with its real suit
off and on since then the companies have skirmished in court
and <unk> in a news release says once competitive <unk> now resorts to strong - arm tactics in american courtrooms to carve out and protect niche markets
<unk> lawyer insists that the company tactics including the use of a private detective posing as a buyer are routine in such matters
he also insists that <unk> no less than others has a legal right to protect its trade dress in this case mostly the colors that it claims <unk> make my first <unk> products distinctive
<unk> claims <unk> it began using the same colors on electronic goods for children long before <unk> entered the children market
whatever its merits <unk> aggressive defense is debilitating for <unk>
it also costly
<unk> <unk> says <unk> he has paid more than <unk> in legal fees so far

the market for <unk> billion of high - risk junk bonds battered by a succession of defaults and huge price declines this year practically vanished <unk>
trading ground to a halt as investors rushed to sell bonds only to find themselves deserted by potential buyers
stunned they watched brokerage houses mark down price quotations on their junk holdings while being able to execute very few actual trades
the junk bond market is in a state of gridlock now there are no bids only offers says independent investor <unk> <unk> <unk> who manages nearly n billion and who recently decided to buy distressed securities for a new fund
this calamity is far from over he says n
junk collapse helped stoke the panicky selling of stocks that produced the deepest one - day dive in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> since the <unk> <unk> <unk> crash
simultaneously it also helped trigger this year biggest rally in the <unk> government bond market as investors rushed to move capital into the highest - quality securities n they could find
but an eerie silence pervaded the junk market <unk> as prices tumbled on hundreds of high - yield bonds despite no active trading says <unk> <unk> an economist at <unk> investors <unk> <unk>
for example the price of <unk> <unk> n million of <unk> <unk> bonds due n sold less than two years ago by <unk> <unk> <unk> plummeted <unk> to just n cents on the dollar
but not even <unk> would make a market in the securities of <unk> the owner of the nationwide chain of <unk> convenience stores that is strapped for cash
<unk> officials declined to comment
junk bonds which mushroomed from less than n billion at the start of this decade have been declining for months as issuer after issuer sank beneath the weight of hefty interest payments
the shaky market received its biggest jolt last month from <unk> <unk> which created its <unk> retailing empire with junk financing
<unk> developed a cash squeeze that caused it to be tardy on some interest payments and to put its prestigious <unk> department - store chain up for sale
now dozens of corporations including <unk> <unk> <unk> services and <unk> <unk> that are counting on at least n billion of scheduled new junk financings to keep their highly leveraged takeovers and buy - outs afloat may never get the money
the music has stopped playing says <unk> <unk> a principal in the investment firm of <unk> <unk>
you either got a chair or you do n't
in <unk> aftermath says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a director of high - yield finance at <unk> <unk> <unk> much of the <unk> billion forward calendar could be deferred depending on the hysteria
in <unk> <unk> <unk> withdrew a n million junk offering of <unk> <unk> bonds because potential buyers were very skittish
the outlook looks shaky because we still waiting for mutual funds in particular to dump some of their junk bond holdings to pay off redemptions by individual investors says <unk> <unk> <unk> senior vice president at <unk> <unk> <unk> an investment arm of <unk> <unk> services
indeed a <unk> index that tracks the net asset values of <unk> high - yield mutual funds declined for the n consecutive day <unk>
in a stark contrast the benchmark <unk> <unk> bond climbed more than <unk> <unk> points or about n for each <unk> face amount to <unk> <unk> its biggest gain of the year
the bond yield dropped to <unk> the lowest since <unk> <unk> <unk> according to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the yield on three - month <unk> bills considered the safest of all investments plummeted about n percentage point to n the largest one - day decline since <unk>
the main catalyst for government bond market rally was the <unk> drop in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
when you get panic in one market you get flight to quality in the other said <unk> <unk> money market economist at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
nevertheless the problems of the junk market could prompt the <unk> <unk> to ease credit in the months ahead
this marks a significant shift in the interest rate outlook says <unk> <unk> director of money market research at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
any sustained credit - easing could be a lift for junk bonds as well as other securities
<unk> <unk> a partner and portfolio manager at <unk> <unk> <unk> which manages n billion of high - yield bonds says <unk> he does n't think n there is any fundamental economic rationale for the junk bond rout
it was herd instinct
he adds the junk market has witnessed some trouble and now some people think that if the equity market gets creamed that means n the economy will be terrible and that bad for junk
i do n't believe <unk> that the case but i believe that people are running scared
there is a flight to quality and the quality is not in equities and not in junk it in treasurys
even as trading in high - yield issues dried up over the past month corporations sold more than <unk> billion of new junk bonds
for example a recent n million offering of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> bonds sold by <unk> <unk> was three times oversubscribed
a n million offering of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> high - yield securities sold last week by <unk> was increased n million because of strong demand
<unk> <unk> estimates that in <unk> and <unk> alone junk bond investors will receive n billion of coupon interest payments
that a clear indication that there is and will be an undercurrent of basic business going on says <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
i do n't know how people can say n the junk bond market disappeared when there were n billion of orders for n million of junk bonds sold last week by <unk> says <unk> <unk> co - head of merchant banking at <unk> <unk> <unk>
when the rally comes insurance companies will be leading it because they have billions n to invest and invest they will
there is plenty of money available from people who want to buy well - structured deals it the stuff that financed on a shoestring that people are wary of
but such highly leveraged transactions seemed to have multiplied this year casting a pall over much of the junk market
<unk> <unk> director of fixed - income research at <unk> <unk> <unk> says n the quality of junk issues has been getting poorer contributing to the slide in prices
last year we probably bought one out of every three new deals he says
this year at best it in one in every five or six
and our credit standards have n't changed one iota
however <unk> <unk> said <unk> the slide in junk is creating one hell of a buying opportunity for selective buyers
for the moment investors seem more preoccupied with the bad junk than the good junk
the market has been weak since the announcement of the <unk> cash squeeze and the company subsequent bailout by <unk> <unk> says <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
that really affected the market in that people started to ask what else is in trouble
well before <unk> though there were signs that the junk market was stumbling through one of its worst years ever
despite the relatively strong economy junk bond prices did nothing except go down hammered by a seemingly endless trail of bad news
in <unk> two months before it would default on interest payments covering some of its <unk> billion of speculative debt securities <unk> <unk> - based <unk> <unk> <unk> said n it ran out of borrowed money
in <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> - based real estate and financial services company with about <unk> billion of junk bonds voluntarily filed for protection under <unk> bankruptcy law
by the end of <unk> the difference in yield between an index of junk bonds and seven - year <unk> notes widened to more than n percentage points
in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which sold more than n million of junk bonds suspended interest payments
in <unk> just as the cash squeeze hit <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> defaulted on n million of notes and appeared unlikely to pay interest on a total of n billion of debt securities
meantime regulators are becoming increasingly worried as the rush to leverage shows no signs of abating
<unk> says n the frequency of corporate credit downgrades is the highest this year since <unk>
in addition there are six times as many troubled banks as there were in the recession of <unk> according to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the era of the <unk> is about compound interest and the reaching for it says <unk> <unk> editor of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> an early critic of the junk bond market
what we begun to see is the damage to businesses of paying exorbitant compound interest
businesses were borrowing at interest rates higher than their own earnings
what we seeing now is the wrenching readjustment of asset values to a future when speculative - grade debt will be hard to obtain rather than easy
<unk> <unk>
prices of <unk> bonds surged in the biggest rally of the year as investors fled a plummeting stock market
the benchmark <unk> <unk> bond was quoted n p.m. <unk> at <unk> <unk> compared with n n <unk> up <unk> <unk> points
the yield on the benchmark fell to <unk> the lowest since <unk> <unk> <unk> according to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the flight to quality began late in the day and followed a precipitous fall in the stock market
treasurys opened lower reacting negatively to news that the producer price index a measure of inflation on the wholesale level accelerated in <unk>
bond prices barely budged until midday
many bond market participants will be closely eying the action of the <unk> <unk> which might repeat its <unk> n injection of huge amounts of liquidity to buoy the financial markets and keep the economy from slowing into a recession
prices of municipals investment - grade corporates and mortgage - backed bonds also rose but lagged behind their <unk> counterparts
mortgage securities rose in hectic trading with most of the activity concentrated in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> coupon securities the most liquid mortgage issue
the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> issue ended at <unk> <unk> up n point on the day to yield about <unk> to a n average life assumption
investment - grade corporate bonds were up about <unk> to n point
but the yield spread between lower - quality investment - grade issues and higher - quality bonds widened
and the yields on telephone and utility issues rose relative to other investment - grade bonds in anticipation of this week n billion bond offering by the <unk> <unk> <unk>
despite rumors that the <unk> long - awaited offering would be postponed because of the debacle in the equity markets sources in the underwriting syndicate said <unk> they expect <unk> the issue will be priced as scheduled
one of the sources said n the smaller portions of n million each of five - year and n bonds have already been substantially oversubscribed
municipal bonds rose as much as <unk> point
<unk> <unk> contributed to this article
<unk> <unk> plunge in stocks does not come atop the climate of anxiety that dominated financial markets just prior to their n <unk> crash and mechanisms have been put in place to keep markets more orderly
still the lesson is about the same on <unk> the <unk> the market was spooked by <unk>
the consensus along the street seems to be that the plunge was triggered by the financing problems of the <unk> takeover and it certainly true n the rout began immediately after the <unk> trading halt
still the consensus seems almost as wide that one faltering bid is no reason n to write down the value of all <unk> business
this observation leads us to another piece of news moving on the <unk> <unk> ticker shortly before the downturn the success of <unk> democrats in stalling the capital gains tax cut
the real value of all shares after all is directly impacted by the tax on any profits all the more so given the limits on deductions for losses that show n gains are not ordinary income
and market expectations clearly have been raised by the capital gains victory in the <unk> last month
an hour before <unk> plunge that provision was stripped from the tax bill leaving it with <unk> billion in tax increases without a capital gains cut
there is a great deal n to be said to be sure for stripping the garbage out of the reconciliation bill
it would be a good thing if <unk> started to decide issues one - by-one on their individual merits without trickery
for one thing no one doubts that the capital gains cut would pass on an up - or-down vote
since <unk> leaders have so far fogged it up with procedural smokescreens promises of a cleaner bill are suspect
especially so since <unk> <unk> has been weakened by the <unk> fiasco
to the extent that the <unk> troubles contributed to the plunge they are another instance of <unk> sticky fingers
as the best opportunities for corporate restructurings are exhausted of course at some point the market will start to reject them
but the airlines are scarcely a clear case given anti - takeover mischief by <unk> of <unk> <unk> who professes to believe <unk> safety will be compromised if <unk> and <unk> airways own interests in companies that fly airplanes
worse <unk> has started to jump on the <unk> bandwagon
<unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> who chairs the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> aviation subcommittee has put an anti - airline takeover bill on supersonic speed so that it would be passed in time to affect the american and <unk> <unk> <unk> bids
it would give <unk> <unk> up to <unk> days to review any bid for n or more of the voting stock of any <unk> carrier with revenues of <unk> billion or more
so the <unk> deal has problems and the market loses <unk> points
congratulations <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
in the <unk> crash remember the market was shaken by a <unk> <unk> proposal to tax takeovers out of existance
even more important in our view was the <unk> threat to thrash the dollar
the <unk> is doing the same thing today thankfully the dollar is not under <unk> pressure
also traders are in better shape today than in <unk> to survive selling binges
they are better capitalized
they are in less danger of losing liquidity simply because of tape lags and clearing and settlement delays
the <unk> promises any needed liquidity
the <unk> <unk> liaison with the <unk> <unk> of <unk> has improved it will be interesting to learn if circuit breakers prove to be a good idea
in any event some traders see stocks as underpriced today unlike n
there is nothing wrong with the market that ca n't be cured by a little coherence and common sense in <unk>
but on the bearish side that may be too much <unk> to expect
<unk> <unk> <unk> posted a third - quarter loss of n million after joining other big banks in further adding to its reserves for losses on foreign loans
the parent company of <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> with n billion in assets said n it set aside n million to absorb losses on loans and investments in financially troubled countries
the addition on top of two big n additions to foreign - loan reserves brings the reserve to a level equaling n of medium - term and long - term loans outstanding to troubled nations
<unk> <unk> since <unk> has reduced its loans to such nations to n billion from n billion
despite this loss <unk> <unk> said n it does n't need to sell stock to raise capital
during the quarter the company realized a pretax gain of n million from the sale of its <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> unit
combined foreign exchange and bond trading profits dipped n against last year third quarter to n million from n million
gains from <unk> <unk> venture capital unit a big leveraged buy - out investor rose <unk> to n million from n million a year ago
interest income and most fee income was strong
<unk> second bout of general elections this year is slated for <unk> n
for those hoping to see a modicum of political normalcy restored in view of <unk> eight - year misadventure under autocratic pseudosocialism and subsequent three - month hitch with a conservative - communist coalition government there is but one bright sign the scandals still encircling former <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and his fallen socialist government are like flies buzzing around a rotting carcass
in the mid - <unk> round of voting greeks gave no clear mandate to any single political party
the ad interim coalition government that emerged from post - electoral hagglings was in essence little more than the ill - conceived offspring of ideological miscegenation on one side the center - right <unk> <unk> <unk> headed by <unk> <unk>
on the other the so - called <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> a quaint and rather deceptive title for a merger of the pro - <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> and its <unk> - <unk> cousin the <unk> <unk>
the unifying bond for this left - right mismatch was plain <unk> <unk> <unk> party as common political enemy
the ostensible goal was a mop - up of government corruption purportedly at all levels but the main marks were <unk> <unk> and his closest associates
in point of fact this catharsis was overdue by decades
when reduced to buzzword status in <unk> parte pledges however the notion transmogrified into a promised assault with targets primarily for political gains not justice
with regard to <unk> long - bubbling bank - looting scandal <unk> <unk> principal accuser remains <unk> <unk> former owner of the <unk> of <unk> and self - confessed embezzler now residing in a jail cell in <unk> <unk> from where he is fighting extradition proceedings that would return him to <unk>
<unk> <unk> credibility is at best problematic
he has ample motive to shift the blame and his testimony has also been found less than forthright on numerous points
nevertheless the <unk> <unk> and communist parties herald his assertions as proof of <unk> complicity
among unanswered questions are whether <unk> <unk> received n million of stolen <unk> of <unk> funds and an additional n in bribes as contended whether the prime minister ordered state agencies to deposit some n million in <unk> <unk> bank and then skim off the interest and what <unk> cut was from the <unk> million <unk> <unk> <unk> pinched
two former ministers were so heavily implicated in the <unk> affair that <unk> members of <unk> voted to refer them to the special court
but eluding parliamentary probe was the case of millions of drachmas <unk> <unk> <unk> funneled into <unk> <unk> coffers
in the end the investigation produced only circumstantial evidence and indications that point to <unk> not clinching proof
on another issue greeks were told how their national intelligence agency the <unk> regularly monitored the telephone conversations of prominent figures including key opposition politicians journalists and <unk> cabinet members
despite convincing arguments it was never established that <unk> <unk> personally ordered or directed the wiretaps
the central weakness of the scandals debates was pointed up especially well when discussions focused on arms deals and kickbacks
the coalition government tried to show that <unk> ministers had received hefty sums for oking the purchase of <unk> fighting <unk> and <unk> <unk> combat aircraft produced by the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> respectively
naturally neither <unk> <unk> nor <unk> could be expected to hamper its prospective future dealings by making disclosures of sums paid or not to various greek officials for services rendered
so it seems that <unk> <unk> and his communist chums may have unwittingly served <unk> <unk> a moral victory on a platter <unk> whether guilty or not can now traipse the countryside condemning the whole affair as a witch hunt at <unk> <unk> expense
but while verbal high jinks alone wo n't help <unk> regain power <unk> <unk> should never be underestimated
first came his predictable fusillade he charged <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> had sold out its leftist tenets by collaborating in a right - wing plot aimed at ousting <unk> and thwarting the course of socialism in <unk>
then to buttress his credibility with the left he enticed some smaller leftist parties to stand for election under the <unk> banner
next he continued to court the communists many of whom feel betrayed by the left - right coalition birth by bringing into <unk> a well - respected <unk> <unk> candidate
for balance and in hopes of gaining some disaffected centrist votes he managed to attract a former <unk> <unk> <unk> representative and known political enemy of <unk> <unk>
thus <unk> heads for the polls not only with diminished scandal - stench but also with seals of approval from representatives of its harshest accusers
crucial as these elections are for <unk> pressing issues of state are getting lost in the shuffle
the country future <unk> participation remains unsure for instance
<unk> also must revamp major pieces of legislation in preparation for the n targets of heightened <unk> <unk> cooperation
<unk> bilateral relations with the <unk> need attention soon as well
for one the current accord concerning <unk> military bases in <unk> lapses in <unk> <unk>
negotiations for a new agreement were frozen before the <unk> elections but the clock is running
another matter of concern is the extradition of <unk> <unk> a palestinian terrorist who is wanted in the <unk> for the <unk> bombing of a <unk> <unk> <unk> flight
the <unk> courts have decided in favor of extradition in the <unk> case but the matter awaits final approval from <unk> next justice minister
the greeks seem barely aware of the importance of the case as a litmus test of whether <unk> will be counted in or out for international efforts to combat terrorism
that <unk> could win the elections outright is improbable the greek press previously eager to palm off <unk> line has turned on <unk> <unk> with a wild - eyed vengeance
yet the possibility of another lash - up government is all too real
if <unk> <unk> becomes the major opposition leader he could hamstring a conservative - led coalition
also he could force new elections early next year by frustrating the procedures for the election of the president of the republic in <unk>
<unk> <unk> has once again glaringly underestimated the opponent and linked its own prospects to negative reaction against <unk> forgetting to tend to either program clarity or the rectification of internal squabbles

a federal appeals court in <unk> <unk> ruled that shareholders ca n't hold corporate officials liable for false sales projections on new products if the news media concurrently revealed substantial information about the product flaws
the ruling stems from a <unk> suit filed by shareholders of <unk> <unk> <unk> claiming that company officials misled investors about the expected success of the <unk> computer introduced in <unk>
lawyers specializing in shareholder suits said <unk> they are concerned that use of the press defense by corporations may become popular as a result of the ruling
according to the suit <unk> officials created public excitement by touting <unk> as an office computer that would revolutionize the workplace and be extremely successful in its first year
the plaintiffs also alleged that prior to the fanfare the company circulated internal memos indicating problems with <unk>
the suit claimed <unk> <unk> stock climbed to a high of <unk> a share on the basis of the company optimistic forecasts
but when the company revealed <unk> poor sales late in <unk> the stock plummeted to a low of <unk> a share according to the suit
the shareholders claimed more than n million in losses
in <unk> the <unk> <unk> district court dismissed the case largely because newspaper reports had sufficiently counterbalanced the company statements by alerting consumers to <unk> problems
late last month the appeals court agreed that most of the case should be dismissed
however it gave the shareholders the right to pursue a small portion of their claim that pertains to <unk> disk drive known as <unk>
the court ruled that the news media did n't reveal <unk> problems at the time
lawyers are worried about the ruling implication in other shareholder suits but pointed out that the court stressed that the ruling should be regarded as very specific to the <unk> case
the court was careful to say that the adverse information appeared in the very same articles and received the same attention as the company statements said <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> lawyer at the firm of <unk> <unk> which was n't involved in the case

canadian <unk> <unk> of <unk> said <unk> it will increase its loan - loss provisions to cover all its loans to lesser developed countries except <unk> resulting in an after - tax charge to <unk> earnings of n million canadian dollars <unk> n million
<unk> <unk> senior vice president and chief accountant said n the bank strong earnings enable it to be the first major canadian bank n to set aside provisions covering all its <unk> <unk> billion in non - mexican <unk> debt
it eliminates the continuing uncertainty with respect to the ultimate value of the loans he said
the bank said <unk> about c$ n million will be added to its existing <unk> and general loss provisions in its fourth quarter ending <unk> n

the bank net income for the nine months ended <unk> <unk> was c$ n million or c$ n a share
<unk> <unk> said <unk> the bank will restructure its <unk> n million of mexican debt of which c$ n million is in mexican notes secured by <unk> government bonds
the bank has a <unk> reserve against the remaining <unk> n million of mexican debt and expects to swap that for other mexican notes supported by <unk> <unk> zero - coupon bonds
<unk> <unk> said <unk> the bank experience with <unk> debt has been painful and this latest move represents the final phase of a program begun seven years ago to reduce its exposure through provisioning debt sales and debt swaps

the carnage among takeover stocks <unk> does n't mean the end of mega - mergers but simply marks the start of a less ambitious game <unk> <unk> big - time deal makers say
suitors from now on are more likely to be expansion - minded companies rather than raiders or debt - happy financiers
and they will be launching lower - priced and perhaps fewer deals now that it tougher to finance them
this is an ominous sign for a stock market that lately has been fueled by takeover speculation and bidding wars for companies that put themselves up for sale
whenever the n merger boom seems to be stalling shock waves ripple through the stock market
the market is overvalued not cheap says <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> money - management firm <unk> <unk>
he recently began increasing his cash position to <unk> of his portfolio
i look at where deals can get done he says and they not getting done at current prices
lenders are growing increasingly nervous about debt - financed takeovers investment bankers say n
you had a week of a deteriorating junk - bond market that ran smack into the news on <unk> about what appeared to be happening to the bank debt market says <unk> <unk> a partner and merger specialist with <unk> <unk> <unk>
trading dried up <unk> in the market for high - yield junk bonds often used to finance takeovers
it was the latest in a series of setbacks for the junk bond market where prices began weakening last month after <unk> hit a cash crunch
and banks appear to be taking an increasingly skeptical view of requests for high - risk takeover loans
the group trying to buy <unk> announced <unk> that it could n't arrange the <unk> billion in bank loans n it needs to buy the parent of <unk> <unk> for <unk> a share
takeover - stock traders today will be scrambling to learn of any <unk> developments and other takeover stocks are likely to trade in sympathy
investment bankers representing the buy - out group and <unk> board spent a frantic weekend trying to hammer out new terms that would be more acceptable to the banks
after <unk> the stock viewed as most vulnerable is <unk> <unk> parent <unk> the target of a n takeover proposal from <unk> <unk> real estate developer <unk> <unk>
trading in <unk> shares was suspended shortly after <unk> p.m. <unk> <unk> and did n't resume
before the halt <unk> last traded at <unk> <unk>
late <unk> night the <unk> office of <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> securities firm traded <unk> shares at prices as low as n
similarly <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> dropped <unk> and <unk> respectively on <unk> and could weaken further
over the weeked however two developments in other deals indicated that commerical banks and <unk> <unk> firms still are willing to commit billions of dollars to finance takeover bids launched by major companies
<unk> <unk> a major mexican glass maker said yesterday that it agreed to buy <unk> <unk> <unk> in a tender offer for <unk> a share sweetened from the original <unk> offer <unk> <unk> launched two months ago
on <unk> <unk> shares fell <unk> <unk> to close at <unk> <unk>
for the broader market the greatest significance of the <unk> - <unk> deal may be that it was put together late <unk> night after the market rout and involves a n million temporary bridge loan from <unk> <unk> <unk> securities and a n million loan from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
moreover to complete the entire <unk> <unk> purchase and refinance existing debt <unk> said n it is highly confident that it will be able to sell n million of junk bonds for <unk> despite the current disarray in the junk bond market
<unk> statement is n't merely an idle boast because those bonds will have to be sold before <unk> bridge loan can be paid back
<unk> <unk> meanwhile said <unk> it expects to arrange n million in bank loans for <unk>
in another takeover battle a spokesman for <unk> <unk> <unk> said yesterday that <unk> has been advised by three commercial banks that they remain highly confident n they can arrange <unk> billion of bank loans for <unk> tender offer for about <unk> of <unk> <unk> notwithstanding recent events
<unk> is offering n a share for n million <unk> shares thereby challenging <unk> proposal to spin off its television properties pay shareholders a <unk> special dividend and combine its cellular - telephone operations with <unk> cellular business
on <unk> <unk> shares were among the few takeover issues that did n't fall much dropping <unk> <unk> or <unk> to close at <unk> <unk>
traders and investment bankers said <unk> <unk> shares were n't hurt much because <unk> is viewed as a well - financed corporate buyer unlikely to be affected by skittishness among bankers or bond buyers
investment bankers interviewed over the weekend see a silver lining for the merger business in the stock - market drop
potential bidders for companies were saying that things were beginning to look expensive says <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>
nothing makes things look cheaper than a n drop in the <unk> <unk> <unk> says
just as there are people waiting to become bargain hunters in the stock market there are people waiting to become bargain hunters in the deal market
investment bankers expect most of those bargain hunters to be well - heeled corporations
in the past corporate buyers were often discouraged from making bids because of competition from <unk> firms which were often prepared to outbid the corporations says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> head of mergers and acquisitions at <unk> <unk> <unk>
now corporate buyers should be willing to re - enter the acquisition market because the competition from junkbond - financed buyers has been reduced
many takeover stocks plunged <unk> as speculators retained their confidence in corporate buyers but fled from the socalled whisper stocks the targets of rumored deals
<unk> pictures <unk> which has agreed to a friendly n bid from <unk> of <unk> fell only n to close at <unk> <unk>
but several stocks long rumored to be ripe for a takeover or restructuring fell n or more
they include <unk> down <unk> <unk> down <unk> <unk> <unk> down <unk> <unk> <unk> off <unk> <unk> down <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> down <unk> and <unk> down <unk>
the market and investment bankers are even less sanguine about companies that have had at least one bid merger agreement or restructuring plan fall through already
given the weakness in both the junk bond market and the stock market traders fear that these transactions may be revised yet again
examples include <unk> whose agreement to be acquired for <unk> a share by <unk> collapsed last month
<unk> shares fell nearly n on <unk> to close at <unk> <unk>
<unk> which first delayed and then shelved a n million junk bond sale that was designed to help finance a restructuring fell <unk> to close at <unk> <unk>
<unk> has said n it hopes to propose a new restructuring plan but has n't indicated when it will do so
shares of <unk> <unk> <unk> which agreed last week to accept a lower price from a buy - out group that includes <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> family of <unk> fell n on <unk> to close at <unk>
the buy - out group is offering n a share for n million american <unk> shares down from its offer in <unk> of <unk> a share for n million shares
but investment bankers say n the market may have oversold some takeover - related stocks
<unk> hotels for example was among the worst - hit issues falling n to close at <unk> down <unk> <unk> on <unk>
<unk> currently is soliciting bids for a sale of part or all of its hotel and casino businesses
people familiar with <unk> said over the weekend that the depth of the sell - off in <unk> shares was unwarranted because none of the likely buyers would be dependent on junk - bond financing
however they conceded that some potential bidders would rely on bank loans and would be hurt if the troubles of the <unk> buy - out group signified a general unwillingness among banks to provide credit for debt - financed takeovers
<unk> officials said n they were n't worried about the drop in the company stock
<unk> <unk> <unk> general counsel said <unk> plans to consider a sale of the company or some of its assets are on track for what has been described previously as a slow and deliberate process
i ca n't believe that any potential buyer for <unk> would be affected by one day trading <unk> <unk> said
but the stock market as a whole bolstered as it is by takeover speculation remains vulnerable to any further pullback by takeover financiers both in the junkbond market and among commercial banks
for debt - ridden suitors the takeover game has been over for some time says n <unk> <unk> money manager <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> who has been keeping <unk> of his portfolio in cash
the market is just waking up to that point
<unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> contributed to this column
of all the one - time expenses incurred by a corporation or professional firm few are larger or longer term than the purchase of real estate or the signing of a commercial lease
to take full advantage of the financial opportunities in this commitment however the corporation or professional firm must do more than negotiate the best purchase price or lease terms
it must also evaluate the real - estate market in the chosen location from a new perspective
specifically it must understand how real - estate markets overreact to shifts in regional economies and then take advantage of these opportunities
when a regional economy catches cold the local real - estate market gets pneumonia
in other words real - estate market indicators such as building permits and leasing activity plummet much further than a local economy in recession
this was seen in the late <unk> in <unk> <unk> and the <unk> in <unk> <unk>
but the reverse is also true when a region economy rebounds from a slowdown these real - estate indicators will rebound far faster than the improving economy
why do local real - estate markets overreact to regional economic cycles
because real - estate purchases and leases are such major long - term commitments that most companies and individuals make these decisions only when confident of future economic stability and growth
<unk> <unk> was written off economically during the early n as the domestic auto industry suffered a serious sales depression and adjustment
<unk> employment dropped by <unk> from its <unk> peak and retail sales were down n
however the real - estate market was hurt even more
for example residential building permits in the trough year of n were off n from the <unk> peak level
once metropolitan <unk> economy rallied in the <unk> real estate rebounded
building permits for example soared a staggering <unk> between <unk> and the peak year of <unk>
where savvy corporations and professional firms are now asking are today opportunities
look no further than metropolitan <unk> and <unk> two of the most depressed overbuilt and potentially undervalued real - estate markets in the nation
of course some observers have touted <unk> and <unk> for the past five years as a counter - cyclical play
but now appears to be the time <unk> to act
<unk> <unk> economy did drop and then flatten in the years after its <unk> peak
in the <unk> employment was down as much as <unk> from the <unk> peak and retail sales were off n
the real - estate market suffered even more severe setbacks
<unk> construction dropped <unk>
the vacancy rate soared more than n in nearly every product category and more than <unk> of office space was vacant
to some observers the empty office buildings of <unk> see - through skyline were indicative of a very troubled economy
as usual the real - estate market had overreacted
actually the region economy retained a firm foundation
<unk> <unk> population has held steady over the past six years
and personal income after slumping in the <unk> has returned to its <unk> level in real dollar terms
today metropolitan <unk> real - estate market is poised for a significant turnaround
more than n jobs were added in <unk> <unk> last year primarily in biotechnology petrochemical processing and the computer industry
this growth puts <unk> in the top five metro areas in the nation last year
and forecasts project a n to n growth rate in jobs over the next few years nearly twice the national average
<unk> is another metropolitan area where the commercial real - estate market has overreacted to the region economic trends although <unk> has not experienced as severe an economic downturn as <unk>
by some measures metropolitan <unk> economy has actually improved in the past four years
its population has continued to increase since <unk> the peak year of the economic cycle
employment is now n higher than in <unk>
buying income in real dollars actually increased <unk> between <unk> and n the most recent year available
the rates of increase however are less than the rapid growth of the boom years and this has resulted in a loss of confidence in the economy
in a self - fulfilling prophecy therefore the region real - estate market all but collapsed in recent years
housing building permits are down more than <unk> from their n peaks
although no one can predict when metropolitan <unk> real - estate market will rebound major public works projects costing several billion dollars are under way or planned such as a new convention center a major beltway encircling the metropolitan area and a new regional airport
when <unk> regional economy begins to grow faster such a recovery could occur as early as next year business and consumer confidence will return and the resulting explosion of real - estate activity will dwarf the general economic rebound
what real - estate strategy should one follow in a metropolitan area whose economic health is not as easy n to determine as <unk> or <unk>
generally overcapacity in commercial real estate is dropping from its <unk> peak even in such economically healthy metropolitan areas as <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
vacancy rates in the <unk> to <unk> range today may easily rise to the low to n range in a couple of years
under these conditions even a flattening out of economic growth catching cold in the healthy metropolitan areas will create significant opportunities for corporations and professional service firms looking for bargains as the realestate industry catches pneumonia
those looking for real - estate bargains in distressed metropolitan areas should lock in leases or buy now those looking in healthy metropolitan areas should take a short - term three - year lease and wait for the bargains ahead
<unk> <unk> is managing partner of a real - estate advisory firm based in <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> it expects its third - quarter net earnings to be between two cents and four cents a share compared with n cents a share a year ago
analysts had been projecting that the company earnings would be between <unk> cents and n cents a share
the year - earlier third - quarter earnings amounted to n million
the company said <unk> a drop in activity in the powerboat industry reduced sales volume at its two marine - related operations
also the company said <unk> its commercial products operation failed to meet forecasts
<unk> a maker of heavy - duty truck and commercial refrigeration equipment said n it expects its fourth - quarter earnings to be more closely in line with usual levels which are between <unk> cents and n cents a share
<unk> <unk> asked both the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to investigate n million in political gifts by <unk> businessman <unk> <unk> to five <unk> senators who interceded with thrift - industry regulators for him
<unk> <unk> is currently the subject of a n billion federal anti - racketeering lawsuit accusing him of bleeding off assets of a <unk> thrift n he controlled <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and driving it into insolvency

<unk> <unk> based this on a statement by <unk> <unk> that was quoted in a <unk> <unk> <unk> story in <unk> one question had to do with whether my financial support in any way influenced several political figures to take up my cause
i want to say in the most forceful way n i can n i certainly hope so
in a highly unusual meeting in <unk> <unk> office in <unk> n the five senators asked federal regulators to ease up on <unk>
according to notes taken by one of the participants at the meeting the regulators said <unk> <unk> was gambling dangerously with depositors federally insured money and was a ticking time bomb
<unk> <unk> had complained that the regulators were being too zealous
the notes show that <unk> <unk> called the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> regulations grossly unfair and that <unk> <unk> insisted that <unk> <unk> thrift was viable and profitable
for the next two years the <unk> <unk> which at the time was the agency responsible for regulating thrifts failed to act even after federal auditors warned in <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> had caused <unk> to become insolvent
<unk> parent company <unk> <unk> <unk> entered bankruptcy - law proceedings this <unk> n and regulators seized the thrift the next day
the newly formed <unk> <unk> <unk> successor to the <unk> <unk> filed suit against <unk> <unk> and several others on <unk> n
<unk> <unk> has filed his own suit alleging that his property was taken illegally
the cost to taxpayers of <unk> collapse has been estimated at as much as n billion
details of the affair have become public gradually over the past two years mostly as a result of reporting by several newspapers
in the midst of his n re - election campaign <unk> <unk> chairman of the <unk> <unk> <unk> returned <unk> in contributions after a <unk> newspaper said that <unk> <unk> had gathered the money for him about two weeks before the meeting with regulators
<unk> <unk> after months of fending off intense press criticism returned <unk> only last month shortly after the government formally accused <unk> <unk> of defrauding <unk>
in addition <unk> <unk> last week disclosed that he belatedly had paid n to <unk> <unk> as reimbursement for trips n he and his family took aboard the corporate jet to <unk> <unk> vacation home at <unk> <unk> the bahamas from <unk> through n
<unk> <unk> said <unk> he had meant to pay for the trips at the time but that the matter fell between the cracks
<unk> <unk> his family members and associates also donated n to <unk> <unk> congressional campaigns over the years according to press accounts
but <unk> <unk> says <unk> <unk> <unk> broke off their friendship abruptly in <unk> because the senator refused to press the thrift executive case as vigorously as <unk> <unk> wanted
he became very angry at that left my office and told a number of people that i was a wimp <unk> <unk> recalls
in <unk> <unk> newspapers disclosed that <unk> <unk> gave <unk> in corporate funds to three tax - exempt voter registration organizations in <unk> and <unk> at the behest of <unk> <unk> who conceded that soliciting the money was a pretty stupid thing n to do politically
in addition <unk> <unk> received n in campaign donations through <unk> <unk> and the <unk> democratic party received <unk> in corporate donations for a n get - out-the-vote drive that benefited the senator re - election campaign that year
also in <unk> <unk> newspapers disclosed n in corporate donations by <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> a political committee controlled by <unk> <unk>
that was in addition to <unk> in direct campaign donations arranged by <unk> <unk> to the <unk> senator
<unk> <unk> said <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> should hire a special outside counsel to conduct an investigation as was done in the case of former <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> staff director of the ethics panel would n't comment
<unk> <unk> said <unk> he would cooperate with any inquiry but that his conduct had been entirely proper
<unk> <unk> said <unk> he had been deeply concerned at the time of the meeting that it might seem to be improper but decided n it was entirely appropriate for him to seek fair treatment for a constituent
<unk> <unk> said <unk> he had already made a complete disclosure of his role in the affair and i am completely satisfied to let this matter rest in the hands of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> said when all is said and done i expect to be fully exonerated
<unk> <unk> who had already volunteered his help to the <unk> <unk> of <unk> in any investigation of <unk> <unk> portrayed his role in <unk> as prodding regulators to act
why did n't the <unk> <unk> act sooner he said
that is what <unk> <unk> should ask <unk> be investigated
<unk> industries <unk> said n it reached a preliminary agreement to manufacture <unk> coal rail cars for <unk> <unk> <unk>
trinity estimated the value of the pact at more than n million

it said <unk> the <unk> rail cars are in addition to the <unk> coal rail cars presently being produced for <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> railroad concern
when <unk> opened its doors to foreign investors in <unk> toy makers from <unk> <unk> were among the first n to march in
today with about <unk> of the companies products being made in <unk> the chairman of the <unk> <unk> toys <unk> <unk> <unk> has suggested a new sourcing label made in <unk> by <unk> <unk> companies
the toy makers were pushed across the border by rising labor and land costs in the british colony
but in the wake of the shootings in <unk> on <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> toy industry is worrying about its strong dependence on <unk>
although the manufacturers stress that production has n't been affected by <unk> political turmoil they are looking for additional sites
the toy makers and their foreign buyers cite uncertainty about <unk> economic and political policies
nobody wants to have all his eggs in one basket says <unk> <unk> chairman and chief executive officer of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
indeed <unk> and other leading <unk> <unk> toy makers were setting up factories in <unk> <unk> especially in <unk> long before the massacre
their steps were partly prompted by concern over a deterioration of business conditions in southern <unk>
by diversifying supply sources the toy makers do n't intend to withdraw from <unk> manufacturers and foreign buyers say n
it would n't be easy to duplicate quickly the manufacturing capacity built up in southern <unk> during the past decade
a supply of cheap labor and the access to <unk> <unk> port airport banks and support industries such as printing companies have made <unk> <unk> province a premier manufacturing site
<unk> <unk> is the most competitive source of toys in the world says <unk> <unk> executive director of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> trade figures illustrate the toy makers reliance on factories across the border
in n exports of domestically produced toys and games fell n from n to <unk> $ n billion us$ n billion
but re - exports mainly from <unk> jumped n to <unk> $ n billion
in <unk> first seven months domestic exports fell n to <unk> $ n billion while re - exports rose n to <unk> $ n billion
manufacturers say n there is no immediate substitute for southern <unk> where an estimated n people are employed by the toy industry
for the next few years like it or not <unk> is going to be the main supplier says <unk> <unk> vice president of <unk> enterprises <unk> one of the first big <unk> <unk> toy makers n to move across the border
in the meantime as manufacturers and buyers seek new sites they are focusing mainly on <unk> <unk>
several big companies have established manufacturing joint ventures in <unk> including <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> the toy manufacturer headed by <unk> <unk>
<unk> the philippines and <unk> also are being studied
with the <unk> <unk> set to remove its internal trade barriers in <unk> several <unk> <unk> companies are beginning to consider <unk> <unk> and <unk> as possible manufacturing sites
worries about <unk> came just as <unk> <unk> toy industry was recovering from a n sales slump and bankruptcy filings by two major <unk> companies <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> industries <unk>

the industry regards last year and this year as a period of recovery that will lead to improved results
still they long for a mega - hit toy to excite retail sales in the <unk> <unk> <unk> biggest market for toys and games
the closest thing n the colony companies have to a <unk> mega - hit this year is the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> series of action figures manufactured by <unk> holdings <unk>

should sales continue to be strong through the <unk> season which accounts for about <unk> of <unk> retail toy sales <unk> <unk> said <unk> the <unk> <unk> could make <unk> a record sales year for <unk>
other <unk> <unk> manufacturers expect their results to improve only slightly this year from <unk>
besides the lack of a fast - selling product they cite the continued dominance of the <unk> market by <unk> <unk> <unk> an expensive video game made by <unk> <unk> of <unk>
<unk> buyers have little money left to spend on other products
many of the toy makers problems started well before <unk> <unk> as a result of overstrained infrastructure and <unk> austerity programs launched late last year
toy makers complain that electricity in <unk> has been provided only three days a week in recent months down from five days a week as the province rapid industrialization has outstripped its generating capacity
manufacturers are upgrading standby power plants
<unk> credit for <unk> investments all but dried up following <unk> n
also concern exists that the harder - line <unk> leadership will tighten its control of <unk> which has been the main laboratory for the open - door policy and economic reforms
but toy manufacturers and other industrialists say n <unk> will be restrained from tightening controls on export - oriented southern <unk>
they say <unk> <unk> trade deficit is widening and the country is too short of foreign exchange for it to hamper production in <unk>
the chinese leaders have to decide whether they want control or whether the want exports says <unk> <unk> of <unk>
the <unk> administration urging the <unk> <unk> to give states more leeway to restrict abortions said n minors have n't any right to abortion without the consent of their parents
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> argued that the <unk> <unk> <unk> decision <unk> vs. <unk> recognizing a constitutional right to abortion was incorrect
he also argued that the high court was wrong in <unk> to rule that minors have a right to abortion that ca n't be absolutely vetoed by their parents
the administration position was outlined in a friend - of-the-court brief filed in one of three abortion cases n the <unk> <unk> will hear argued and will decide this term
the administration filed the brief in an appeal involving a <unk> law that requires that both parents of a minor be notified before she may have an abortion
the administration urged the justices to adopt a legal standard suggested by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> last <unk> when the high court upheld <unk> abortion restrictions
under that standard which garnered the votes of only three of the nine justices a state restriction of abortion is constitutional if the state has a reasonable justification for adopting it
that is a much easier standard n for a state to satisfy than the <unk> <unk> test since <unk> which requires a state to have a compelling reason for restricting abortion
on the provisions of the <unk> law the <unk> administration said that requiring that both parents be notified is a reasonable regulation and that there is no need to have an alternative that allows minors to go to court for a judge permission instead
the case <unk> vs. <unk> will be argued <unk> n
<unk> <unk> of <unk> hit hard by the strength of the dollar overseas said n net income for the third quarter dropped <unk> to n million or <unk> a share
the nation no . n aluminum maker earned n million or <unk> a share a year earlier
revenue rose <unk> to n billion from n billion
analysts who were expecting <unk> to post around <unk> to n a share were surprised at the lackluster third - quarter results
it disappointing said <unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
much of the earnings decline was led by currency - exchange rate adjustments which affected the bottom line by n million or n cents a share compared with n million or four cents a share the previous year
lower prices for aluminum ingots and certain alloy products and a shift in the product mix also contributed to lower earnings the company said n
in addition costs were higher partly due to scheduled plant outages for modernization work the company said
excluding the higher tax rate which rose two percentage points to <unk> and the negative exchange rate adjustment the company would have met analysts expectations said <unk> <unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk> <unk>
noting that the third quarter is usually the aluminum industry slowest <unk> <unk> added the third quarter is never a bang up period for them anyway
nevertheless the company said n shipments were up slightly to <unk> metric tons from <unk> buffing the impact of the unexpected earning decline

for n years federal rules have barred the three major television networks from sharing in one of the most lucrative and fastest - growing parts of the television business
and for six years <unk> <unk> and <unk> have negotiated with <unk> studios in a futile attempt to change that
but with foreign companies snapping up <unk> movie studios the networks are pressing their fight harder than ever
they hope <unk> the foreign deals will divide the <unk> opposition and prod <unk> to push for ending federal rules that prohibit the networks from grabbing a piece of rerun sales and owning part of the shows n they put on the air
even network executives however admit privately that victory either in <unk> or in talks with the studios is highly doubtful any time soon
and so the networks also are pushing for new ways <unk> to sidestep the fin - syn provisions known formally as the <unk> <unk> and <unk> rules
that became clear last week with the disclosure that <unk> <unk> <unk> backed by the deep pockets of parent <unk> <unk> <unk> had tried to help fund <unk> <unk> <unk> now - scuttled <unk> billion bid for <unk> communications <unk>
<unk> interest may revive the deal which <unk> killed last week when the australian concern had trouble raising cash
even if that deal is n't revived <unk> hopes to find another
our doors are open an <unk> spokesman says
<unk> may yet find a way n to take a passive minority interest in a program - maker without violating the rules
and any <unk> effort could prompt <unk> <unk> and <unk> parent <unk> <unk> <unk> to look for ways of skirting the fin - syn regulations
but the networks push may only aggravate an increasingly bitter rift between them and <unk> studios
both sides are to sit down next month for yet another meeting on how they might agree on reducing fin - syn restraints
few people privy to the talks expect the studios to budge
the networks still are uninhibited in their authority over what shows get on the air charges <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the most vociferous opponent of rescinding the rules
studios are powerless to get shows in prime - time lineups and keep them there long enough to go into lucrative rerun sales he contends n
and that why the rules for the most part must stay in place he says n
studio executives in on the talks including officials at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> communications <unk> and <unk> <unk> declined to be interviewed
but <unk> <unk> who represents the studios asserts <unk> the whole production industry to a man is on the side of preserving the rules
such proclamations leave network officials all the more doubtful that the studios will bend
they do n't seem to have an incentive to negotiate says one network executive
and there no indication that <unk> is prepared to address the rules
that the problem is n't it
indeed it is
<unk> has said repeatedly <unk> it wants no part of the mess urging the studios and the networks which license rights to air shows made by the studios to work out their own compromise
but recent developments have made the networks and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in particular ever more adamant that the networks must be unshackled to survive
the latest provocation <unk> <unk> plan to acquire <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for n billion and to buy independent producer <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for n million
i wonder what <unk> <unk> will think of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> broadcast exclusively from <unk> wrote <unk> <unk> an <unk> vice president in a commentary in last week issue of <unk> magazine
in his article <unk> <unk> who was in <unk> last week and unavailable complained that the archaic restraints in fin - syn rules have contributed directly to the acquisition of the studios by non - <unk> enterprises
he did n't mention that <unk> in the meantime was hoping to assist <unk> <unk> in
an <unk> spokesman counters that <unk> <unk> lament was entirely consistent with <unk> plans because the <unk> rules would limit <unk> involvement in the <unk> deal so severely as to be light years away from the type of unrestrained deals available to <unk> and everyone else except the three networks
the <unk> three drumbeat for deregulation began intensifying in the summer when the former <unk> <unk> went ahead with plans to acquire <unk>
although <unk> already had a long - term contract to buy movies from <unk> the merger will let <unk> largely unregulated pay - cable channel <unk> <unk> <unk> own the <unk> movies aired on <unk> a vertical integration that is effectively blocked by fin - syn regulations
<unk> <unk> <unk> led the way in decrying the networks inability to match a <unk> - <unk> combination
he spoke up again when the <unk> bid for <unk> was announced
since <unk> interest in the <unk> bid for <unk> was disclosed <unk> <unk> has n't been available for comment
with a <unk> deal <unk> would move into uncharted territory possibly raising hackles at the studios and in <unk>
it never really been tested says <unk> <unk> <unk> who as a top <unk> executive spent years lobbying to have the rules lifted
he now runs <unk> communications in <unk> consulting to media companies
<unk> - <unk> rules do n't explicitly block a network from buying a passive small stake in a company that profits from the rerun syndication n networks ca n't enjoy
hence <unk> might be able to take say a <unk> stake in a company such as <unk>
if the transaction raised objections the studio syndication operations could be spun off into a separate firm in which the network does n't have a direct stake
but such convolutions would still block the networks from grabbing a big chunk of the riches of syndication
under current rules even when a network fares well with a <unk> series <unk> for example made a killing in broadcasting its popular crime\/comedy moonlighting it is n't allowed to share in the continuing proceeds when the reruns are sold to local stations
instead <unk> will have to sell off the rights for a one - time fee
the networks admit that the chances of getting the relief n they want are slim for several years at the least
six years ago they were tantalizingly close
the <unk> - era <unk> communications <unk> had ruled in favor of killing most of the rules
various evidence including a <unk> <unk> study of some <unk> series that the networks had aired and had partly owned in the <unk> showed <unk> the networks did n't wield undue control over the studios as had been alleged
but just eight days before the rules were to die former <unk> <unk> <unk> a one - time actor intervened on behalf of <unk>
the <unk> effort collapsed
the networks and studios have bickered ever since
<unk> officials involved in the studio talks may hope <unk> the foreign influx builds more support in <unk> but that seems unlikely
in <unk> the issue falters it about money not program quality and <unk> has lots of clout given its fund raising for senators and representatives overseeing the issue
a spokesman for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> - <unk> . who heads a subcommittee that oversees the <unk> says <unk> <unk> <unk> feels n the world has been forever changed by the <unk> - <unk> deal
but he said <unk> <unk> <unk> hopes <unk> this pushes the networks and studios to work it out on their own
and at the <unk> meanwhile new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has said <unk> he wants the two sides to hammer out their own plan
<unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> it settled a civil action filed against it by the federal government on behalf of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
the government sued the company in <unk> seeking <unk> and other unspecified damages related to an alleged contract - steering scheme
the suit named the company former chief executive officer <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> former vice president <unk> <unk> <unk> and five defendants who were n't part of the company
the suit charged the defendants with causing <unk> <unk> <unk> an ex - member of the <unk> <unk> board of governors to accept n in bribes kickbacks and gratuities
<unk> <unk> was previously sentenced to four years in prison and fined <unk> for his role in the scheme
in the agreement <unk> agreed to pay the government n in return for the release of all claims against the company <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
the five additional defendants were n't parties to the settlement
a trial on criminal allegations against the company and the same two former executives began <unk> n in federal court for the <unk> of <unk>
they were indicted last <unk> on charges of fraud theft and conspiracy related to an effort to win n million in <unk> <unk> equipment contracts by the maker of data management equipment
the company and its executives deny the charges
in a related development <unk> <unk> said <unk> the <unk> <unk> has barred the company from bidding on postal contracts for an additional n days
the <unk> <unk> originally suspended the company <unk> n <unk> and has been renewing the ban ever since
the company said n it will continue to pursue a lifting of the suspension
<unk> <unk> reported a n drop in third - quarter net income partly because of a one - time charge for discontinued operations
the big semiconductor and computer maker said n it had net of n million or n cents down n from n million or n cents a share
the lower net included a charge of n million equal to <unk> cents a share on an after - tax basis for the cost of abandoning a computer - systems joint venture with <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
earning also fell from the year - ago period because of slowing microchip demand
sales amounted to n million down <unk> from n million
<unk> stock rose in early over - the-counter trading <unk> as investors appeared relieved that the company income from continuing operations was only slightly below the second quarter earnings of n million or n cents a share and that sales actually exceeded the n million for the second period
but <unk> later succumbed to the stock market plunge closing at <unk> down <unk>
in <unk> <unk> warned that third - quarter earnings might be flat to down from the previous period because of slowing sales growth of its <unk> microprocessor start - up costs associated with a line of computers and costs of preparing for mass shipments of the company new n chip in the current quarter
on <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> president and chief executive officer said <unk> <unk> business is strong
our bookings improved as the quarter progressed and <unk> was especially good
for the full quarter our bookings were higher than the previous quarter and our book - to-bill ratio exceeded n
for the nine - month period <unk> reported net of n million or <unk> a share down <unk> from n million or <unk> a share
revenue amounted to <unk> billion up slightly from <unk> billion
<unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> came home yesterday
after n years in prison <unk> <unk> the <unk> former secretary - general of the liberation movement was dropped off at his house by a prison services van just as the sun was coming up
at the same time six <unk> colleagues five of whom were arrested with him in <unk> and sentenced to life imprisonment were reunited with their families at various places around the country
and as the graying men returned to their homes the <unk> outlawed in <unk> <unk> since <unk> and still considered to be the chief public enemy by the white government defiantly returned to the streets of the country black townships
a huge <unk> flag with black green and gold stripes was hoisted over the rickety gate at <unk> <unk> modest house while on the street out front boys displayed the <unk> colors on their shirts caps and scarves
at the small four - room home of <unk> <unk> a leading <unk> unionist and a former commander in the group armed wing <unk> we sizwe well - wishers stuck little <unk> flags in their hair and a man tooted on an antelope horn wrapped in <unk> ribbons
i am happy to see the spirit of the people said <unk> <unk> looking dapper in a new gray suit
as the crowd outside his home shouted <unk> <unk> the old man shot his fists into the air
i inspired by the mood of the people
under the laws of the land the <unk> remains an illegal organization and its headquarters are still in <unk> <unk>
but the unconditional release of the seven leaders who once formed the intellectual and organizational core of the <unk> is a de facto unbanning of the movement and the rebirth of its internal wing
the government can never put the <unk> back into the bottle again said <unk> <unk> a veteran anti - apartheid activist on hand to welcome <unk> <unk>
things have gone too far for the government to stop them now
there no turning back
there was certainly no stopping the tide of <unk> emotion last night when hundreds of people jammed into the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> for what became the first <unk> rally in the country in n years
deafening chants of <unk> and <unk> we <unk> shook the church as the seven aging men vowed that the <unk> would continue its fight against the government and the policies of racial segregation on all fronts including the armed struggle
and they called on the government to release <unk> <unk> the <unk> leading figure who was jailed with them and remains in prison
without him said <unk> <unk> <unk> the freeing of the others is only a half - measure
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> released the <unk> men along with one of the founding members of the <unk> <unk> <unk> a rival liberation group as part of his efforts to create a climate of trust and peace in which his government can begin negotiations with black leaders over a new constitution aimed at giving blacks a voice in national government
but <unk> may instead be creating a climate for more turmoil and uncertainty in this racially divided country
as other repressive governments particularly <unk> and the <unk> <unk> have recently discovered initial steps to open up society can create a momentum for radical change that becomes difficult if not impossible to control
as the days go by the south african government will be ever more hard pressed to justify the continued imprisonment of <unk> <unk> as well as the continued banning of the <unk> and enforcement of the state of emergency
if it does n't yield on these matters and eventually begin talking directly to the <unk> the expectations and promise raised by yesterday releases will turn to disillusionment and unrest
if it does the large number of right - wing whites who oppose any concessions to the black majority will step up their agitation and threats to take matters into their own hands
the newly released <unk> leaders also will be under enormous pressure
the government is watching closely to see if their presence in the townships leads to increased anti - government protests and violence if it does <unk> will use this as a reason n to keep <unk> <unk> behind bars
<unk> has n't forgotten why they were all sentenced to life imprisonment in the first place for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government
in addition the government is figuring that the releases could create a split between the internal and external wings of the <unk> and between the newly freed leaders and those activists who have emerged as leaders inside the country during their imprisonment
in order to head off any divisions <unk> <unk> in a meeting with his colleagues before they were released instructed them to report to the <unk> headquarters in <unk> as soon as possible
the men also will be faced with bridging the generation gap between themselves and the country many militant black youths the so - called young lions who are anxious to see the old lions in action
says <unk> <unk> president of the south <unk> <unk> <unk> we will be expecting them to act like leaders of the <unk>
they never considered themselves to be anything else
at last night rally they called on their followers to be firm yet disciplined in their opposition to apartheid
we emphasize discipline because we know that the government is very very sensitive said <unk> <unk> another early <unk> leader who is now n
we want to see <unk> <unk> and all our comrades out of prison and if we are n't disciplined we may not see them here with us
