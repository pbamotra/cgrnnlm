confidence in the pound is widely expected to take another sharp dive if trade figures for <unk> due for release tomorrow fail to show a substantial improvement from <unk> and <unk> near - record deficits
<unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> restated commitment to a firm monetary policy has helped to prevent a freefall in sterling over the past week
but analysts reckon n underlying support for sterling has been eroded by the chancellor failure to announce any new policy measures in his <unk> <unk> speech last <unk>
this has increased the risk of the government being forced to increase base rates to <unk> from their current n level to defend the pound economists and foreign exchange market analysts say n
the risks for sterling of a bad trade figure are very heavily on the down side said <unk> <unk> senior <unk> economist at <unk> <unk> <unk>
if there is another bad trade number there could be an awful lot of pressure noted <unk> <unk> <unk> economist for <unk> <unk> a unit of <unk> <unk> <unk>
forecasts for the trade figures range widely but few economists expect the data to show a very marked improvement from the <unk> billion n billion deficit in the current account reported for <unk>
the <unk> deficit and the <unk> billion gap registered in <unk> are topped only by the <unk> billion deficit of <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> european economist at <unk> brothers <unk> said <unk> there is no sign that <unk> manufacturing industry is transforming itself to boost exports
at the same time he remains fairly pessimistic about the outlook for imports given continued high consumer and capital goods inflows
he reckons n the current account deficit will narrow to only n billion in <unk>
however <unk> <unk> said <unk> he believes that a reduction in raw material stockbuilding by industry could lead to a sharp drop in imports
combined with at least some rebound in exports after <unk> unexpected decline the deficit could narrow to as little as n billion
<unk> <unk> who also forecasts a n billion current account gap warns that even if the trade figures are bullish for sterling the currency wo n't advance much because investors will want to see further evidence of the turnaround before adjusting positions
nevertheless he noted n no one will want to go into the trade figures without a flat position in the pound
meanwhile overall evidence on the economy remains fairly clouded
in his <unk> <unk> speech <unk> <unk> warned that a further slowdown can be expected as the impact of the last rise in interest rates earlier this month takes effect
<unk> base rates are at their highest level in eight years
but consumer expenditure data released <unk> do n't suggest that the <unk> economy is slowing that quickly
the figures show that spending rose n in the third quarter from the second quarter and was up n from a year ago
this compares with a <unk> rise in the second from the first quarter and a <unk> increase from the second quarter of <unk>
<unk> <unk> said n the data show <unk> the economy is still quite strong but suggestions that much of the spending went on services rather than consumer goods should reduce fears of more import rises
certainly the chancellor has made it clear that he is prepared to increase interest rates again if necessary to both ensure that a substantial slowdown does take place and that sterling does n't decline further
<unk> he reminded his audience that the government can not allow the necessary rigor of monetary policy to be undermined by exchange rate weakness
analysts agree n there is little holding sterling firm at the moment other than <unk> <unk> promise that rates will be pushed higher if necessary
and they warn n any further drop in the government popularity could swiftly make this promise sound hollow
sterling was already showing some signs of a lack of confidence in <unk> <unk> promise <unk>
in european trading it declined to <unk> and n marks from <unk> and <unk> marks late <unk>
economists suggested that if the pound falls much below n marks the government will be forced to increase rates to <unk> both to halt any further decline and ensure that the balance of monetary policy remains unchanged

freight rates declining for most of the decade because of competition spurred by deregulation are bottoming out turning upward and threatening to fuel inflation
trucking shipping and air - freight companies have announced rate increases scheduled for this fall or early next year reflecting higher costs and tightened demand for freight transport
major shippers say n they expect freight rates to rise at least as fast as inflation and maybe faster in the next few years
that a big change from recent years when freight haulage was a bright spot for <unk> productivity helping to restrain inflation and make <unk> industry more competitive abroad
demand has caught up with the supply of certain types of freight transportation and rates are starting to move up at a rate close to or slightly more than the inflation rate said <unk> <unk> director of logistics at <unk> <unk> <unk>
shippers surveyed recently by <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> they expect their freight - transport storage and distribution costs to rise about <unk> this year
only n of the n shippers polled expected their freight - transport costs to decrease compared with n who had looked to freight transport to reduce costs in past years
this is the first year since transportation deregulation in <unk> that we have had such a dramatic and broad - based upturn in perceived transportation rates said <unk> <unk> a transportation logistics professor at <unk> <unk> in <unk>
the deregulation of railroads and trucking companies that began in <unk> enabled shippers to bargain for transportation
carriers could use their equipment more efficiently leading to overcapacity n they were eager to fill
shippers cut about n billion from their annual inter - city truck and rail costs to about <unk> billion or about <unk> of gross national product down from <unk> of <unk> in <unk>
but with much of the inefficiency squeezed out of the freight - transport system rising costs are likely to be reflected directly in higher freight rates
shippers are saying the party over said <unk> <unk>
shippers wo n't be able to look for transportation - cost savings as they have for the last eight or nine years
transport rates wo n't be an opportunity for offsetting cost increases in other segments of the economy
<unk> <unk> a consultant at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said we gotten all the benefits of deregulation in freight - cost reductions
now we are starting to see real freight - rate increases as carriers replace equipment pay higher fuel costs and pay more for labor
you see carriers try to recoup some of the price cutting that occurred previously
not everyone believes that the good times are over for shippers
there still a lot of pressure on rates in both rail and truck said <unk> <unk> lecturer in transportation at <unk> <unk> of <unk>
less - than-truckload companies which carry the freight of several shippers in each truck trailer discounted away a n rate increase implemented last <unk>
the carriers were competing fiercely for market share
railroad - rate increases are likely to be restrained by weakening rail - traffic levels and keen competition for freight from trucks
an official at <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> less - than-truckload carrier said n rate discounting in that industry has begun to stabilize
<unk> <unk> plans to raise its rates n late this year or early next year and at least two competitors have announced similar increases
truckers are trying to send signals that they need to stop the bloodletting forget about market share and go for higher rates said <unk> <unk> <unk> an analyst at <unk> <unk>
and shippers are getting the feeling that they have played one trucker off against another as much as they can he said n
air - freight carriers raised their rates for <unk> products going across the <unk> to <unk> by about n earlier this month
and <unk> <unk> <unk> said n it plans to boost its rates a further n over the next two years
such rate increases will increase the total cost of <unk> products and slow down the rate of increase of <unk> exports said <unk> <unk> <unk> a senior vice president of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> air - freight-forwarding subsidiary of <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>
ship companies carrying bulk commodities such as oil grain coal and iron ore have been able to increase their rates in the last couple of years
some bulk shipping rates have increased <unk> to <unk> in the past few months said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>

<unk> <unk> stewed over a letter from his manager putting him on probation for insubordination
<unk> <unk> thought <unk> the discipline was unfair he believed that his manager wanted to get rid of him for personal reasons
unable to persuade the manager to change his decision he went to a company court for a hearing
at the scheduled time <unk> <unk> entered a conference room in a building near where he worked
after the three members of the court introduced themselves the chairman of the panel said go ahead and tell us what happened
we may ask questions as you go along or we may wait until the end
no lawyers or tape recorders were present
the only extra people were a couple of personnel specialists one of whom knew <unk> <unk> case intimately and would help fill in any facts needed to give the court the full picture
over a cup of coffee <unk> <unk> told his story
he talked about <unk> minutes
when he was through the court members asked many questions then the chairman said <unk> they would like to hear his manager side and talk to witnesses
the chairman promised <unk> <unk> a decision within two weeks
<unk> <unk> is a fictional name but the incident described is real
it happened at <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
the court is called the <unk> <unk> <unk> or just <unk> and it is likely to hear a couple of dozen cases a year
alter some details of this example and it could be taking place today at <unk> <unk> in <unk> the <unk> and <unk> <unk> divisions of <unk> in <unk> a <unk> <unk> plant in <unk> <unk> or a number of other companies
these firms are pioneers in a significant new trend in the corporate world the rise of what i call corporate due process
although corporate due process is practiced today in few companies perhaps <unk> to <unk> it is one of the fastest developing trends in industry
in the coming decade a majority of people - oriented companies are likely to adopt it
corporate due process appeals to management for a variety of reasons
it reduces lawsuits from disgruntled employees and ex - employees with all <unk> that means for reduced legal costs and better public relations
it helps to keep out unions
it increases employee commitment to the company with all <unk> that means for efficiency and quality control
what must your management team do to establish corporate due process
here are four key steps
<unk> make sure n you have a strong personnel department
it must be able to handle most of the complaints that can not be solved in the trenches by managers and their subordinates else the company court or adjudicators will be inundated with cases
at <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> may hear only about n cases a year the rest of the many hundreds of complaints are resolved at earlier stages
at <unk> the <unk> <unk> of <unk> hears <unk> to n cases a year only a fraction of the complaints brought to personnel specialists
at <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> may hear only n or so cases because of personnel skill in complaint - resolution
in a typical year up to <unk> of the work force goes to personnel specialists with complaints of unfair treatment
in a large company that means many hundreds of complaints for personnel n to handle
n formally or informally train all your managers and supervisors in the company due - process approach
see that they know company personnel policy backwards and forwards for it is the law governing company courts and adjudicators
<unk> them in handling complaints so that they can resolve problems immediately
in case managers and personnel specialists are unsuccessful and subordinates take their complaints to a company court or adjudicator teach managers to accept reversals as a fact of business life for in a good due - process system they are bound to happen
in the <unk> companies n i studied reversal rates range on the average from <unk> to n
n decide whether you want a panel system or a single adjudicator
a panel system like that in the <unk> <unk> example enjoys such advantages as high credibility and for the panelists mutual support
an adjudicator system that is an investigator who acts first as a fact - finder and then switches hats and arbitrates the facts has such advantages as speed flexibility and maximum privacy
<unk> <unk> machines and <unk> of <unk> are among the companies using the single - adjudicator approach
<unk> make your due - process system visible
it wo n't do any good for anybody unless employees know about it
most managements hesitate to go all out in advertising their due - process systems for fear of encouraging cranks and chronic soreheads to file complaints
on the other hand they make sure at a minimum that their systems are described in their employee handbooks and talked up by personnel specialists
<unk> - <unk> <unk> goes further and sometimes features its grievance procedure in closed - circuit tv programs
naturally one of the best ways <unk> to guarantee visibility for your due - process system is for top management to support it
at <unk> the company <unk> <unk> system is sometimes the subject of memorandums from the chief executive
<unk> <unk> goes further in this respect than any company <unk> i know of with both <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> chief executive and chief operating officer respectively sitting in on the <unk> <unk> almost every <unk> to decide cases

the <unk> is required to notify foreign dictators if it knows of coup plans likely to endanger their lives government officials said n
the notification policy was part of a set of guidelines on handling coups outlined in a secret n exchange of letters between the <unk> administration and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
the existence of the guidelines has become known since <unk> <unk> disclosed them privately to seven republican senators at a <unk> <unk> meeting last <unk>
officials familiar with the meeting said <unk> <unk> <unk> cited the policy as an example of the sort of congressional requirements <unk> the administration contends <unk> contribute to the failure of such covert actions as this month futile effort to oust panamanian dictator <unk> <unk>
according to the officials <unk> <unk> even read to the senators selections from a highly classified letter from the committee to the <unk> <unk> discussing the guidelines
they said n the president conceded <unk> the notification requirement did n't affect his decision to lend only minor support to this month <unk> coup effort
no notification was ever considered officials said n apparently because the <unk> did n't think n the coup plotters intended to kill <unk> <unk> but merely sought to imprison him
what more both administration and congressional officials hint that the notification requirement is likely to be dropped from the guidelines on coup attempts that are being rewritten by the panel and the <unk> <unk>
the rewriting was launched at a meeting between <unk> <unk> and intelligence committee leaders <unk> n a few days before the meeting at which the president complained about the rules
however the disclosure of the guidelines first reported last night by <unk> <unk> is already being interpreted on <unk> <unk> as an unfair effort to pressure <unk>
it has reopened the bitter wrangling between the <unk> <unk> and <unk> over who is responsible for the failure to oust <unk> <unk> and more broadly for difficulties in carrying out covert activities abroad
a statement issued by the office of the committee chairman <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> charged that the disclosure is part of a continuing effort to shift the criticism for the failure of the recent coup attempt in <unk>
the statement added someone has regrettably chosen to selectively summarize portions of highly classified correspondence between the two branches of government
not only does this come close to a violation of law it violates the trust n we have all worked to develop
<unk> <unk> said it time n to stop bickering and work together to develop a clear and appropriate policy n to help the country in the future
i invited the president to send his suggestions to the committee
republican <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> the panel vice chairman said of the disclosure that a text torn out of context is a pretext and it is unfair for those in the <unk> <unk> who are leaking to present the evidence in a selective fashion
<unk> <unk> said <unk> the committee could n't defend itself by making the documents public because that would violate classification rules
but the chairman and other committee members stressed that the notification guideline was n't imposed on the <unk> <unk> by a meddling <unk>
instead both congressional and administration officials agreed n it grew out of talks about coup - planning in <unk> that were initiated by the administration in <unk> <unk> and stretched into last <unk>
the guideline was n't a law but a joint interpretation of how the <unk> might operate during foreign coups in light of the longstanding presidential order banning a <unk> role in assassinations
in fact yesterday the administration and <unk> were still differing on what had been agreed to
one administration official said <unk> notification was required even if the <unk> gets wind of somebody else coup plans that seem likely to endanger a dictator life
but a congressional source close to the panel said n the rule only covered coup plans directly involving the <unk>
although the notification guideline was n't carried out in this month coup attempt some administration officials argue that it may have led to hesitation and uncertainty on the part of <unk> intelligence and military operatives in <unk>
one senior administration official called the guideline outrageous and said n it could make <unk> operatives reluctant to even listen to coup plans for fear n they may get into legal trouble
the issue came to a head last year officials recalled <unk> partly because the <unk> administration had sought unsuccessfully to win committee approval of funding for new <unk> coup efforts
in addition both administration and congressional officials said n the need for guidelines on coups and assassinations was partly spurred by a <unk> <unk> desire to avoid nasty overseas surprises during the election campaign
though the assassination ban is a <unk> <unk> order that <unk> never voted on the intelligence committees can exercise influence over its interpretation
last week <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> publicly called on <unk> to provide new interpretations of the assassination order that would permit the <unk> more freedom to act in coups
the administration has reacted to criticism that it mishandled the latest coup attempt by seeking to blame <unk> for restrictions n the <unk> <unk> said <unk> have hampered its freedom of action
however last week <unk> <unk> two top <unk> deputies said n congressional curbs had n't hampered the spy agency role in the coup attempt in <unk>
nevertheless the administration criticisms appeared to have made some headway with sens . <unk> and <unk> after their <unk> n meeting with the president
the three men agreed to rewrite the guidelines without changing the basic assassination ban to clear up any ambiguities that may have hampered <unk> encouragement of coups against anti - american leaders
the new argument over the notification guideline however could sour any atmosphere of cooperation that existed

he surveys the prospective investors gathered in the board room of the philippine government <unk> <unk> <unk> for the sale of a <unk> interest in the country largest paper mill
the agency expects the bids to be equivalent of more than n million
not a peso is offered
<unk> <unk> the trust associate executive trustee declares the bidding a failure
it getting harder to sell he mutters as he leaves the room

<unk> is a critical month for the privatization program
<unk> is offering several major assets for the first time and is trying to conclude sales already arranged
in addition the government is scheduled to unveil plans for privatizing <unk> airlines the national carrier an effort that lawyer and business columnist <unk> <unk> calls the bellwether of privatization
all told there are assets on the line valued at up to <unk> billion
the privatization program is designed to rid the government of hundreds of assets and to raise critically needed funds
much of the money from the sales is earmarked for a multibillion - dollar agrarian - reform program
but efforts have been thwarted by official indifference bureaucratic resistance a legal system that operates at a snail pace political opposition and government misjudgments
most recently a lack of buyers has been added to the list
rather than gathering momentum the program is in danger of slowing even more as the government tackles several big assets
the axiom appears to be that the more valuable the asset the harder the privatization process
you just do n't see a whole lot happening says an international economist
to be sure the program has n't completely stalled
the <unk> <unk> <unk> the agency chiefly responsible for selling government - held properties has recorded sales of more than n million since it began functioning in <unk> n
but its success has been largely in the sale of small nonperforming companies which are valued for their assets
dealing with the sales this month could be particularly challenging because almost every problem that has hobbled the program in the past is popping up again
<unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> executive trustee admits to what he calls temporary setbacks
in light of the poor results recently he says <unk> the agency is adopting an attitude of flexibility
<unk> troubles began when the trust failed to sell a state - owned commercial bank <unk> <unk> for the minimum price of n million pesos n million
at the end of the month the agency again will offer the bank
but instead of a minimum price only a target price will be established
bankers say however that the government may have difficulty selling the institution even without a floor price
the bank has a negative net worth they say n
in addition special bidding rules give the bank former owner <unk> <unk> the right to match the highest bid
<unk> <unk> lost control to the government in <unk> when a government bank made emergency loans to the cash - strapped institution
in <unk> the loans were converted into equity giving <unk> <unk> of the bank but with the understanding that <unk> <unk> had repurchase rights
his ability to match any bid has scared off many potential buyers
separately the government will try again within a month to sell the <unk> stake in <unk> <unk> <unk> of the philippines or <unk> as the paper mill is known
the price will depend on how much <unk> shares fetch on the local stock market
but according to bankers and stock analysts who have studied the paper mill price is n't the only consideration
as it stands now the government would continue to hold n of <unk> after the <unk> stake is sold
about <unk> of <unk> is publicly traded and other shareholders own the rest of the equity
potential buyers mostly foreign companies are reluctant to take a non - controlling stake in a company that by the government own reckoning needs some n million in new capital for rehabilitation
the prospect of buying into a cash - hungry company without getting management control persuaded at least three foreign buyers including a member of the <unk> group of <unk> to pull out of the bidding the bankers and analysts say n
<unk> <unk> acknowledges the problem and says <unk> the <unk> <unk> will study why the bidding failed and what changes the agency may be able to offer
under government regulations however foreign ownership of <unk> equity is limited to <unk>
even though the government would retain the <unk> stake in <unk> critics have accused the trust of selling out to foreigners
a series of newspaper articles accused the trust of short - changing the government over the <unk> sale
<unk> <unk> says <unk> he has been notified of congressional hearings on the <unk> bidding and possible legislation covering the paper mill sale both prompted by the criticism of the agency
the question of control could further hinder long - delayed plans for the government to divest itself of <unk> airlines in which it has a <unk> stake

having said that we must caution against an apparent tendency to overstate the case
it is not quite true for example that the mexican government has privatized <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> claims <unk>
in the same sentence he contradicts himself when he reports that the government still retains n of the total equity of the airline
how can a company be considered privatized if the state is so heavily represented in it
true the mexican government has granted control over the airline to a new private consortium but its propensity to take back what it gives is too well known to permit one to be sanguine
regrettably too <unk> <unk> resorts to the familiar numbers game when he boasts that fewer than n state enterprises currently remain in the public sector down from the <unk> public entities that existed in <unk>
but the enterprises still in state hands include the biggest and most economically powerful ones in <unk> indeed they virtually constitute the economic infrastructure
i refer essentially to petroleum electric power banking and newsprint
those enterprises however are not going to be privatized
they are officially considered strategic and their privatization is prohibited by the mexican <unk>
in language that sidesteps the issue <unk> <unk> writes <unk> the divestiture of nonpriority and nonstrategic public enterprises is an essential element of <unk> <unk> <unk> plan to modernize <unk> economy
yet clearly modernization must embrace its key industries before it can be said to have caught the privatization bug
the bottom line however is not economic but political reform
a long succession of mexican presidents arbitrarily nationalized whatever industry they took a fancy to without having to answer to the public
to guarantee that <unk> <unk> <unk> and other companies will really be privatized <unk> needs a pluri - party political system that will ensure democracy and hence accountability
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> - <unk> <unk>
the board of this <unk> <unk> <unk> concern voted to suspend payment of its quarterly of <unk> cents a share for the third quarter

<unk> <unk> said <unk> the dividend was suspended in anticipation of more stringent capital requirements under the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk>
a labor - management group is preparing a revised buy - out bid for <unk> <unk> parent <unk> <unk> that would transfer majority ownership to employees while leaving some stock in public hands according to people familiar with the group
the group has been discussing a proposal valued in a range of <unk> to n a share or n billion to <unk> billion
but to avoid the risk of rejection the group does n't plan to submit the plan formally at a <unk> board meeting today
instead the group is raising the proposal informally to try to test the board reaction
people familiar with the company say n the board is n't likely to give quick approval to any offer substantially below the <unk> <unk> billion buy - out bid that collapsed last week after banks would n't raise needed loans and after a key partner <unk> <unk> <unk> dropped out
in composite trading <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> closed at <unk> a share down n
but the pilots union which has been pushing for a takeover since n appears to be pressing ahead with the revised bid to avoid further loss of momentum even though it has n't found a partner <unk> to replace british <unk>
although the bidding group has n't had time n to develop its latest idea fully or to discuss it with banks it believes <unk> bank financing could be obtained
after the collapse of the last effort the group does n't plan to make any formal proposal without binding commitments from banks covering the entire amount n to be borrowed
under the type of transaction being discussed the pilot - management group would borrow several billion dollars from banks that could then be used to finance a cash payment to current holders
those current holders would also receive minority interests in the new company
for example the group could offer <unk> a share in cash plus stock valued at <unk> a share
<unk> currently has n million shares fully diluted
the new structure would be similar to a recapitalization in which holders get a special dividend yet retain a controlling ownership interest
the difference is that current holders would n't retain majority ownership or control
the failed takeover would have given <unk> employees n voting control of the nation second - largest airline with management getting n control and british <unk> <unk>
it was n't clear how the ownership would stack up under the new plan but employees would keep more than <unk>
<unk> total could be reduced and the public could get more than the n control that had been earmarked for british <unk>
one option <unk> the board is likely to consider today is some sort of cooling - off period
although the pilots are expected to continue to pursue the bid <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> may be asked to withdraw from the buy - out effort at least temporarily and to return to running the company full time
the board could eventually come under some pressure to sell the company because its members can be ousted by a majority shareholder vote particularly since one - third of <unk> stock is held by takeover stock speculators who favor a sale
the labor - management buy - out group plans to keep its offer on the table in an apparent attempt to maintain its bargaining position with the board
however the only outsider who has emerged to lead such a shareholder vote <unk> <unk> investor <unk> <unk> who triggered the buy - out with a n billion bid in early <unk> is hanging back apparently to avoid being blamed for contributing to the deal collapse
three top advisers to <unk> <unk> visited <unk> <unk> late last week at least in part to confer with executives at <unk>
<unk> <unk> had paid n million for <unk> backing of his last bid
but <unk> has lost some credibility because it also led the unsuccessful effort to gain bank loans for the labor - management group
on <unk> <unk> <unk> issued a statement saying n it does not intend to participate in any new deal for the acquisition of <unk> in the foreseeable future
however several people said that british <unk> might yet rejoin the bidding group and that the carrier made the statement to answer questions from british regulators about how it plans to use proceeds of a securities offering previously earmarked for the <unk> buy - out
also late last week <unk> flight attendants agreed to participate with the pilots in crafting a revised offer
but the machinists union whose opposition helped scuttle the first buy - out bid is likely to favor a recapitalization with a friendly third - party investor
one advantage n the buy - out group intends to press with the board is that pilots have agreed to make n million in annual cost concessions to help finance a bid
speculation has also arisen that the <unk> executive most closely identified with the failure to gain bank financing chief financial officer <unk> <unk> may come under pressure to resign
however people familiar with the buy - out group said <unk> <unk> <unk> departure would weaken the airline management at a critical time
despite the buy - out group failure to obtain financing <unk> remains obligated to pay n million in investment banking and legal fees to the group advisers <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>

with <unk> we just do n't know what to expect
<unk> <unk> does n't seem to be the knee - jerk hardliner <unk> many initially thought <unk> he was when the <unk> <unk> member was selected last week to succeed <unk> <unk>
but he does n't appear to be ready to make broad changes either
according to <unk> <unk> <unk> news agency <unk> <unk> spoke to soviet leader <unk> <unk> by telephone over the weekend and acknowledged <unk> <unk> <unk> could learn from <unk> glasnost policies
already last week <unk> <unk> started overhauling <unk> <unk> heavily censored and notoriously boring news media
on <unk> a day after he took office east german television broke into regular programming to launch a talk show in which viewers call in questions n for a panel of officials to answer
the regular nightly news program and daily newspapers are also getting a visible injection of soviet - style glasnost
it was quite a shock says a <unk> <unk> german shopkeeper
for the first time in my life i was n't sure whether i was listening to our news or west german television
other changes including easing restrictions on travel for east germans are expected
but whether such moves can win back the confidence of east germans who have taken to the streets by the thousands in recent weeks to demand democratic changes depends largely on whether they feel n they can trust <unk> <unk>
and that a problem
<unk> <unk> is not only closely identified with his mentor <unk> <unk> but also blamed for ordering violent police action against protesters this month and for praising <unk> for sending tanks against student demonstrators
i hope <unk> he grows with the job says <unk> <unk> a protestant pastor in <unk> <unk>
the most important thing is that he have a chance
although <unk> <unk> is dedicated to <unk> <unk> conservative vein of communism there is much about his style that sets him apart from his party comrades
unlike <unk> <unk> who tended to lecture people about socialist values <unk> <unk> enjoys asking questions
indeed one of his first actions as leader was to visit a gritty machine factory on the outskirts of <unk> and wander among the workers a la <unk>
he was later shown on television fielding questions
at one point he asked a worker whether he thought <unk> <unk> germans were fleeing the country because of restrictive travel policies
the worker tart reply it more than just travel
people have a sense n the government is ignoring the real problems in our society
the exchange was all the more remarkable in that authorities released television footage to western news agencies
this same tendency toward openness impressed a group of visiting <unk> congressmen this spring
rather than trying to lecture us says <unk> one congressional aide who attended the two - hour meeting <unk> <unk> wanted to listen
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> one of the members of the delegation says <unk> he was particularly impressed by <unk> <unk> ready admission that <unk> <unk> needed to change
he a very tough man but one who also open to arguments adds an aide to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
but there another side to <unk> <unk>
born in a baltic town in an area which is now part of <unk> he has dedicated his life to the party apparatus
he moved quickly through the ranks with the help of his patron <unk> <unk> and emerged as the heir apparent
<unk> <unk> an expert on <unk> <unk> at <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> says <unk> <unk> <unk> may project a smooth image but she doubts n he a true reformer
even if he is she adds n he appears to have only limited room for maneuver within the <unk> <unk> ruling <unk>
against this background the new east german leader must move quickly to shore up his government standing
the sudden growth of the opposition movement together with the steady outflow of citizens escaping through <unk> and <unk> has plunged the country into its deepest political crisis since an anti - soviet workers uprising in <unk>
he does n't have any honeymoon period says a western diplomat based in <unk> <unk>
but if he sharp and quick he has a chance
the diplomat adds that <unk> <unk> has several things going for him
the east german economy is strong compared with other <unk> <unk> nations
and his relative youth could help him project a more vibrant image contrasting with the perception of <unk> <unk> as an out - of-touch old man
for average east germans <unk> <unk> remains a puzzle
either he was n't being real in the past or he is n't being real right now says a <unk> east german doctor
either way i have a problem with how quickly he changed
the doctor was among dozens of people milling through east <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> morning
the walls of the church are covered with leaflets news clippings and handwritten notes associated with the country political opposition
i have to come here to read the walls says the doctor because it information n i still ca n't get through the newspapers
meanwhile <unk> <unk> growing openness may even allow the state - controlled news media to display a muted sense of humor
television last week carried a new report on <unk> <unk> main wallpaper factory and the need to boost production
east germans remember a comment a few years ago by <unk> <unk> the government top ideologist that just because a neighbor hangs new wallpaper there no reason n to change your own
his point was n there is no reason for <unk> <unk> to copy soviet - style changes

the list of laboratories claiming to be producing inexplicable amounts of heat from cold fusion experiments is slowly growing
but the experiments continue to be plagued by lack of firm evidence that the extra heat is coming from the fusing of hydrogen atoms
new experiments at some of the big national laboratories are still unable to find hints of nuclear fusion reactions leaving only the finding of tritium in a <unk> experiment to support <unk> of <unk> chemists claim of achieving hydrogen fusion at room temperatures
the latest developments in cold fusion research were presented in <unk> reports delivered at the fall meeting here of the <unk> <unk> the first scientific meeting in five months n to hear formal reports on cold fusion experiments
the meeting offered stark evidence of a dramatic fall in scientific interest in cold fusion research
of the n chemists registered for the society weeklong meeting fewer than n sat through the day and a half of cold fusion presentations at week end
this was in contrast with the society meeting last <unk> at the height of the controversy when more than <unk> scientists along with scores of reporters and tv crews crowded into a <unk> <unk> hotel ballroom for a tumultuous special night session on the subject
neither of the two chemists whose <unk> experiments triggered the cold fusion uproar <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> were at the meeting
but some members of an ad hoc expert committee set up by the <unk> of <unk> to evaluate the cold fusion research were in the audience
the committee is to recommend at the end of the month whether <unk> should support cold fusion research
most of the two dozen scientists taking the podium reported results with new more sophisticated variations of the seemingly simple electrolysis - of-water experiments described last <unk> by <unk> <unk> and <unk>
the experiments involve encircling a thin rod of palladium metal with a wire of platinum and plunging the two electrodes into heavy water in which the hydrogen atoms are a doubly heavy form known as deuterium
when an electric current is applied to the palladium and platinum electrodes the heavy water did begin to break up or dissociate
ordinarily the electrolysis or breakup of the water would consume almost all of the electrical energy
but messrs. <unk> and <unk> said <unk> their experiments also produced large amounts of heat
the heat energy plus the energy consumed by the breakup of the water molecules added to far more energy coming out of the apparatus than electrical energy going in they reported n
because they also detected tritium and indications of nuclear radiation they asserted that the excess heat energy must be coming from energy released by the nuclear fusion of deuterium atoms inside the palladium rod
as of last weekend a dozen labs also have reported measuring excess heat from similar electrolytic experiments although amounts of such heat vary widely
one of the seven reports presented here of excess heat production was given by <unk> <unk> <unk> professor of chemical engineering at the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> <unk> said <unk> his skepticism of the <unk> claims was initially confirmed when his first experiments last spring failed to produce results
but he then borrowed a palladium rod from chemists at <unk> <unk> who said n they were getting excess heat
the results were fascinating he said
on the fourth run with the borrowed rod the experiment began producing excess heat
the experiment was stopped briefly to change an instrument
when it was restarted heat output really took off and produced excess heat for several hours before dying down he said n
typical of other experiments <unk> <unk> said <unk> his experiment was very erratic
it would go along doing nothing but dissociating the heavy water and then at totally unpredictable times it would begin producing excess heat for as long as <unk> or <unk> hours before quieting down
the excess heat was <unk> to <unk> more than the energy involved in the electrolysis of water
<unk> <unk> said <unk> the heat bursts were too large and too long n to be explained by the sudden release of energy that might have slowly accumulated during the experiments quiescent times as some scientists have suggested
there is a reality to the excess energy he said
other scientists said n they also were getting sporadic bursts of excess heat lasting several hours at a time
the bursts often occur they said n after they perturbed the experiments by raising or lowering the amount of electric current being applied or switching the current off and on
one chemist privately suggested n this hinted that some anomalous chemical reactions might be producing the heat
one reason n questions surround the heat experiments is that they involve unusually meticulous measurements
typically the input energy ranges from a third of a watt to one watt and the excess energy is measured in tenths of a watt
one exception is a continuing experiment at <unk> <unk> where as much as <unk> watts of energy are being put into the electrolytic cells
a cell filled with heavy water is producing <unk> to n watts more heat than an identical electrolytic cell filled with ordinary water next to it reported <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> an associate of materials scientist <unk> <unk> <unk> head of the <unk> experimental team
one of the few hints n the excess heat might be produced by fusion came from brief remarks by chemist <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> previously reported getting bursts of excess heat and of detecting increasing amounts of tritium forming in the heavy water
he said that within the past few days he gotten evidence that there is a weak correlation between the time n the heat bursts occur and the production of tritium
there is n't any way n to continuously measure the amount of tritium in the heavy water so it been difficult to tell whether the tritium formation is related to the heat bursts or some other phenomenon
increasingly careful attempts to measure neutrons which would be strong evidence of fusion reactions continue to be negative
messrs. <unk> and <unk> initially reported indirect evidence of neutrons being produced in their experiment but later conceded n the measurements were questionable
researchers at <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> reported <unk> they went so far as to take a cold fusion experiment and three neutron detectors into a tunnel under n feet of granite to shield the detectors from cosmic rays
a number of times they detected neutrons in one sometimes two of the three detectors but only once during n hours of the experiment did they detect a neutron burst in all three detectors and they think n that was a spurious event
<unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> researchers there detected a burst of neutrons from an early cold fusion experiment last <unk> but decided not to announce it until they could confirm it
in subsequent experiments one of two neutron detectors occasionally indicated a burst of neutrons but neutron bursts were never recorded in both detectors at the same time
they concluded n the indications of neutrons stemmed from faults in the detectors rather than from the cold fusion experiment
at the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> new experiments indicated that the lithium added to the heavy water so it will conduct a current can produce previously unsuspected electrical effects on the surface of the palladium rod which messrs. <unk> and <unk> might have misinterpreted reported <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> laboratory
<unk> <unk> <unk> announced <unk> <unk> <unk> advertising rates for n

looking ahead to other commodity markets this week
livestock and
analysts expect the prices of live cattle futures contracts to rise in trading today in the wake of a government quarterly census that found fewer - than-expected cattle on feedlots
after the close of trading <unk> the <unk> <unk> reported that feedlots in the <unk> biggest ranch states held n million cattle on <unk> n down n from that date a year earlier
most analysts had expected the government to report a <unk> decline
feedlots fatten young cattle for slaughter so a decline signals a tightening supply of beef
the government reported that the number of young cattle placed on feedlots during the quarter dropped <unk> compared with the year - earlier quarter
many industry analysts had been projecting a <unk> decline in placements for the quarter
in the <unk> quarter many farmers were forced to sell their cattle to feedlot operators because the drought dried out the pasture on their ranches
the number of cattle moving onto feedlots in the recent quarter was also lower because fattening cattle is less profitable
a shortage of young cattle has made them more expensive for feedlot operators to buy
the <unk> <unk> also said that the number of fattened cattle slaughtered in the quarter dropped by <unk> from the <unk> quarter which was in line with projections by analysts
<unk> <unk> price drop to <unk> in the expiring <unk> contract for <unk> <unk> <unk> crude may well set the tone for trading this week in petroleum futures on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
most traders and analysts attributed the decline to technical factors associated with the contract going off the board
others said that the drop continued the downward correction that been due in the petroleum pits and that such a trend could well continue in the next several trading sessions
barring any petroleum - related news events trading in the days ahead should further test recent projections by oil economists and other market watchers that strong fourth - quarter demand will keep prices firm
copper prices fell sharply <unk> afternoon
for example copper for <unk> delivery settled <unk> cents lower at <unk> a pound
pressure came from several developments including the settlement of two long - term strikes
on <unk> one analyst said <unk> rank - and-file workers ratified a new labor agreement ending a three - month strike at the <unk> <unk> mine in <unk> <unk>
in <unk> the analyst added employees at the <unk> mine who have been out of work since late <unk> when the mine was declared bankrupt by the government accepted a n cut in the n work force
the mine is expected to return to production in about a week
on <unk> selling dominated the afternoon curb session in <unk> which takes place at noon <unk>
the premium of cash copper to the three - month forward offerings narrowed indicating weaker demand for cash copper
long - term support for the <unk> contract was believed to be at <unk> a pound
a technical analyst said n there were a number of stop - loss orders under that level that were touched off when the contract price fell below it
that brought in considerable fund selling which continued until the close of trading
in general it was a bearish close said <unk> <unk> a copper trader at <unk> <unk> <unk> a major commodities trading and brokerage firm
but whether this price break has implications for this week he said n we will know more when the <unk> <unk> <unk> copper stock levels are released <unk> morning
another analyst said <unk> he expected <unk> inventories to be down by about <unk> tons when the weekly report is issued
<unk> <unk> senior commodities analyst at <unk> <unk> said that when traders saw n the market was n't reacting positively to the forecasts of lower <unk> stocks they perceived a bearish sign
he also noted that the japanese who had been buying at prices just above the <unk> level apparently pulled back from the market on <unk>

<unk> - <unk> <unk> will announce today a software program that allows computers in a network to speed up computing tasks by sending the tasks to each other
called <unk> <unk> the program acts something like an auctioneer among a group of computers wired together
if a machine has a big computing task <unk> <unk> asks other computers in the network for bids on the job
it then determines which machine is free to do the task most quickly and sends the task to that machine
<unk> - <unk> claims that the software allows a network to run three times as many tasks as conventional networks and will run each task twice as fast
the new <unk> - <unk> program said <unk> analyst <unk> <unk> at <unk> <unk> <unk> a computer - market research company is a key building block as people move to this new model of distributed processing
in today computer networks some machines often sit idle while others are overtaxed
with the <unk> - <unk> program he said n you get more bang for the buck n you spent on computers
the program which will be shipped in <unk> n runs on the <unk> operating system
<unk> - <unk> will charge <unk> for a license covering n users
the program now works on all <unk> - <unk> and <unk> workstations and on computers made by <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
<unk> - <unk> said n it will sell versions later next year that run on <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> machines
the <unk> <unk> differs from other programs that spread computing tasks around a network
a previously available program called <unk> <unk> <unk> developed by <unk> - <unk> <unk> division for instance takes a task and splits it up into parts divvying up those parts to several computers in a network for simultaneous processing
but programs in individual computers must be revised in order to work with that system
applications wo n't have to be rewritten to work with <unk> <unk> <unk> - <unk> said <unk> and the user of a computer wo n't be able to tell that another machine is doing the work

as hamburger and pizza outlets saturate one area after another franchisers are struggling desperately for market share slashing prices and stepping up costly promotions
the fight is putting a tight squeeze on profits of many threatening to drive the smallest ones out of business and straining relations between the national fast - food chains and their franchisees
the chains used to offer discounts during winter when business was slow but in the last year or so discounting has become a n thing says <unk> <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> franchisee of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> chain
<unk> <unk> sales are up slightly this year <unk> <unk> says <unk> profits will be flat or lower
and <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> licensee of <unk> <unk> who is chairman of the company <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> says n some fast - food outlets could be in serious trouble based on the amount of discounting that seems to be going on
until recently the huge fast - food industry with sales of about <unk> billion last year kept price - skirmishing to a minimum
but early this year <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> unit and <unk> <unk> <unk> slashed prices and stepped up promotions says <unk> <unk> <unk> an analyst for <unk> <unk> <unk>
that brought a chain reaction in the industry
the situation was further aggravated early this month when <unk> set plans to heat up the discounting by offering coupons
it also decided to go national with pizza which it has been test - marketing
now two - for-one deals on pizza are common so are n specials on sandwiches normally priced twice as high
the discounting say n fast - food operators occurs on a scale and with a frequency n they have n't seen before
the result is that some franchisees are running hard just to stay even laying off middle managers and working harder to make less
<unk> <unk> a district manager for <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> operator in <unk> <unk> says n discounting is so prevalent that we have to serve n to n more customers to keep sales level
it almost as if you doing extra work to give away the food he says
<unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> an operator of <unk> restaurants in <unk> says <unk> <unk> we doing is keeping the customers coming but we are n't increasing sales
with fast - food outlets on every corner he like many does n't think n he has a choice in the price war our customers say that they wo n't go into a fast - food store unless they get a coupon
if the battle continues much longer many fast - food businesses will close or merge predicts <unk> <unk> <unk> who owns a string of <unk> <unk> <unk> stores in the <unk>

<unk> <unk> executive vice president and chief financial officer of <unk> says n the company does n't compute much less disclose inflation - adjusted same - store sales
he adds that short - term comparisons can be very misleading because of differences in timing of marketing programs from year to year
profit margins at company - owned <unk> outlets in the <unk> are holding up quite nicely says <unk> <unk>
profits of franchisees have n't been higher since the <unk> he adds n
but <unk> <unk> sanguine outlook is n't matched by many fast - food industry observers
smaller chains and single - store operators will be the first n to fail many in the industry predict n
big franchise groups can ride out the storm a lot longer says <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> operator in <unk> <unk>
the prolonged price pressures are driving a wedge between some franchisers and their franchisees
<unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> franchisee notes that most franchise owners must absorb increases in expenses without any cut in the royalties or portion of sales that they must pay franchisers
franchisees ca n't be forced to go along with a franchiser discounting
but once a franchisee agrees to a promotional program the franchiser can demand full participation to the very end says <unk> <unk> <unk> a principal of <unk> <unk> a <unk> law firm with franchise industry clients
he says <unk> courts have held that antitrust considerations are outweighed in such cases by the need to protect consumers from deceptive marketing
in any case many franchisees in order to stay on good terms with franchisers routinely go along with promotions

dealers say n the budding trade in <unk> <unk> canceled checks is unusual
i do n't know of any living ballplayer that ever done it says <unk> <unk> a dealer in <unk> <unk> and a recognized expert in the field of baseball autographs
an initial batch of <unk> <unk> checks was on sale at a baseball - card show held in <unk> <unk> over <unk> <unk> weekend
<unk> <unk> showed up at the affair to sign autographs for a fee as well
for someone who has everything else <unk> jersey cap and cards his checks might be a nice addition says <unk> <unk> owner of <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> who examined the checks at the <unk> <unk> card show
for years the canceled checks of a small number of well - known baseball players have been bought and sold
but these players were dead
maybe three years ago there were a lot of <unk> <unk> in the hobby and awhile back there were <unk> <unk> checks says <unk> <unk>

<unk> <unk> and its japanese partner <unk> <unk> <unk> agreed to form a joint venture to build a new plant <unk> to produce hot - dipped galvanized sheet products mainly for the automotive market
terms were n't disclosed for the plant which will have annual capacity of <unk> tons
the move by the nation largest steelmaker follows a string of earlier announcements by other major steel companies
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> all have plans to build additional lines for such coated corrosion - resistant steel
the surge in production analysts say n raises questions about capacity outpacing demand
they note that most of the new plants will come on line in n when the current import trade restraint program ends which could result in more imports
there too much capacity contended <unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
i do n't think n there anyone not building one
he does add however that transplanted japanese car makers are boosting the levels of u.s.-made steel in their autos instead of relying heavily on imported steel
that trend could increase demand for hot - dipped galvanized sheet
the hot - dipped galvanized segment is one of the fastest - growing and most profitable segments of the steel market coveted by all major integrated steelmakers wanting to maintain an edge over smaller minimills and reconstructed mills those spun off to employees
indeed <unk> said <unk> it expects the market for coated sheet steel to reach n million tons annually by <unk> compared with n million tons shipped in <unk>
for the first eight months of n analysts say n shipments of hot - dipped galvanized steel increased about <unk> from a year earlier while overall steel shipments were up only n
<unk> and <unk> <unk> hope to reach a definitive agreement establishing the <unk> partnership by the end of the year with construction tentatively slated for the spring of <unk> and production by <unk>
<unk> already has six lines in existing plants producing hot - dipped galvanized steel but this marks the first so - called greenfield plant for such production
moreover it will boost by <unk> <unk> current hot - dipped capacity of <unk> tons
the company said <unk> it does n't expect the new line capacity to adversely affect the company existing hot - dipped galvanizing lines
steelmakers have also been adding capacity of so - called electrogalvanized steel which is another way <unk> to make coated corrosion - resistant steel
one of the advantages of the hot - dipped process is that it allows the steel to be covered with a thicker coat of zinc more quickly
once you make up your mind about an investment the rest is easy right
you just call your broker and say buy or sell
dream on
there are all sorts of ways <unk> to give buy and sell instructions to a broker and just as many ways n to get burned if you do n't know what you doing
so here a rundown of the most common types of market orders permitted by the stock and commodity exchanges
two things n to keep in mind not all exchanges accept every type of order
and even when a specific order is acceptable to an exchange a brokerage firm can refuse to enter it for a customer
market order this is probably the most widely used order and the one most open to abuse by unscrupulous floor brokers since it imposes no price restrictions
with a market order an investor tells a broker to buy or sell at the market
it like saying get me in now or get me out now
for example if wheat is being offered at <unk> and bid at <unk> a market order to buy would be filled at the higher price and a market order to sell at the lower price
a recent indictment alleges that some floor brokers at the two largest <unk> commodity exchanges used market orders to fill customers orders at unfavorable prices by arranging trades with fellow brokers
profits realized from these trades would then be shared by the conspiring brokers
limit order limit orders are used when investors want to restrict the amount n they will receive or pay for an investment
investors do this by specifying a minimum price at which the investment may be sold or the maximum price that may be paid for it
suppose n an investor wants to sell a stock but not for less than n
a limit order to sell could be entered at that price
one risk investors may regret the restriction if the stock reaches n and then falls
unless the market goes at least one tick the smallest price increment permitted beyond the limit price investors are n't assured of having their orders filled because there may not be sufficient trading volume <unk> to permit filling it at the specified price
stop <unk> <unk> orders tell a floor broker to buy or sell an investment once the price reaches a certain level
once the price reaches that level a stop order turns into a market order and the order is filled at whatever price the broker can get
stop orders are sometimes called stop - loss orders because they are frequently used to protect profits or limit losses
while stop orders sound similar to limit orders there is a difference sell stops must be entered at a price below the current market price and buy stops above
in contrast sell limit orders must be placed above the market price and buy limit orders are placed below
the crash in <unk> n and last <unk> sell - off painfully taught some investors exactly what stop orders will and wo n't do
an investor who may have placed a stop - loss order at <unk> under a stock that was trading at <unk> a share on the <unk> before the crash was stunned to discover that the order was filled at <unk> when the stock opened at that price on <unk>
stop - <unk> <unk> stop - limit orders turn into limit orders when an investment trades at the price specified in the order
unlike stop orders which are filled at the market price when the stop price is hit stop - limit orders demand that the trades be made only at the specified price
if it ca n't be made at that price it does n't get filled
investors who wish to be out of a position without the risk of receiving a worse - than-expected price from a market order may use this type of order to specify the price at which the order must be filled
but if the market moves quickly enough it may be impossible for the broker to carry out the order because the investment has passed the specified price
market - if-touched order market - if-touched orders are like stop orders in that they become market orders if a specified price is reached
however unlike a buy - stop order a buy market - if-touched order is entered at a price below the current price while a sell market - if-touched order is entered at a price above it
as soon as the market trades at the specified price the floor broker will fill it at the best possible price
fill - <unk> order the fill - or-kill order is one of several associated with the timing of trades
it instructs a broker to buy or sell an investment at the specified price or better
but if the investment ca n't be bought or sold immediately the order is automatically canceled
<unk> <unk> who came in second in the stock division of the recently completed <unk> <unk> <unk> says n he uses fill - or-kill orders almost exclusively when trading options
i like to use them to feel out the market he says
if they do n't fill it immediately then i can start over at a new price or try again with the same price
not - <unk> order this is another timing order
it is a market order that allows floor brokers to take more time n to buy or sell an investment if they think n they can get a better price by waiting
not - held orders which are also known as disregard the tape orders are always done at the customer risk
one - <unk> order this is really two orders in one generally for the same security or commodity instructing floor brokers to fill whichever order they can first and then cancel the other order
in a fast - moving market it prevents an investor from getting stuck with having made two trades on the same security
specific - time order this type of order couples many of the orders described above with instructions that the order must be carried out at or by a certain time
on the close can be added to many types of orders
for example market - on-close orders must be filled during the last few minutes of trading for the day at a price that is within the official closing range of prices as determined by the exchange
stop - close-only orders are stop orders that only become active during the closing minutes of trading
day orders expire at the end of the day on which they are entered good - till-canceled orders have no expiration date
most brokers assume that all orders are day orders unless specified otherwise
on <unk> n <unk> some investors learned the consequences of entering good - til-canceled limit orders and then forgetting about them
they found <unk> they had bought stock from limit orders that they might have entered weeks or months earlier and had forgotten to cancel
it is always the responsibility of investors to keep track of the orders n they have placed
investors who change their mind about buying or selling after an order has been filled are usually stuck with the consequences
<unk> <unk> writes on the options and commodities markets for the <unk> <unk> <unk>
in <unk> up the risks of stock - market investments there probably no starting place better than beta
but investors better not ignore its limitations either
beta is a handy gauge that measures the volatility of a stock or stock mutual fund
for any given move in the overall market it suggests how steeply that particular issue might rise or fall
beta figures are widely available and easy n to interpret
the beta of the broad market typically defined as the <unk> <unk> <unk> index is always <unk>
so a stock with a beta of <unk> is half as volatile one at <unk> is n more volatile and so on
cautious investors should generally go with stocks that have low betas
go with high - beta stocks to get the biggest payoff from a bet on a bull market
remember though that beta also has important limitations
beta is only part of the risk in a stock says <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> emeritus professor who developed the measure
there is risk that is not associated with market moves and the beta does n't tell you the magnitude of that
in particular beta does n't measure the company and industry - specific risk associated with an individual stock
that business risk is very significant for an investor with only a few stocks but it virtually disappears in a large and well - diversified portfolio
beta is also a poor indicator of the risk in stock groups that march to their own drummer
in particular the prices of gold and other precious - metals stocks shoot up and down but the stocks tend to have low betas because their moves are not market - inspired
concern that investors could misinterpret such readings led the <unk> <unk> of <unk> investors to eliminate beta figures for precious - metals funds in the <unk> edition of its mutual - fund guide
our fear was n people would look just at the beta of a gold fund and say n here is an investment with very low risk says <unk> <unk> director of research for the <unk> - based group
in reality it very volatile but the movements are not because of market movements
ready to review the riskiness of your investment portfolio
first a pop quiz
when you think of the words risk and investment what the specific peril that comes to mind
pencils down
if you like most people you said <unk> it a holding that goes completely sour maybe a bond that defaults or a stock whose value disappears in a bankruptcy proceeding
people tend to see risk primarily on that one dimension says <unk> <unk> national director of personal financial planning for accountants <unk> <unk> <unk>
but therein lies another aspect of investment risk the hazard of shaping your portfolio to avoid one or more types of risk and being blind - sided by others
this is clearly not good news to all you people who sleep like babies every night lulled by visions of your money sitting risk - free in six - month cds
risk wears many disguises and investments that are low in one type of obvious risk can be distressingly high in other less obvious kinds
<unk> <unk> bonds for example are supersafe when it comes to returning money at maturity
but their value as investments can be decimated by inflation which erodes the purchasing power of bonds fixed - dollar interest payments
risk is also a function of time
when financial professionals measure risk mathematically they usually focus on the volatility of short - term returns
stocks are much riskier than <unk> bills for example because the range in performance from the best years to the worst is much wider
that is usually measured by the standard deviation or divergence of annual results from the average return over time
but investors who are preoccupied with short - term fluctuations may be paying too little attention to another big risk not generating enough money to meet long - term financial and life - style goals
for instance some investors have sworn off stocks since the <unk> market crash last <unk> debacle only reinforced those feelings
but the stock market despite some stomach - churning declines has far outperformed other securities over extended periods
by retreating to the apparent security of say money - market funds investors may not be earning enough investment return to pay for a comfortable retirement
that the biggest risk of all the risk of not meeting your objectives says <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> financial planner with <unk> <unk> services
as a result financial advisers say n they take several steps when evaluating the riskiness of clients portfolios
they estimate the return <unk> a person current portfolio is likely to generate over time along with a standard deviation that suggests how much the return will vary year by year
they try to figure out the long - term results n the person needs to meet major goals
and they eyeball types of risk that are not easily quantified
the portfolios of two hypothetical families one a couple at retirement age and another a two - income couple at age n illustrate several types of risk that investors need to consider
for instance the insured municipal bonds that dominate the older couple portfolio were probably selected in large part for their low repayment risk
but they expose the holders to a lot of inflation risk and interest - rate risk
the younger couple stockholdings involve more risk than a diversified stock portfolio because the bulk of the money is in a single issue
note that the younger couple portfolio has a higher expected annual return <unk> vs. n as calculated by <unk> <unk> <unk> which is the financial - planning affiliate of <unk> <unk>
that largely reflects the heavy stockholdings
but one price paid for the higher expected return is greater short - term volatility as reflected in the higher standard deviation that seidman estimates for the younger couple portfolio
here how to interpret a standard deviation figure take the expected return and add one standard deviation to it
then take the expected return and subtract one standard deviation
in two of three years the actual result should fall within that range if all the assumptions were accurate
then add and subtract two standard deviations to get a wider range
there a n probability n any year result will fall in the range
of course the greater volatility of the younger couple portfolio does n't necessarily mean <unk> those investments are riskier in terms of meeting the holders long - term goals
indeed the older couple portfolio could actually be riskier in that sense if the expected return wo n't generate enough dollars to meet their spending plans
they may feel emotionally secure now because they are not heavily in the stock market says <unk> <unk> <unk> a financial planner with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>
but they may pay a price <unk> or n years in the future
<unk> <unk> reports on personal finance from the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> bureau
when it comes to investing trying to weigh risk and reward can seem like throwing darts blindfolded investors do n't know the actual returns that securities will deliver or the ups and downs that will occur along the way
looking to the past can provide some clues
over several decades for instance investors who put up with the stock market gyrations earned returns far in excess of those on bonds and cash investments like <unk> bills
but while history can suggest what is reasonable n to expect there no guarantee that the past will repeat itself
for instance some analysts believe n bond returns and volatility have moved permanently closer to those of the stock market
and returns on cash investments may continue to exceed inflation by a wider margin than they did over the long - term past

a letter from <unk> <unk> <unk> chides us today for implying that he had flip - flopped on <unk> <unk>
he correctly says <unk> he has been down on <unk> for some time hence his criticism of administration mishandling of the attempted coup
our <unk> n editorial should have been more precise
it meant to convey our hope that the <unk> and other members of the congressional left are broadening their dislike of noriega to include other notorious central american drug runners
the sandinistas of <unk> for example also are part of the <unk> - <unk> cartel nexus
in his letter and on the basis of his losing vote <unk> against <unk> aid for the nicaraguan opposition <unk> <unk> makes clear <unk> he has not made that intellectual leap
we were wrong
<unk> <unk> <unk> investors have been looking for creative alternatives to traditional modes of financial planning
capital has been democratized and people want in
too often however small investors are left with the same stale solutions that appealed to previous generations of fiduciary strategists
now a startling new approach is available to building your financial portfolio without undue risk without extensive planning and without hurting your life style one bit
this is particularly good news for those who hate risk who are incapable of doing extensive amounts of planning and who refuse to see their life styles hurt in any way
you know who you are
my revolutionary system is also useful for those who have tried customary forms of growing their currency cushion
like all americans seeking chronic prosperity i do find it necessary to plunge certain funds into conservative monetary tools if only to assuage my father - in-law who believes in such things
so throughout the decade i have maintained my share of individual retirement accounts and cds and tinkered with stocks bonds and mutual funds as well as preserving my necessary position in the residential real - estate market
return on this fine portfolio has been modest when it has not been negative
figure n demonstrates the performance of those businesses n i invested in during this prosperous decade see accompanying illustration <unk> <unk> n <unk>
oil - related properties suffered a huge decline until i divested myself of all such stocks in <unk> at which point the industry while not lighting up any <unk> trees began a slow recovery
likewise mutual funds remained relatively flat until i made what was for me a serious investment
by <unk> these properties were in a tailspin causing my broker at <unk> - <unk> to remark that she never seen anything like it
concerned for her state of mind i dropped them and the market instantly began its steady climb back to health
perhaps most dramatic was the performance of the metropolitan <unk> <unk> real - estate market which was booming until i entered it in late n at which time it posted the first negative compound annual growth rate in years
disgusted i cast around for a different way n to plan my asset distribution and with hardly any heavy breathing the answer struck me i was doing it already
we all got money n to spend some of it clearly disposable since we keep disposing of it
bank it
not really
sock it away in long - term instruments
nonsense
<unk> living is the best possible investment
your priorities may be different but here in <unk> <unk> is where i chosen to build for the future personal space automotive pursuits children toys gardening equipment bulbs and shrubs and finally entertainment perhaps the best investment of all
all have paid off for me in double - digit annual growth and continue to provide significant potential
at least according to my calculations
personal space figure n has grown <unk> annually over the course of the decade a performance that would compare positively with an investment in say synthetic - leather products for the interiors of cold - weather vehicles which my cousin got into and sort of regrets to this day
the assortment of expensive children toys that i have purchased wisely at a host of discount - toy brokerage firms <unk> <unk> has increased handsomely in total asset value far beyond any personal investment except perhaps for my record collection whose worth i think n it safe to say is incalculable
continued investment in my n subcompact has been part of my strategy <unk> <unk> with present annual contributions now equaling more than n of the car original value
according to my calculations these outlays should have brought the value of my sedan to more than <unk> on the open market figure n where i plan to offer it shortly
expansion of my living space has produced an obvious need for maintenance and construction of suitable lawns shrubs and bushes fitting to its suburban locale
i have thus committed sufficient personal outlay to ensure that my grounds and lodgings will never be short of greens and flowers
my initial stake in this blooming enterprise has grown tenfold according to my conservative calculations
at the same time my share in a wide variety of entertainment pursuits has given perhaps the most dramatic demonstration of the benefits of creative personal financial planning
over the course of the decade for instance my return on investment in the area of poker alone figures <unk> and <unk> has been most impressive showing bodacious annual expansion with given the way n my associates play no sign of abatement into the n and beyond
with this personal strategy firmly in place i look forward to years of fine life - style investments and increasing widespread leverage
my kids college education looms as perhaps the greatest future opportunity for spending although i probably have to cash in their toy portfolio to take advantage of it
but with every step <unk> i take i building wealth
you can too if you like me refuse to bite the bullet
so go out there and eat that debt
you right there in the mainstream of american business building value on the back of insupportable expenditures
<unk> <unk> watch out
<unk> <unk> is a business executive and writer in <unk> <unk>
when <unk> <unk> was just a lad his father gave him a piece of career advice
he told me to choose an area where just by being mediocre i could be great recalls <unk> <unk> now n
he tried management consulting traded in turquoise for a while and even managed professional wrestlers
now he has settled into a career that fits the bill financial planning
it should be noted that <unk> <unk> who operates out of <unk> <unk> is a puckish sort who likes to give his colleagues the needle
but in this case the needle has a very sharp point
though it probably safe to assume that the majority of financial planners are honest and even reasonably competent the fact remains that as one wag puts it anybody who can fog a mirror can call himself a financial planner
planners now influence the investment of several hundred billion dollars but in effect they operate in the dark
there is no effective regulation of planners no accepted standard for admission into their ranks a dog got into one trade group no way n to assess their performance no way even n to know how many of them there are estimates range from <unk> to n
all n anyone need do is hang up a shingle and start planning
so it should come as no shock that the profession if that what it is has attracted a lot of people whose principal talents seem to be frittering away or flat - out stealing their clients money
alarmed state and federal authorities are trying to devise ways <unk> to certify and regulate planners
industry groups and reputable planners who are members of them want comprehensive standards too they tired of seeing practitioners depicted collectively in the business press as dumber than chimpanzees and greedier than a herd of swine
but reform has n't taken hold yet
the industry is still pretty much in its <unk> <unk> days says <unk> <unk> director of investor education for the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
an admittedly limited survey by <unk> whose members are state securities - law regulators found that between <unk> and <unk> fraud and abuse by financial planners cost n investors n million
the rogues gallery of planners involved includes some convicted felons a compulsive gambler or two various businessmen who had planned their own previous ventures right into bankruptcy and one man who scammed his wife grandmother
what more the losses n they and the others caused are just what we are stumbling over says <unk> <unk> <unk> adding that the majority of misdeeds probably go undetected
so do just about all the losses that could be attributed to the sheer incompetence of unqualified planners
nobody can estimate the toll but <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> planner and head of one trade group the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> thinks <unk> the danger to investors from incompetence is humongous far greater than that from crookery
his group like others wants minimum standards applied to all who call themselves financial planners
surveying all this some people now think n the best planner might be no planner at all
for most investors the benefits just are n't worth the risks says <unk> <unk> <unk> who follows financial - planning issues for the <unk> <unk> of <unk> a consumer - advocacy organization based in <unk>
she concedes that such a position is unfair to the thousands of conscientious and qualified people plying the trade but as a consumer advocate she feels impelled to take it
she says <unk> her group used to give tips on selecting planners check educational and experience credentials consult regulators and <unk> <unk> bureaus but found that even some people who took these steps were still getting ripped off
the bad news however has n't been bad enough to kill the growing demand for financial planning
the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> which eliminated many tax shelters peddled by planners and the stock market crash the next year did cause a sharp slump in such demand and many planners had to make an unplanned exit from the business
but membership in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> the industry biggest trade group is still nearly triple what it was in <unk> and it believed that the ranks of planners who do n't belong to any group have soared as well
an estimated n million americans are now using financial planners and the pool of capital <unk> they influence is enormous
a survey of <unk> of them conducted by the <unk> in <unk> showed that these practitioners alone had controlled or guided the investment of <unk> billion of their clients money in the previous <unk> months
the sheer number of planners makes the business extremely difficult if not impossible n to regulate
even the minority of them who must register with the securities and <unk> <unk> as investment advisers people who are in the business of counseling others on the buying and selling of securities specifically have been enough to swamp the agency capacity
the <unk> has only about n staffers assigned to keep tabs on investment advisers about the same as in <unk> even though the number of advisers has tripled to about n over the past decade
currently a registered investment adviser can expect an <unk> audit only once every n years
a lot of bad things can happen in n years
it does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out our problem says <unk> <unk> director of the <unk> division of investment management
so the <unk> has proposed to <unk> that much of the job of oversight be turned over to an industry - funded self - regulatory organization patterned on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> which operates in the brokerage business
such an organization could among other things set minimum standards for competence ethics and finances and punish those investment advisers who broke the rules
the proposal has set off a lively debate within an industry that was far from united to begin with
<unk> <unk> the puckish planner from <unk> <unk> says that allowing the business to police itself would be like putting <unk> in charge of the blood bank
<unk> <unk> the <unk> planner who heads one trade group favors simply assessing the industry and giving the money to the <unk> to hire more staff
<unk> <unk> views are not greeted with wild enthusiasm over at the <unk> the major industry organization
when the <unk> recently assembled other industry groups to discuss common standards that might be applied to planners <unk> <unk> group was excluded
that may be because <unk> <unk> smarting at what he considered slurs on his membership standards made by the rival group enrolled his dog <unk> as a member of the <unk>
then he sent the pooch picture with the certificate of membership it was made out to <unk> <unk> <unk> to every newspaper n he could think of
the states have their own ideas about regulation and certification
<unk> the organization of state securities regulators is pushing for a model regulatory statute already adopted in eight states
it requires financial planners to register with states pass competency tests and reveal to customers any conflicts of interest
the most common conflict involves compensation
<unk> estimates that nearly n of planners receive some or all of their income from sales commissions on securities insurance and other financial products n they recommend
the issue is the planner putting his clients into the best investments or the ones that garner the biggest commissions
in <unk> the <unk> <unk> attorney general office got an order from a state court in <unk> shutting down <unk> <unk> <unk> an <unk> financial - planning firm that had invested n million on behalf of nearly n investors
in its notice of action the attorney general said <unk> the company had promised to put clients into balanced investment portfolios instead the attorney general alleged <unk> the company consistently shoved unwary customers into high - risk investments in paintings coins and <unk> condos
those investments paid big commissions to <unk> <unk> payments n investors were never told about the attorney general alleged <unk>
investors were further assured that only those with a minimun net worth would be accepted
in practice the attorney general alleged <unk> in an affidavit if an investor had access to cash the chances of being turned down by <unk> <unk> were about as probable as being rejected by the <unk> - <unk> <unk>
and the attorney general added <unk> <unk> <unk> president <unk> <unk> <unk> portrayed himself as a financial expert when his qualifications largely consisted of a high - school diploma work as a real - estate and insurance salesman and a stint as supervisor at a highway toll booth
<unk> <unk> and its officials are currently under investigation for possible criminal wrongdoing according to a spokeswoman for the attorney general
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> attorney says <unk> his client denies any wrongdoing and adds that the attorney general contentions about <unk> <unk> business practices are incorrect
as for <unk> <unk> qualifications the snooty attorneys for the state of <unk> <unk> decided <unk> <unk> <unk> was n't qualified because he did n't have a <unk> degree says <unk> <unk>
civil suits against planners by clients seeking recovery of funds are increasingly common
two such actions both filed earlier this year in <unk> state court in <unk> could be particularly embarrassing to the industry both name <unk> <unk> <unk> an <unk> financial planner who is a founder and past chairman of the <unk> as defendant
one suit filed by more than three dozen investors charges that <unk> <unk> misused much of the n million put into a limited partnership that he operated and promoted spending some of it to pay his own legal bills and to invest in other companies in which he had an interest
those companies in turn paid <unk> <unk> commissions and fees the suit alleges n
the other suit was filed by two men in a dispute over <unk> investments n each says n he made with <unk> <unk> as part of an effort to purchase the <unk> of <unk> in <unk> <unk>
one plaintiff a doctor testified in an affidavit that he also gave <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to join a sort of investment club which essentially gave the physician the privilege of making additional investments with <unk> <unk>
in affidavits each plaintiff claims <unk> <unk> <unk> promised n the bank purchase would be completed by the end of <unk> or the money returned
<unk> <unk> took the plaintiffs and other investors money to a meeting of the bank directors
wearing a business suit and western - style hat and boots he opened up his briefcase and dumped n million in cash on a table in front of the directors says <unk> <unk> <unk> the bank president
he said n he wanted to show the color of his money recalls <unk> <unk>
bank officials however showed him the door and the sale never came off
according to the suit <unk> <unk> has yet to return the plaintiffs investment
they want it back
<unk> <unk> declines to comment on specific allegations in the two suits saying n he prefers to save such responses for court
but he does say that all of his activities have been entirely proper
on the suit by the limited partners he says n he is considering a defamation suit against the plaintiffs
the suit he adds n is almost in the nature of a vendetta by a handful of disgruntled people
rearding the suit over the bank bid <unk> <unk> says n it is filled with inflammatory language and half truths
he declines to go into specifics
<unk> <unk> says <unk> the suits against him are less a measure of his work than they are a sign of the times in which people generally are more prone to sue
i do n't know anybody in the industry who has n't experienced litigation he says
<unk> <unk> also says n he does n't consider himself a financial planner anymore
he now calls himself an investment banker
in many scams or alleged scams involving planners it plain that only a modicum of common sense on the part of the investors would have kept them out of harm way
using it would n't a proessional hesitate to pay tens of thousands of dollars just for a chance to invest witha planner
other cases go to show that an old saw still applies if it sounds too good n to be true it probably is
certificates of deposit do n't pay <unk> a year for example but that did n't give pause to clients of one <unk> planner
now they losers and he in jail in <unk> <unk>
cds yielding n are even more implausible especially when the issuing bank in the <unk> <unk> is merely a mail drop watched over by a local gas - station operator but investors fell for that one too
and the <unk> planner who promised to make some of his clients millionaires on investments of as litle as <unk>
never mind
you already know the answer
<unk> <unk> is a staff reporter in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> bureau
at the ritzy <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the tanned and elegant ladies of this wealthy <unk> <unk> beach community disembark from their mercedes - benzes and bmws for another day of exercising their credit cards
they root among the designer offerings at <unk> - <unk> and <unk> <unk>
they stroll through the marble - encased corridors of the <unk> <unk>
they graze at the <unk> <unk> a combination gourmet food court and grocery store while a pianist accompanies the noon fashion show with a selection of dreamy melodies
the beautiful look of wool croons the show narrator slightly victorian in its influence
meanwhile in the squat office buildings that ring <unk> <unk> the odds are good that someone is getting fleeced
law - enforcement authorities say that at any given time a host of fraudulent telemarketing operations mingle with the many legitimate businesses here
they seem to like these industrial parks says <unk> <unk> a postal inspector who specializes in mail fraud
we call them fraud farms
welcome to that welter of contradictions known as <unk> <unk>
this city of more than <unk> is known for sunshine yachts and rich residents
it is also known as the fraud capital of the <unk> dubbed by investigators and the media as the <unk> de <unk>
how does a community famous for its high living end up as a haven for low - lifes
clearly the existence of the former lures the latter
the places renowned for breeding bunco like the <unk> neighborhood known as the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> flashy strip of casinos invariably offer fast cars high rollers glamorous women and lots of sunshine
you do n't hear much about unusual concentrations of fraud in <unk> <unk> or <unk>
con men hate snow
<unk> <unk> fits the scam artists specifications perfectly
what more could a con man in search of the easy life ask for
nothing seems hard here
the breezes are soft the waves lap gently and the palm trees sway lazily
<unk> is plentiful
moreover ostentation is appreciated
the median price of homes is n more than n vessels fill what the chamber of commerce calls the nation largest pleasure - boat harbor
blondes cocaine and corvettes mutters <unk> <unk>
that what they after
the rich image of <unk> <unk> also helps lend the con artists operation an air of respectability
one reason n they use <unk> <unk> is that it sounds swankier than most addresses says <unk> <unk> a <unk> attorney who until recently headed a multi - agency <unk> <unk> fraud task force
<unk> <unk> is known in <unk> <unk> for having a lot of rich people
no wonder n all kinds of big - time scams have flourished here from phony tax - sheltered <unk> sales to crooked car dealers to bogus penny - stock traders
but above all this is the national headquarters for boiler - room operators those slick - talking snake - oil salesmen who use the telephone to extract money from the gullible and the greedy and then vanish
because only a fraction of them are ever prosecuted nobody really knows how much money bogus telemarketing operators really harvest
i heard that there is n billion taken in nationwide by boiler rooms every year <unk> <unk> says
if that true <unk> <unk> has to be at least n of that
and most of the truly big scams in <unk> <unk> seem to originate in <unk> <unk> or one of the other well - heeled communities that surround this sliver - like city that hooks around a point of land on the <unk> coast south of <unk> <unk>
in fact sophisticated big - bucks boiler - room scams are known generically among law - enforcement types as <unk> <unk> operations
that contrasts with the penny - ante sales of things such as pen - and-pencil sets and office supplies that are known as <unk> scams
<unk> <unk> telemarketers concentrate on precious metals and oil - leasing deals that typically cost thousands of dollars a shot
the investors range from elderly widows to affluent professionals
in one ingenious recent example of a <unk> <unk> boiler room prospective investors in <unk> <unk> <unk> were allegedly told that their investment in precious metals was insured against losses caused by employees due to dishonesty destruction or disappearance according to an indictment handed up by a federal grand jury in <unk> <unk> last month
thus falsely reassured investors sent n million to the <unk> <unk> company most of which was diverted to unauthorized uses the indictment charges n
<unk> <unk> an attorney representing <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . the chairman and president of <unk> <unk> says <unk> his client denies that there was any attempt to defraud investors
there were some business deals that went bad <unk> <unk> says but no intent to defraud
<unk> <unk> operations differ from the <unk> boiler rooms in style as well as in dollars
traditionally boiler rooms operate on the cheap since few if any customers ever visit their offices
indeed the name derives from the tendency among telemarketing scammers to rent cheap basement space near the boiler room
but says <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> attorney the interesting thing about <unk> <unk> operations is that they give themselves the indulgence of beautiful offices with plush furnishings
when we go there it quite different from these <unk> places where the sandwiches are spread out on the table and the people are picking their noses
the <unk> <unk> operators also tend to indulge themselves privately
investigators cite the case of <unk> <unk> who is currently serving a six - year sentence at <unk> <unk> <unk> for his role in <unk> <unk> <unk> which promised investors returns of as much as <unk> on precious metals
<unk> <unk> who pleaded guilty to five counts of fraud in federal court in <unk> <unk> drove a leased <unk> and lived in an expensive home on <unk> <unk> an island in <unk> harbor according to investigators
with the n million received from investors he took frequent junkets with friends to exotic locales and leased an expensive <unk> for his girlfriend whom he met at the shop where he got his custom - tailored suits
it amazing the amount of money that goes up their nose out to the dog track or to the tables in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> says
all this talk of boiler rooms and fraud is unnerving to the city legitimate business element
<unk> <unk> <unk> regional manager of <unk> <unk> <unk> insists <unk> he does n't know of any bogus telemarketers operating in the n million square feet of office space around <unk> <unk> that his company leases for <unk> <unk> the owner and developer of the project
<unk> <unk> has rejected a few prospective tenants who provided incomplete financial information and acknowledges that illegitimate operators are not easily detectable
investigators stress that building owners are victims too since boiler rooms often leave without paying rent
<unk> <unk> president of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> calls boiler rooms a negative n we wish <unk> we could get rid of
actually we do n't get much negative publicity about this he insists <unk> except for the press who write about it
<unk> <unk> is deputy chief of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> bureau
you went to college and thought n you got an education
now you discover that you never learned the most important lesson how to send your kids to college
true when you went to college there was n't that much n to learn
stick some money in an interest - bearing account and watch it grow
now investment salesmen say n it time n to take some risks if you want the kind of returns that will buy your toddler a ticket to <unk> <unk> in <unk> years
in short throw away the passbook and go for the glory
the reason is cost
nothing in the annals of tuition readied parents for the <unk>
tuitions at private colleges rose n in the <unk> years ended in <unk> of this year that twice the n increase in consumer prices for the same period
a year at <unk> now goes for <unk>
by n when this year newborns hit campus a four - year <unk> <unk> sheepskin will cost n give or take a few pizzas - with-everything at exam time
<unk> <unk> and other utmosts will cost no less
so what a parent to do
some investment advisers are suggesting in effect a bet on a start - up investment pool maybe even on margin
others prefer deep - discount zero - coupon bonds
still others say why not take a chance on a high - octane growth fund
you not going to make it in a <unk> bank account says <unk> <unk> director of mutual funds at <unk> <unk> <unk>
to get the necessary growth adds <unk> <unk> <unk> a marketing official at the <unk> <unk> mutual - fund group you need to go to the stock market
in other words a little volatility never hurt
it never hurt anyone that is unless the growth funds do n't grow when you need them to
or the zero - coupon bonds turn out not to have been discounted deeply enough to pay your kid tuition
that the dilemma for today parent
although many experts are advising risk no one has a good answer for you if the risk does n't pay off
help may be on the way
the antitrust division of the <unk> <unk> is investigating the oddly similar tuition charges and increases among the top schools
fear of the price police could help cool things off in the n
and then there always <unk> <unk>
but parents craving for a top - rated education for their children is growing like their taste for fancy wheels and vintage wine
belatedly aware of public concern lawmakers and financial middlemen are working overtime to create and sell college savings and investment schemes
their message explicit or implicit is that a good college will cost so much by whenever you want it that the tried and true wo n't do anymore
forget about <unk> bills or a money - market fund
the latest wave of marketing is instructive
several outfits including the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> mutual - fund groups and the <unk> <unk> <unk> brokerage house are advertising college planner tables and charts that tell you how much you need to put aside regularly
the calculations generally rely on an after - tax rate of return of <unk> annually a rate historically obtainable by the individual in only one place the stock market
most of the mailers are free but <unk> - based <unk> <unk> sells for <unk> a version customized to the age of the child and the college of choice
the figures are shocking
to build a nest egg that would pay for <unk> when a current first - grader reaches college age parents would need to set aside <unk> a month for n years
they can cut this to <unk> a month if the investing keeps up through college
and they can further reduce the monthly amount if they start saving earlier when mother and child come home from the hospital
plugging a cheaper college into the formulas still does n't generate an installment n most people can live with
using a recent average private - school cost of about <unk> a year <unk> <unk> <unk> planner prescribes n monthly if the plan begins when the child is six
since the formula assumes an n before - tax return in a mutual fund there would also be n in taxes n to pay over the n years
not everyone is so pessimistic
people are basically peddling a lot of fear says <unk> <unk> a consultant to the <unk> <unk> on <unk> in <unk>
he takes issue with projections that do n't factor in students own contribution which reduces most parents burden substantially
still he says n it no bad thing if all the marketing prods people into putting aside a little more
the situation n you want to avoid is having somebody not save anything and hope <unk> they be able to do it out of current income he says
that crazy
his advice do n't panic
parents he says n should aim at whatever regular investment sum they can afford
half the amount that the investment tables suggest might be a good goal he adds n
that way parents will reduce borrowings and outlays from current income when the time comes <unk> to pay tuition
<unk> <unk> reckons that the best investment choice is mutual funds because they are managed and over time have nearly kept up with the broad stock averages
he favors either an all - stock fund or a balanced fund that mixes both stocks and bonds
in their anxiety however parents and other student benefactors are flocking to new schemes
they have laid out about n billion for so - called baccalaureate zero - coupon municipal bonds so far offered by <unk> <unk> <unk> and eight other states
and they have bought about <unk> million in prepaid - tuition plans offered in <unk> <unk> and <unk>
the prepaid plans take payment today usually at current tuitions or at a slight discount for a promise that tuition will be covered tomorrow
the baccalaureate bonds tax - free offered in small denominations and usually containing a provision that they wo n't be called before maturity seem to be tailor - made for college savers
like other zeros they pay all their interest at maturity meaning that buyers can time things so that their bonds pay off just when <unk> graduates from high school
their compounding effect is also alluring
in <unk> <unk> sold bonds for n that will pay <unk> in <unk>
but <unk> <unk> head of the <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> at <unk> <unk> a research group partly financed by the federal government says <unk> zeros are particularly ill - suited
their price falls further than that of other bonds when inflation and interest rates kick up
that wo n't matter if they are held to maturity but if for any reason the parents need to sell them before then there could be a severe loss of principal
had zeros been available in <unk> and had parents bought a face amount equal to four years tuition at the time aiming for their children n enrollment they would have been left with only enough to pay for two years <unk> <unk> figures <unk>
most other bonds however would probably not have fared much better
the prepaid plans may be a good bet provided <unk> the guarantee of future tuition is secure
issuing states generally limit the guarantees to in - state institutions however and buyers get refunds without much interest if the children do n't attend the specified schools
two private groups are seeking <unk> and <unk> <unk> approval for plans that could be more broadly transferable
<unk> <unk> wants the prestige colleges to sponsor such a plan
the issue here may be the soundness of the guarantee
prepayments much like mutual - fund purchases are pooled for investment
sponsors are naturally counting on their ability to keep ahead of tuition inflation with investment returns
but buyers are essentially betting on a start - up investment fund with no track record and some have been encouraged to borrow to do so
one problem is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> has decided that the investment earnings and gains of the sponsors funds are taxable
the colleges as educational institutions had hoped n that would n't be the case
based on historical rates of return <unk> <unk> reckons n a n stock portfolio indexed to the market would have kept up with tuition and taxes in the <unk> century
but sponsors might not pick the stocks that will match the market
and they leaning more toward fixed income whose returns after tax have trailed tuition increases
i not sure n they going to make it work says <unk> <unk>
what happens if the sponsors do n't have the cash n to pay the tuitions
<unk> and <unk> have backed up their guarantees with the full faith and credit of the state governments meaning that taxpayers will pick up any slack
not so <unk>
its plan is set up as an independent agency
the state says n there no worry investment returns combined with fees and the gains from unused plans will provide all the cash n it needs
<unk> <unk> covers education from the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> bureau
if you start saving for your child eduction on <unk> n <unk> here the monthly sum n you will need to invest to pay for four years at <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
figures assume a <unk> annual rise in tuition fees room and board and an n annual investment return
note these figures are only for mandatory charges and do n't include books transportation etc

source <unk> <unk>
among the catfish farmers in the watery delta land of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> was one of the best known and most enterprising
he sold quarter - inch fingerlings n to stock other farmers ponds and he bought back one - pound-or-so food - fish that he live - hauled to market along with his own whiskery crop
and he nearly always bought and sold for cash
along the way <unk> <unk> omitted a total of n million from his receipts reported on federal tax returns for three years
the returns landed in the hands of an <unk> <unk> <unk> criminal investigator <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> interviewed or wrote to hundreds of catfish farmers live - haulers and processors throughout the <unk> before coming up with detailed estimates of purchases and sales in pounds and dollars by <unk> <unk> and others
unknown to <unk> <unk> he had fouled his net on a special <unk> project n to catch catfish farmers and haulers inclined to cheat on their taxes
confronted with the evidence <unk> <unk> pleaded guilty to one charge of filing a false return and was fined <unk> and sentenced to n months in prison
he also owes a lot of back taxes interest and civil fraud penalties
a lot of taxpayers out there are n't as paranoid as one might think n
federal and state tax enforcers develop many group targets for investigation on the basis of occupation high income type of income or some other characteristic that may signal an opportunity or tendency to hide income or exaggerate deductions
many professions long have seemed to be targets because of the exotic or ludicrous efforts of some members to offset high income with fake losses from phony tax shelters dentists who invested in dubiously dubbed foreign films or airline pilots who raised racehorses on their days off
mail - order ministers have been squelched
now television and radio evangelists are under scrutiny
the <unk> recently won part of its long - running battle with the <unk> of <unk> over exemptions when the <unk> <unk> <unk> held that members payments to the church were n't deductible because the members received services in return
<unk> statistics show that the more persistent hiders of income among sole proprietors of businesses include used - car dealers entertainment producers masons roofers and taxi owners
small businesses in general account for almost n of unreported personal income the <unk> has said n
once such abuses become so pervasive the <unk> builds another factor into its secret computer formula for selecting returns for audit and does n't need special projects for them
<unk> franciscans have a much higher incidence of audits than average because more of them score high under that formula not because <unk> agents envy their life styles
many openings for mass cheating such as questionable tax shelters and home offices have gaped so broadly that <unk> has passed stringent laws to close them
deductions of charitable gifts of highly valued art now must be accompanied by appraisals
and laws requiring the reporting of more varieties of transactions have enabled the <unk> to rely on computers to ferret out discrepancies with returns and to generate form - letter inquiries to taxpayers
unreported alimony income can be spotted by computer because a payer of alimony who gets a deduction must report the former spouse <unk> <unk> number
passport applicants now must give <unk> <unk> numbers enabling the <unk> to see whether americans living abroad are filing required <unk> returns
but while <unk> computers focus routinely on target groups like these the agency has assigned many agents to special projects that need more personal attention
in most cases the <unk> says n these projects are local or regional rather than national and arise because auditors in an area detect some pattern of abuse among say factory workers claiming that having a multitude of dependents frees them from tax withholding or yacht owners deducting losses from sideline charter businesses
the national office currently has n noncriminal audit projects according to <unk> <unk> <unk> deputy assistant commissioner for examination
auditors involved in noncriminal projects ca n't send anyone to jail but they can make life miserable in other ways for one by imposing some of the <unk> different civil penalties for negligence failure to file a return and the like
the targeted audit groups include direct sellers people who sell cosmetics housewares and other items door to door or at home parties and employers who label workers as independent contractors instead of employees to avoid the employer share of payroll taxes
other projects look for offenders among waiters who get cash tips people who engage in large cash transactions and people whose returns show <unk> they sold a home for a profit without reinvesting the capital gain in another home by the end of the same year the gain must be rolled over within two years to defer tax
and now that returns must show dependents <unk> <unk> numbers the <unk> wants to see which dependents show up on more than one return and which dependents turn out to be deceased
impetus for the direct - seller project came from a congressional hearing some years back
it prompted an <unk> study that found n many sellers were concealing income and treating large amounts of nondeductible travel and other personal expenses as business costs <unk> <unk> says n
the study provided criteria for singling out returns of potentially noncompliant taxpayers who report low income and large expenses from a part - time business
the <unk> <unk> recently denied business deductions by <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> who both were part - time distributors of <unk> products in addition to their regular jobs as sales people in other fields
for <unk> they reported gross income of <unk> from <unk> sales offset by expenses totaling n including car costs of <unk> and travel and entertainment costs of n
the <unk> <unk> did n't believe that the rubins who earned n in their regular jobs treated the sideline as a real business and derived merely incidental elements of recreation and other personal pleasure and benefits from it
the <unk> <unk> <unk> a trade group points out that its members which include <unk> <unk> cooperate with the <unk> to distribute tax - compliance material to sales people and are helping to prepare a public - service television program on the subject
the independent - contractor project which began in n involves about n <unk> agents
in the fiscal nine months ended <unk> <unk> reports <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> assistant commissioner for collection they examined about <unk> employers assessed more than n million in delinquent employment taxes and reclassified about <unk> workers as employees instead of self - employed contractors
the number of misclassified workers may be in the millions mostly paid by small firms
many workers especially professionals want to remain independent to avoid tax withholding and to continue to deduct many expenses that employees ca n't
but many others who want to qualify for employee benefits and unemployment compensation become tipsters for the <unk> says <unk> <unk> <unk> who manages the <unk> project force of nine agents in north and central <unk> from <unk>
firms that are paying employment taxes also provide leads to competitors that are n't he says n
in his area <unk> <unk> continues <unk> the miscreant employers most commonly are in construction doing framing drywall masonry and similar work
but a medical clinic with about n employees wrongly listed all of them including physicians and receptionists as independent contractors
the <unk> assessed the clinic n in back payroll taxes
it assessed nearly n against a cruise - ship company that carried about n deckhands cooks bartenders entertainers and other employees as self - employed independents
revenue - short states also are becoming more aggressive pursuers of tax delinquents and perhaps none tracks them down with more relish than does <unk> <unk> since it acquired an n million computer system in <unk>
the state tax enforcers have amassed data bases from other <unk> <unk> agencies that license or register professionals and businesses from exchange agreements with the <unk> <unk> other states and two canadian provinces and even from phonebook <unk> <unk>
thus armed for massive matching of documents by computer they single out high - income groups looking primarily for people who have n't filed <unk> <unk> income - tax returns
the state has combed through records relating to architects stockbrokers lawyers in the <unk> <unk> <unk> area construction workers from out of the state and homeowners who claim to be residents of other states especially <unk> which has no personal income tax
soon to feel the glare of attention are lawyers elsewhere in the state doctors dentists and accountants says <unk> <unk> <unk> director of the tax - department division that develops the computer - matching programs
the department has collected over n million from brokers so far and recommended more than <unk> of them for criminal prosecution
in the early stage of checking people with incomes exceeding n who were filing nonresident returns it squeezed n million out of a man who was posing as a <unk> resident
we think n we can reclaim hundreds of millions of dollars just through the nonresident project <unk> <unk> declares
<unk> <unk> is editor of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> column
in finding good news in <unk> new freshman admissions plan the <unk> <unk> editorial <unk> n you reading the headline but not the story
the plan indeed raises from <unk> to n the number of freshmen applicants admitted strictly by academic criteria
but that does n't mean <unk> half of the students attending <unk> will be admitted this way
the plan is talking about applicants admitted not students who enroll
since the yield from this top slice of applicants is relatively low boosting admits from <unk> to <unk> will boost registrants from about <unk> to n of the class
in addition perhaps n of registrants will come from a new category consisting of applicants whose academic credentials narrowly missed gaining them admission in the first category
but against that combined increase of n in students chosen by academic criteria the plan eliminates a large category in which admissions now are based on grades test scores and supplemental points for factors such as high - school curriculum <unk> - language proficiency and an essay
this category now accounts for about <unk> of admits and n of registrants
the plan thus will decrease by <unk> for a net loss of n the number of students admitted primarily by academic criteria
who will take over these places
the plan creates a new category of students from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds a concept not yet defined and gives them about <unk> of the class
one of the plan authors has defended the socioeconomic disadvantage category as perhaps making more sense than the current affirmative - action preferences based on race
perhaps it does
but the new category does not replace or reduce <unk> broad racial preferences
nor will students from racial - minority groups who are admitted through the new category be counted against the affirmative - action target for their group
the plan thus places a large new affirmative - action program based on socioeconomic disadvantage on top of the existing program based on race
the role of academic criteria in choosing <unk> freshmen can only decline as a result
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>
for those who delight in the misfortune of others read on
this is a story about suckers
most of us know a sucker
many of us are suckers
but what we may not know is just what makes somebody a sucker
what makes people blurt out their credit - card numbers to a caller n they never heard of
do they really believe that the number is just for verification and is simply a formality on the road to being a grand - prize winner
what makes a person buy an oil well from some stranger knocking on the screen door
or an interest in a retirement community in <unk> that will knock your socks off once it is built
because in the end these people always wind up asking themselves the same question how could i be so stupid
there are unfortunately plenty of answers to that question and scam artists know all of them
these people are very skilled at finding out what makes a person tick says <unk> <unk> chief of the economic - crime unit of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> a major haven for boiler rooms
once they size them up then they know what buttons to push
<unk> <unk> agrees and he ought to know
he used to be a boiler - room salesman peddling investments in oil and gas wells and rare coins
there a definite psychology of the sale and different personalities n you pitch different ways he says
the most obvious pitch of course is the lure of big returns
we all a little greedy
everyone is vulnerable says <unk> <unk> associate regional administrator for the securities and <unk> <unk> in <unk>
these guys prey on human frailties
while the promises of big profits ought to set off warning bells they often do n't in part because get - rich-quick tales have become embedded in american folklore
the overnight success story is part of our culture and our society puts an emphasis on it with lotteries and <unk> <unk> making millionaires out of people says <unk> <unk> an associate professor of psychology at the <unk> of <unk> in <unk>
other people are making it overnight and the rest who toil daily do n't want to miss that opportunity when it seems to come along
adds <unk> <unk> branch chief for enforcement at the <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> why do people play the lottery when the odds are great against them
people are shooting for a dream
clearly though scam artists have to be a bit more subtle than simply promising millions the psychology of suckers is n't simply the psychology of the greedy
there also for instance the need to be part of the in - crowd
so one popular ploy is to make a prospective investor feel like an insider joining an exclusive group that is about to make a killing
between <unk> and <unk> for instance <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> sold interests in oil wells to a very select group of local residents while turning away numerous other eager investors
the owner of the company <unk> <unk> who has since pleaded guilty to state and federal fraud charges confided to investors that he had a secret agreement with <unk> <unk> <unk> and said <unk> the location of his wells was confidential according to a civil suit filed in a <unk> state court by the <unk> comptroller office
neither the <unk> agreement nor the wells existed the suit alleged <unk>
such schemes says <unk> <unk> <unk> chief of the financial - crimes unit of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> in <unk> <unk> appeal to investors desire to believe n this is really true and that they are part of a chosen group being given this opportunity
at times salesmen may embellish the inside information with the notion that this is some slightly shady slightly illegal investment n the person is being included in says <unk> <unk> <unk>
in appealing to those with a bit of larceny in their hearts the fraud artist can insist that a person keep an investment secret insulating himself from being discovered and keeping his victim from consulting with others
it also adds to the mystery of the venture
<unk> <unk> the boiler - room veteran believes that for many investors the get - rich-quick scams carry a longed - for element of excitement
once people got into it i was allowing them to live a dream he says
he phoned them with updates on the investment such as funny things that happened at the well that week he says n
you gave them some excitement that they did n't have in their lives
<unk> <unk> who was convicted in <unk> state court of selling unregistered securities and in <unk> state court of unlawful use of the telephone to defraud and deceive is now on probation
he says n he has quit the business and is back in school majoring in psychology with aspirations to go into industrial psychology
for some investors it the appearances that leave them deceived
the trappings of success go a long way wearing the right clothes doing the right things says <unk> <unk> an associate professor of psychology at <unk>
conservative appearances make people think n it a conservative investment
people honestly lose money on risky investments that they did n't realize <unk> were a crapshoot he says
<unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> attorney says n a promise of unrealistic returns would have made him leery
but <unk> <unk> who says n he lost n in one precious - metals deal and n in another says <unk> a salesman used a business - venture approach with him sending investment literature a contract limiting the firm liability and an insurance policy
when he visited the company office he says <unk> it had all the trappings of legitimacy
still others are stung by a desire to do both well and good says <unk> <unk> <unk> commanding officer of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> bunko - forgery division
born - again christians are the most visible targets of unscrupulous do - gooder investment pitches
but hardly the only ones the scams promise among other things to help save the environment feed starving families and prevent the disappearance of children
psychologists say n isolated people who do n't discuss their investments with others are particularly at risk for fraud
scam artists seek out such people or try to make sure that their victims isolate themselves
for instance salesmen may counter a man objection that he wants to discuss an investment with his wife by asking who wears the pants in your family
or an investor who wants his accountant advice may be told you seem like a guy who can make up his own mind
often con artists will try to disarm their victims by emphasizing similarities between them
<unk> lynes a retired engineer from <unk> <unk> says n he and his wife <unk> warmed to the investment pitches of a penny - stock peddler from <unk> - <unk> <unk> in <unk> after the broker told them n he too had once worked with <unk>
the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> have filed suit in <unk> state court against <unk> <unk> alleging fraud
they are awaiting an arbitration proceeding

fox hunting has been defined as the unspeakable in pursuit of the inedible but at least it exercise
at least it has a little dash
most of us have to spend our time on pursuits that afford neither drab duties rather than pleasures
like trying to buy life insurance for instance an endeavor notably lacking in dash
call it the uninformed trudging after the incomprehensible
but sooner or later most of us have to think about life insurance just as we often have to think about having root - canal work
and my time has come
i n married no children and employed in writing stories like this one
in times past life - insurance salesmen targeted heads of household meaning men but ours is a two - income family and accustomed to it
so if anything happened to me i want to leave behind enough so that my <unk> husband would be able to pay off the mortgage and some other debts though not i admit enough to put any potential second wife in the lap of luxury
figuring that maybe <unk> to <unk> would do but having no idea of what kind of policy i wanted i looked at the myriad products of a dozen companies and plunged into a jungle of gibberish
over the past decade or two while i was thinking about fox hunting the insurance industry has spawned an incredible number of products variations on products and variations on the variations
besides term life and whole life the old standbys we now have universal life universal variable life flexible adjustable universal life policies with persistency bonuses policies festooned with exotic riders living benefit policies and on and on
what to do
first generalize
<unk> of all their riders special provisions and other bells and whistles insurance policies can still be grouped under two broad categories so - called pure insurance which amasses no cash value in the policy and pays off only upon death and permanent insurance which provides not only a death benefit but also a cash value in the policy that can be used in various ways while the insured is still alive
if all n you want is death - benefit coverage pure insurance a term policy gives you maximum bang for your buck within limits
it much cheaper than permanent insurance bought at the same age
but term means just that the policy is written for a specific time period only and must be renewed when it expires
it may also stipulate that the insured must pass another medical exam before renewal if you flunk which means n you need insurance more than ever you may not be able to buy it
even if you healthy and can renew your premium will go up sharply because you that much older
so term insurance may not be as cheap as it looks
there are all sorts of variations on term insurance policies structured to pay off your mortgage debt term riders tacked on to permanent insurance and many others
one variation that appealed to me at first was the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> policy offered by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> unit to the parent company credit - card holders
upon examination however i wondered whether the plan made a lot of sense
<unk> said n it would charge me n a year for n of coverage and would pay me back all the premiums <unk> i put in if i canceled the policy after n years
sounds great or does it
first if i canceled i have no more insurance a not insignificant consideration
second the n n i get back would be much diminished in purchasing power by <unk> years of inflation <unk> not i would get the benefit of the investment income on my money income that would have exceeded the inflation rate and thus given the company a real profit
third and most important <unk> would charge me a far higher premium than other reputable companies would on a straight term policy for the same amount i be paying so heavily just to have the option of getting my premiums back that i almost have to cancel to make the whole thing worthwhile
that would be all right with <unk> which could then lock in its investment profit but it does n't add up to a smart money move for me
which goes to show that the <unk> <unk> applies in insurance as in anything else there is no free lunch there is only marketing
and the <unk> <unk> unique to insurance
if i die early i win a hollow victory since i ca n't enjoy it and if i live long the insurer wins
always
this is worth remembering when insurers and their salesmen try to sell you permanent insurance the kind that amasses cash value
the word death can not be escaped entirely by the industry but salesmen dodge it wherever possible or cloak it in euphemisms preferring to talk about savings and investment instead
the implication is that your permanent - insurance policy is really some kind of <unk> or mutual - fund account with an added feature
that is gilding the lily
the fact is that as a savings or investment vehicle insurance generally runs a poor second to any direct investment n you might make in the same things n the insurance company is putting your money into
that because you have to pay for the insurance portion of the policy and the effort required to sell and service the whole package
again no free lunch
this is reflected in a built - in mortality cost in effect your share of the company estimated liability in paying off beneficiaries of people who had the effrontery to die while under its protection
and in most cases a huge hunk of your premium in the initial year or two of the the policy is in effect paying the salesman commission as well investment returns on most policies are actually negative for several years largely because of this
so view permanent insurance for what it is a compromise between pure insurance and direct investment
the simplest most traditional form of permanent insurance is the straight whole life policy
you pay a set premium for a set amount of coverage the company invests that premium in a portfolio of its choosing and your cash value and dividends grow over the years
one newer wrinkle so called single - premium life you pay for the whole policy at once has been immensely popular in recent years for tax reasons the insured could extract cash value in the form of policy loans and none of the proceeds were taxable even though they included gains on investment
<unk> closed this loophole last year or thought n it did
however <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> has developed a combination plan of annuity and insurance coverage that it says n does not violate the new regulations and that allows policy loans without tax consequences
but the percentage of your cash reserve that you can borrow tax - free is very small
i not prepared in any case to put that much money into a policy immediately so i look into the broad category called universal life
hugely popular it is far more flexible than straight whole life
i can adjust the amount of insurance n i want against the amount going into investment i can pay more or less than the so - called target premium in a given year and i can even skip payments if my cash reserves are enough to cover the insurance portion of the policy
in looking at these and other policies i learn to ask pointed questions about some of the assumptions built into policy illustrations the rows of numbers that show me the buildup of my cash values over the years
they commonly give two scenarios one is based on interest rates that the company guarantees usually <unk> to <unk> and the other on the rate n it is currently getting on investment often n or more
projecting the latter over several decades i find n my cash buildup is impressive but can any high interest rate prevail for that long
not likely i think n
also some policy illustrations assume that mortality costs will decline or that i will get some sort of dividend bonus after the <unk> year
these are not certain either
companies are n't comfortable playing these games but they realize <unk> they under pressure to make their policies look good says <unk> <unk> <unk> an actuarial consultant at <unk> a unit of <unk> <unk> <unk> the big <unk> <unk> consulting firm
another factor n to consider some of the companies currently earning very high yields are doing so through substantial investment in junk bonds and you know how nervous the market has been about those lately
there are seemingly endless twists to universal life and it pays to ask questions about all of them
at a back - yard barbecue for example a friend boasts that she only have to pay premiums on her <unk> <unk> policy for seven years and that her death benefits will then be guaranteed
i call her agent <unk> <unk>
yes he says n premiums on such variable - rate coverage can be structured to vanish after a certain period but usually only if interest rates stay high enough to generate sufficient cash n to cover the annual cost of insurance protection
if interest rates plunge the insurer may be knocking on my door asking for steeper premium payments <unk> to maintain the same amount of protection
i do n't like the sound of that
some insurers have also started offering persistency bonuses such as extra dividends or a marginally higher interest yield if the policy is maintained for n years
but <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> - based financial consultant warns that many of these bonuses are just fantasies because most are n't guaranteed by the companies
and the feature is so new he adds n that no insurer has yet established a track record for actually making such payments
so - called living - benefits provisions also merit a close inspection
offered by insurers that include <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> these policy riders let me tap a portion of my death benefits while i still alive
some provisions would let me collect a percentage of the policy face value to pay for long - term care such as nursing - home stays others would allow payments for catastrophic illnesses and conditions such as cancer heart attarcks renal failure and kidney transplants
but the catastrophic events for which the policyholder can collect are narrowly defined vary from policy to policy and generally permit use of only a small fraction of the face amount of insurance
also financial planners advising on insurance say that to their knowledge there has not yet been a tax ruling exempting these advance payments from taxes
and considering the extra cost of such provisions some figure that people interested in say paying for extended nursing - home care would be better off just buying a separate policy that provides it
i more favorably impressed by no - load life even though it turns out to be low - load life
insureres selling these policies market them directly to the public or otherwise do n't use commissioned salesmen there is still a load annual administrative fees and initial setup charges but i figure that the lack of commission and of surrender fees for dropping the policy early still saves me a lot
i compared one universal policy for <unk> face amount from such an insurer <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> with a similar offering from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> which operates through n commissioned salesmen
after one year i could walk away from the <unk> policy with <unk> but id get only <unk> from the <unk>
the difference is magnified by time too
at age n when i stop paying premiums the <unk> offering would have a projected cash value n higher than the other even though the equitable policy illustration assumed a fractionally higher interest rate
did i buy it
well not yet
i thinking about using the <unk> annual premium to finance a trip to <unk> first
a person can do some heavy thinking about insurance there and shop for something more exciting while she doing it
<unk> <unk> <unk> will report that third - quarter profit rose more than <unk> from a year earlier though the gain is wholly due to asset sales <unk> <unk> chairman president and chief executive officer said n

through the first six months of <unk> sales had grown about n from the year - earlier period
<unk> of <unk> would make sales for the latest quarter n million compared with n million a year ago

<unk> in <unk> had projected lower third - quarter operating profit but higher profit for all of <unk>
he said n the company is still looking for a strong fourth quarter in all areas sales operating income and net income
<unk> <unk> attributed the decline in third - quarter operating profit to the stronger dollar which reduces the value of overseas profit when it is translated into dollars to accelerated buying of <unk> products in the second quarter because of a then - pending <unk> <unk> price increase and to higher marketing expenses for <unk> <unk> antacid whose sales and market share in the <unk> had slipped in the first half of <unk>
he said <unk> <unk> opted to sell <unk> and <unk> to raise revenue that would kick start its increased marketing efforts behind <unk> still its top - selling product with about n million in world - wide sales in <unk>

if you think n you have stress - related problems on the job there good news and bad news
you probably right and you are n't alone
a new <unk> <unk> study commissioned by the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> found that a full n of the work force at companies may suffer from anxiety disorders or a stress - related illness with about <unk> suffering from depression
the study surveyed a national group of medical directors personnel managers and employee assistance program directors about their perceptions of these problems in their companies
it is one of a series of studies on health commissioned by the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a non - profit organization with about n members
the stress study was undertaken because problems related to stress are much more prevalent than they seem said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> executive director of the business group
in presenting the study late last week <unk> <unk> estimated <unk> the cost of these types of disorders to business is substantial
occupational disability related to anxiety depression and stress costs about <unk> a case in terms of worker compensation
in terms of days lost on the job the study estimated that each affected employee loses about n work days a year because of stress anxiety or depression

we hope to sensitize employers to recognize the problems so they can do something about them <unk> <unk> said <unk>
early intervention into these types of problems can apparently save businesses long - term expense associated with hospitalization which sometimes results when these problems go untreated for too long
even the courts are beginning to recognize the link between jobs and stress - related disorders in compensation cases according to a survey by the <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk>
but although <unk> of the respondents in the study indicated that mental - health problems were fairly pervasive in the workplace there is still a social stigma associated with people seeking help

now his half - dozen employees work in an eighth - floor shop that he says <unk> is smaller than his old storage room
he also says n he is losing money now
he blames imports
but just down <unk> <unk> where about <unk> of <unk> fur garments are made <unk> <unk> has acquired two retail outlets broadened his fur - making line and expanded into leather
he credits imports
the difference lies in how the two entrepreneurial furriers reacted to the foreign competition and transformation of their industry over the past <unk> years
one stuck to old - line business traditions while the other embraced the change
the small good fur salon is not what it used to be says <unk> <unk> <unk> years old
we make the finest product in the world and the americans are being kicked around
<unk> <unk> though believes n imports have reinvigorated the industry in which he has worked for most of his n years
you got some minds here that wo n't think progressively he says
import competition for <unk> furs has risen sharply since furriers started aggressively marketing working - girl mink and similar lower - priced imported furs in recent years
merchants discovered a consumer largely ignored by higher - priced furriers the younger woman even in her late n who never thought <unk> she could buy a mink
the new market helped boost <unk> fur sales to about <unk> billion a year now triple the level in the late <unk>
it also opened the door to furs made in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other countries
<unk> <unk> a large south korean maker says n it operates n retail outlets in the <unk> and plans to open n more by the end of next year
<unk> <unk> and other old - line furriers call many of the the imports unstylish and poorly made
high - end <unk> furriers say n these imports have n't squeezed them
but low - priced and middle - priced furriers like <unk> <unk> who once saturated the five - block <unk> <unk> fur district say <unk> imports have cut their sales
a woman who once would have saved for two or three seasons to buy a u.s.-made mink can now get an imported mink right away for less than n
yet <unk> <unk> has turned the import phenomenon to his advantage
early in the decade he saw that fur workers in many foreign countries were willing to work longer hours at lower wages than their american counterparts and were more open to innovation
in <unk> he started a factory in <unk>
two years later he opened one in <unk> <unk>
he also noticed that foreign makers were introducing many variations on the traditional fur and he decided to follow suit
by combining his strengths in innovation and quality control with the lower costs of production abroad he says n he has been able to produce high - quality goods at low cost
to maintain control over production and avoid overdependence on foreign sources he says n he still makes most of his furs in the <unk>
but six years ago he also began importing from the <unk> <unk>
inspired by imports <unk> <unk> now makes fur muffs hats and flings
this year he produced a men line and offers dyed furs in red cherry red violet royal blue and forest green
he has leather jackets from <unk> that are lined with eel skin and topped off with raccoon - skin collars
from <unk> he has mink jackets with floral patterns made by using different colored furs
next he will be testing pictured embroidery called kalega made in the <unk> <unk>
he plans to attach the embroidery to the backs of mink coats and jackets
besides adding to sales leathers also attract retailers who may buy furs later he adds n
other furriers have also benefited from leathers
<unk> <unk> the <unk> owner of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> treats the reverse side of a persian lambskin to produce a reversible fur - and-leather garment
he says n it accounts for n of total sales
<unk> <unk> is also pushing retail sales
this year he bought two stores one in <unk> and one in <unk>
other furriers have also placed more weight on retailing
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> began retailing aggressively eight years ago and now retail sales account for about <unk> of gross income
in other moves <unk> <unk> says n he bought a truck three years ago to reach more retailers
since then he has expanded his fleet and can now bring his furs to the front door of retailers as far away as the midwest
small retailers who ca n't afford to travel to his <unk> <unk> showroom have become fair game
such moves have helped <unk> <unk> weather the industry slump of recent years
the industry enjoyed six prosperous years beginning in <unk> but since n sales have languished at their n billion peak
large furriers such as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> all reported losses in their latest fiscal years
aftereffects of the <unk> stock market crash head the list of reasons
in addition competition has glutted the market with both skins and coats driving prices down
the animal - rights movement has n't helped sales
warm winters over the past two years have trimmed demand too furriers complain n
and those who did n't move some production overseas suffer labor shortages
the intensive labor needed to manufacture furs in the <unk> is not as available as it was says <unk> <unk> who is starting overseas production
but even those who have found a way n to cope with the imports and the slump fear that furs are losing part of their allure
people are promoting furs in various ways and taking the glamour out of the fur business says <unk> <unk> divisional merchandise manager for <unk> <unk> department store in <unk>
you ca n't make a commodity out of a luxury insists <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> furrier
he contends that chasing consumers with low - priced imports will harm the industry in the long run by reducing the prestige of furs
but <unk> <unk> responds whatever people want to buy i sell
the name of the game is to move goods
four workers at <unk> <unk> headquarters have been diagnosed as having hepatitis and city health officials are investigating whether a cafeteria worker may have exposed hundreds of other <unk> employees to the viral infection company and city officials said n
the four cases were all reported to <unk> medical director and state and local health authorities

<unk> <unk> <unk> city health director said <unk> his staff suspects <unk> the hepatitis which can be highly contagious was spread by the cafeteria worker with the virus
the exact strain of hepatitis that the cafeteria worker contracted has n't been determined but should be known by the end of the week <unk> <unk> said <unk>
<unk> <unk> considered the least dangerous strain of the virus has been confirmed in at least one <unk> employee company and city officials said n
from a public health point of view we relieved because <unk> <unk> is rarely life - threatening said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> medical director
it a double - edged sword though because it is also the most contagious kind of hepatitis
<unk> officials began posting warning notices about the potential threat to exposure <unk> morning at various places at the company said <unk> <unk> spokesman <unk> <unk>
the company has begun offering shots of gamma globulin which will diminish the flu - like symptoms of <unk> <unk> in anyone who has contracted the disease <unk> <unk> said <unk>
we strongly recommending that anyone who has eaten in the cafeteria this month have the shot <unk> <unk> added and that means virtually everyone who works here

it is the right - wing guerrillas who are aligned with the drug traffickers not the left wing
this information was gleaned from your own news stories on the region

i suggest that the <unk> <unk> <unk> as well as other <unk> news publications of like mind should put its money where its mouth is lend computer equipment to replace that damaged at <unk> <unk> buy ad space publish stories under the bylines of <unk> <unk> journalists

in the wake of a slide in sterling a tailspin in the stock market and a string of problematic economic indicators british <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> promised gradual improvement in the <unk> economy
in a speech prepared for delivery to <unk> financial community <unk> <unk> summed up current economic policy as a battle to wring inflation out of the british economy using high interest rates as the essential instrument <unk> to carry out the campaign
two weeks after boosting base rates to <unk> he pledged that rates will have to remain high for some time n to come
<unk> <unk> also made it clear that he would be watching exchange rates carefully
a sinking pound makes imports more expensive and increases businesses expectations of future inflation he argued n
in an apparent warning to currency traders who have lately been selling the british currency he stated that the exchange rates will have a major role in the assessment of monetary conditions
in reaffirming the current monetary policy of using high interest rates to fight inflation and shore up the pound <unk> <unk> dismissed other approaches to managing the economy
he said <unk> he monitors the money - supply figures but does n't give them paramount importance as some private and government economists have suggested n
<unk> <unk> also dismissed the possibility of imposing direct credit controls on <unk> financial system
<unk> <unk> speech delivered at the <unk> <unk> of <unk> annual dinner at <unk> <unk> came on the heels of a grueling period for the <unk> economy
two weeks ago in a campaign to blunt inflation at home and arrest a world - wide plunge in the pound he raised base rates a full percentage point to <unk>
despite the increase the british currency slid below a perceived threshold of three marks early last week
it was quoted at n marks in late <unk> <unk> trading <unk>
leading up to the speech was a drumroll of economic statistics suggesting that the british war on inflation will be more bruising than previously assumed
unemployment in <unk> dropped to <unk> the lowest level since n
while lower joblessness is generally good news the hefty drop last month indicates that the economy is n't slowing down as much as hoped n despite a doubling of interest rates over the last n months
meanwhile average earnings in <unk> were up <unk> in <unk> over the previous year
another inflationary sign came in a surge in building - society lending to a record <unk> billion n billion last month a much higher level than economists had predicted
in a separate speech prepared for delivery at the dinner <unk> <unk> - <unk> <unk> of <unk> governor conceded that demand pressures were even more buoyant than had been appreciated when the british economy was heating up last year

<unk> <unk> <unk> claiming <unk> it has won the race in <unk> to introduce computers based on a powerful new microprocessor chip unveiled its n computer yesterday
the product is the first from a european company based on <unk> <unk> new <unk> <unk> microprocessor which works several times faster than previously available chips
<unk> - <unk> <unk> became the first company world - wide n to announce a product based on the chip earlier this month but it wo n't start shipping the computers until early next year
an <unk> spokesman said n the company factories are already beginning to produce the machine and that it should be available in <unk> by <unk>
what this means is that europeans will have these machines in their offices before americans do the spokesman said
the new chip is a very big step in computing and it is important that <unk> be one of the first out on the market with this product said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> an analyst at <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>
executives at <unk> whose earnings have been steadily sliding over the past couple of years have acknowledged that in the past they have lagged at getting new technology to market
<unk> <unk> said <unk> the new machines could steal some sales away from <unk> own minicomputers but would bring new sales among professionals such as engineers stockbrokers and medical doctors
although <unk> profits tumbled <unk> in the first half of this year she believes n <unk> restructuring last fall and its introduction of new products will begin to bear fruit with an earnings rebound next year especially if it can fulfill its promise to deliver the new machines by <unk>
we think n the worst is over in the european information - technology market she said n
depending on the type of software and peripherals used the machines can serve either as the main computer in a network of many terminals a role usually filled by a minicomputer as a technical workstation or as a very fast personal computer
it the missing link in <unk> product line between small personal computers and higher - priced minicomputers the <unk> spokesman said n
he added that <unk> will continue making its <unk> minicomputer line
the machines will cost around <unk> on average in <unk>
the <unk> <unk> chip can process n million instructions per second or <unk> while <unk> previous <unk> chip could handle only <unk> to <unk> <unk>
<unk> also plans to sell the <unk> computer in the <unk> starting next year through <unk> <unk> and through its <unk> <unk> unit which specializes in automating bank - branch networks
<unk> <unk> said n it received approval from the french government for its proposed n million acquisition of <unk> <unk>
the approval satisfies the remaining conditions of the purchase which is expected to close within two weeks

<unk> <unk> benefits will rise n next year to keep pace with inflation boosting the average monthly benefit to <unk> from <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> announced n
the higher payments will start with <unk> <unk> checks received on <unk> n <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> payments to the disabled also will rise n starting with checks received on <unk> <unk> <unk> increasing the maximum <unk> payment to <unk> from <unk> a month
the inflation adjustment also means that the maximum annual level of earnings subject to the wage tax that generates revenue for the <unk> <unk> trust fund will rise to <unk> in <unk> from <unk> this year
as mandated by law the tax rate will rise to <unk> in <unk> from <unk> and wo n't rise any further in the future
this means that the maximum yearly <unk> <unk> tax paid by workers and employers each will rise n next year to <unk>
beneficiaries aged n through n will be able to earn n without losing any <unk> <unk> benefits in <unk> up from <unk> this year
the exempt amount for beneficiaries under n will rise to <unk> from <unk>
the adjustments reflect the increase in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers from the third quarter of last year to the third quarter of this year
health - care companies should get healthier in the third quarter
medical - supply houses are expected to report earnings increases of about n on average for the third quarter despite sales increases of less than n analysts say n
to offset sluggish sales growth companies have been cutting staff mostly through attrition and slowing the growth in research and development spending
sales growth in the quarter was slowed by mounting pressure from groups of buyers such as hospitals to hold down prices
suppliers were also hurt by the stronger <unk> dollar which makes sales abroad more difficult
in some cases competition has squeezed margins
<unk> <unk> <unk> for example faces stiff competition from a japanese supplier in the important syringe market
the <unk> lakes <unk> company is expected to report sales growth of only <unk> to <unk> but should still maintain earnings growth of <unk> says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk> <unk>

but not every company expects to report increased earnings
<unk> <unk> <unk> yesterday said <unk> third - quarter net plunged <unk> to n million or n cents a share from n million or n cents a share a year earlier
sales fell <unk> to n million from n million
the <unk> <unk> <unk> company said n full - year earnings may be off n cents a share because the company removed a catheter from the market
in <unk> the company earned <unk> a share
the <unk> and <unk> <unk> had raised questions about the device design
some analysts add that third - party pressures to reduce health costs will continue to bedevil companies bottom lines
takeover speculation which has been buoying stocks of supply houses may also ease says <unk> <unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
as that wanes you going to see the stocks probably wane as well he says
hospitals companies meanwhile are reporting improved earnings
bolstered by strong performances by its psychiatric hospitals <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> reported net income of n million or n cents a share for the first quarter ended <unk> <unk> up from n million or n cents a share a year earlier
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> also reported favorable results with net income of n million or n cents in the fourth quarter ended <unk> <unk> up from n million or n cents a year earlier
analysts say n the handful of hospital companies that are still publicly traded are benefiting from several trends
most important hospital admission rates are stabilizing after several years of decline
moreover companies have sold off many of their smaller less - profitable hospitals and have completed painful restructurings
<unk> revenues for example are being boosted by large increases in enrollments in the company health maintenance organizations
says <unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk> <unk> the shakeout in the publicly traded companies is over
initial claims for regular state unemployment benefits rose to a seasonally adjusted <unk> during the week ended <unk> n from <unk> the previous week the <unk> <unk> said <unk>
the number of people receiving regular state benefits in the week ended <unk> <unk> decreased to a seasonally adjusted <unk> or <unk> of those covered by unemployment insurance from <unk> the previous week when the insured unemployment rate also was <unk>
counting all state and federal benefit programs the number of people receiving unemployment benefits in the week ended <unk> <unk> fell to <unk> from <unk> a week earlier
these figures are n't seasonally adjusted
a <unk> <unk> spokesman said n the unusually high number of initial claims for state unemployment benefits reflects the impact of <unk> <unk> on southern states particularly <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
the figure also may reflect initial claims filed by striking <unk> <unk> workers who have become eligible for unemployment benefits the official said <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> reported a n decline in net income on a modest revenue gain in its fiscal first quarter causing some analysts to predict weaker results ahead than they had expected
although the second - largest computer maker had prepared <unk> <unk> for a poor quarter analysts said n they were troubled by signs of flat <unk> orders and a slowdown in the rate of gain in foreign orders
the <unk> <unk> company is in a transition in which it is trying to reduce its reliance on mid - range machines and establish a presence in workstations and mainframes
net for the quarter ended <unk> <unk> fell to n million or <unk> a share from n million or <unk> a share a year ago
revenue rose <unk> to n billion from n billion
<unk> said <unk> a shift in its product mix toward low - end products and strong growth in workstation sales yielded lower gross margins
a spokesman also said n margins for the company service business narrowed somewhat because of heavy investments made in that sector
the lack of a strong product at the high end of <unk> line was a significant drag on sales
<unk> hopes to address that with the debut of its first mainframe - class computers next <unk>
the new line is aimed directly at <unk> <unk> machines <unk>
until the new mainframe products kick in there wo n't be a lot of revenue contribution at the high end and that hurt us said <unk> <unk> <unk> director of investor relations
he said n unfavorable currency translations were also a factor in the quarter
<unk> shares rose <unk> to n apiece in consolidated <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> trading yesterday
but analysts said that against the backdrop of a nearly n rise in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that should n't necessarily be taken as a sign of great strength
some cut their earnings estimates for the stock this year and predicted more efforts to control costs ahead
i think n the next few quarters will be difficult said <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
margins will remain under pressure and when the new mainframe does ship i not sure n it will be a big winner
<unk> <unk> said <unk> he was revising his estimate for <unk> current year from <unk> a share to well below n although he has n't settled on a final number
one troubling aspect of <unk> results analysts said <unk> was its performance in <unk>
<unk> said <unk> its overseas business which now accounts for more than half of sales improved in the quarter
it even took the unusually frank step of telling analysts in a morning conference call that orders in <unk> were up in double digits in foreign - currency terms
that gain probably translated into about <unk> to n in dollar terms well below recent quarters gains of above <unk> reckons <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>
that was a disappointment and a sign of overall computer - market softness in <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk>
<unk> <unk> with <unk> securities in <unk> <unk> dropped his estimate of <unk> full - year net to <unk> a share from <unk>
although overall revenues were stronger <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> drew down its european backlog and had flat world - wide orders overall
the bottom line is that it more hand to mouth than it has been before he said
<unk> <unk> said <unk> he believes that the roll - out of <unk> new mainframe will occur somewhat more leisurely than many of his investment colleagues expect <unk>
he said <unk> current expectations are for an entry level machine to be shipped in <unk> with all of the more sophisticated versions out by <unk>
for reasons n he would n't elaborate on he said n he sure n that schedule wo n't be met meaning less profit impact from the product for <unk> in the next few quarters
<unk> <unk> <unk> contributed to this article
<unk> <unk> <unk> reported <unk> third - quarter net income rose n bolstered by strong sales in its latin american business and surprisingly healthy profits from <unk> operations
<unk> said n net income for the quarter rose to n million or <unk> a share on sales that increased n to n billion
in the year - earlier period <unk> posted net income of n million or n cents a share
last year results included earnings from discontinued operations of n million or n cents a share
<unk> <unk> chairman and chief executive officer of <unk> said n earnings growth was fueled by strong sales in <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk>
results were also bolstered by a very meaningful increase in operating profit at <unk> <unk> business he said
operating profit at <unk> <unk> household products and personal care businesses which include such well - known brands as <unk> toothpaste and <unk> laundry detergent jumped more than <unk> the company said n
<unk> <unk> attributed the improvement to cost savings achieved by consolidating manufacturing operations blending together two sales organizations and more carefully focusing the company promotional activities
we done a lot to improve <unk> results and a lot more will be done <unk> <unk> said
improving profitability of <unk> operations is an extremely high priority in the company
<unk> results were at the high end of the range of analysts forecasts
the scope of the improvement in the <unk> business caught some analysts by surprise
the company domestic business especially its household products division has performed poorly for years
analysts say n the earnings improvement came from cutting costs rather than increasing sales
for the nine months net increased n to n million or <unk> a share
sales rose <unk> to n billion
the company earned n million or <unk> a share in the year - earlier period
<unk> <unk> net income included n million or n cents a share from discontinued operations
<unk> sold its hospital supply and home health care business last year
separately <unk> <unk> finalized an agreement with <unk> <unk> a tiny dental products and pharmaceutical concern based in <unk> <unk> to market in the <unk> four of <unk> <unk> - approved dental products
the products sealants and bonding materials used by dentists all contain fluoride that is released over time
the move is part of a drive n to increase <unk> business with dentists a company spokeswoman said n
terms of the agreement were n't given
<unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> it completed the sale of its <unk> restaurant franchise system to a subsidiary of <unk> <unk> for n million in cash
<unk> which is nearly half - owned by <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> said n it will distribute proceeds from the sale to unit holders as a liquidating dividend as soon as possible
the <unk> franchise system which generates about n million in sales annually represented substantially all of the partnership assets
the sale of the system has been challenged in a class - action suit on behalf of unit holders filed last week in a <unk> court <unk> said n
the company said <unk> it believes n the suit is without merit
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> unveiled a sweetened pension and early - retirement program for management that it hopes <unk> will enable it to save n million in the next year
<unk> also said n net income rose n in the third quarter
<unk> said <unk> its amended pension program will nearly double to n the number of managers eligible to retire with immediate pension payments
<unk> said that based on studies of other companies that have offered retirement plans it expects about one - third of its eligible managers to retire under the new program
<unk> said <unk> third - quarter net income grew despite stiff competition in all of the company markets
net income rose to n million or n cents a share from the year - earlier <unk> million or n cents a share
revenue edged up to n billion from n billion
the latest period net was reduced n million or nine cents a share for a change in depreciation method and concurrent changes in estimates of depreciable lives and net salvage for certain telecommunications equipment
the results roughly matched estimates of securities analysts who were encouraged by <unk> increasing its operating margin to <unk> from <unk> a year ago because of continued cost - cutting efforts
sales of long - distance services an extremely competitive market rose n
but the growth was partly offset by lower equipment sales and rentals and price cuts on some products
under the amended pension program <unk> managers who have at least five years of service will have five years added to their age and length of service for pension purposes
managers who retire <unk> n will have an additional n added to their monthly pension for as long as five years or age <unk> whichever comes earlier
an <unk> spokeswoman said n the company would likely replace about one - third of its managers who choose to retire with new employees
analysts hailed the sweetened pension package which they said n had been the subject of rumors for several months
this tells you n <unk> is serious about continuing to manage their cost structure and is committed to <unk> earnings growth said <unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk>
but other analysts expressed disappointment that the cost - cutting move wo n't result in even greater earnings growth
this is a good move but it only gets you to where people expectations already are in terms of earnings growth said <unk> <unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> said <unk> he had hoped that a cost savings of <unk> million would result in even greater growth than the <unk> annual earnings increase n <unk> has told analysts n it expects in the future
<unk> said n the special retirement option will increase fourth - quarter expenses
but the company said <unk> the amount ca n't be determined until it knows how many managers opt to retire
<unk> said n the expense increase will be largely offset by a gain from its previously announced plan to swap its holdings in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for shares in <unk> <unk> <unk> an italian holding company
for the nine months <unk> said n net income was <unk> billion or <unk> a share up n from <unk> billion or <unk> a share
revenue gained <unk> to n billion from n billion
in composite trading yesterday on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> shares closed at <unk> up n cents
when it comes to buying and selling shares <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> takes a back seat to no one
every dollar worth of stock in the <unk> <unk> money manager portfolio is traded seven or eight times a year the firm estimates n
that makes it the most active trader among all the nation investment advisers according to securities and <unk> <unk> filings
but wait a second
<unk> <unk> is an index fund the type of stolid long - term investor whose goal is to be nothing more than average
<unk> <unk> frenetic trading reflects the changes sweeping through the previously sleepy world of indexing
indexing for the most part has involved simply buying and then holding stocks in the correct mix to mirror a stock market barometer such as <unk> <unk> <unk> index and match its performance
institutional investors have poured <unk> billion into stock and bond indexing as a cheap and easy form of investment management that promises to post average market returns
these big investors have flocked to indexing because relatively few active stock pickers have been able to consistently match the returns of the <unk> <unk> or other bellwethers much less beat it
and the fees n investors pay for indexing run a few pennies for each <unk> of assets a fraction of the cost of active managers
that because computers do most of the work and low trading activity keeps a lid on commission costs
but today indexing is moving from a passive investment strategy to an increasingly active one
because index - fund managers are no longer satisfied with merely being average they have developed enhanced indexing strategies that are intended to outperform the market as much as three percentage points
indexing has been the most single successful investment concept in the last decade but the index money has been just sort of sitting there says <unk> <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> investors <unk> an indexer based in <unk> <unk>
now the interest is in what else can i do with that money
among the souped - up indexing strategies indexed portfolios can be built around thousands of stocks or just a few dozen rather than being restricted to the <unk> <unk> companies
they can ignore the <unk> <unk> stocks altogether and focus on particular types of stocks such as smaller companies those paying high dividends or companies in a particular industry state or country
with today computer - driven program trading techniques index funds can trade back and forth between stock - index futures and the actual stocks making up indexes such as the <unk> <unk>
futures and options also make it possible to build synthetic index funds that do n't actually own a single share of stock but can produce returns that match or exceed the broad stock market
one reason for these hybrids is that indexing rapid growth is slowing particularly for those plain vanilla funds that mirror the <unk> <unk>
there is n't a boatload of big investors out there still waiting to get into indexing says <unk> <unk> <unk> vice president of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which offers both indexing and active management services
after tripling in size in the past five years index funds now hold about n of the stock owned by pension funds
a further problem is razor - thin profits
plain - vanilla funds have become so commonplace that fees n they can charge have plunged to almost nothing and in some cases are just that
to land customers for their well - paying stock custodial business big banks sometimes will throw in basic indexing services for free
it like getting a free toaster when you open an account says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
as a result indexers have been looking for ways n to give investors something more than the average for their money
and many have been successful as in the case of the index fund operated by hyper - trader <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> has used enhanced indexing techniques to beat the <unk> <unk> returns by <unk> to n percentage points over the past four years with the same risk level as holding the <unk> <unk> stocks according to <unk> <unk> the firm president
strategies vary for <unk> <unk> which has n million under management
the firm sometimes buys <unk> n futures when they are selling at a discount to the actual stocks and will switch back and forth between stocks and stock - index futures to take advantages of any momentary price discrepencies
<unk> <unk> also goes through periods when he buys stocks in conjunction with options to boost returns and protect against declines
and in some months he buys stock - index futures and not stocks at all
by their nature our trades are very short - term and are going to create high turnover <unk> <unk> adds
the more turnover the better for our clients
big indexer <unk> <unk> <unk> also uses futures in a strategy that on average has added one percentage point to its enhanced fund returns
<unk> <unk> <unk> president of <unk> - based <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> agrees n it a good idea to jump between the <unk> <unk> stocks and futures
you buying the <unk> and you always want to hold the cheapest form of it he says
but some indexers make little or no use of futures saying that these instruments present added risks for investors
if the futures markets have a problem then those products could have a problem says <unk> <unk> managing director of <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> unit
<unk> currently is seeking approval to offer a new fund offering a return equal to the <unk> <unk> index plus <unk> of a percentage point
an added feature is that the slighty improved return would be guaranteed by <unk>
there are many other strategies <unk> to bolster the returns of index funds
they include
limited risk funds
these guarantee protection against stock market declines while still passing along most gains
here a fund may promise to pay back say n of every <unk> invested for a year even if the market goes much lower
the fund could invest <unk> for one year in <unk> bills yielding n to return the guaranteed n
that leaves n which could be used to buy <unk> <unk> options that will nearly match any gain in the <unk> index
manager replication funds
say <unk> a big investor is interested in growth stocks
instead of hiring one of the many active managers specializing in growth stocks indexers can design a portfolio around the same stocks the portfolio will be maintained by computer reducing both fees and in theory risk because of the large number of stocks
we see a lot of interest in those kind of things says <unk> <unk> a vice president of <unk> <unk>
people comfortable with the passive approach are using them for other strategies
tilt funds
this is an index fund with a bet
instead of replicating the <unk> <unk> or some other index exactly some stocks are overweighted or underweighted in the portfolio
one simple approach is to exclude <unk> <unk> companies considered bankruptcy candidates this can avoid weak sisters but also can hurt when a company like <unk> <unk> rebounds
another approach an investor with n million might use <unk> million to buy the <unk> <unk> index and spend the other n million on a favorite group of stocks
specialized funds
indexes can be constructed <unk> to serve social goals such as eliminating the stocks of companies doing business in <unk> <unk>
other funds have been designed to concentrate on stocks in a geographic area in order to encourage local investment
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for example has about n million invested in a fund of n companies that are either <unk> - based or have n of their work forces in the state
short interest on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> declined for the second consecutive month this time n while the <unk> <unk> <unk> reported its third consecutive record month of short interest
the <unk> <unk> reported that short interest dropped to n shares as of <unk> n from <unk> shares in mid - <unk>
<unk> short interest climbed <unk> to n shares from <unk> shares
for the year - earlier month the <unk> <unk> reported <unk> shares indicating a n year - to-year rise while the <unk> reported <unk> shares a <unk> leap
<unk> short interest has been heading upward since mid - <unk> with increases in each month since then except at mid - <unk>
traders who sell short borrow stock and sell it betting that the stock price will decline and that they can buy the shares back later at a lower price for return to the lender
short interest is the number of shares that have n't yet been purchased for return to lenders
although a substantial short position reflects heavy speculation that a stock price will decline some investors consider an increase in short interest bullish because the borrowed shares eventually must be bought back
fluctuation in short interest of certain stocks also may be caused partly by arbitraging
the figures occasionally include incomplete transactions in restricted stock
the level of negative sentiment measured by the <unk> <unk> short interest ratio slipped to <unk> from last month <unk>
the ratio is the number of trading days at the exchange average trading volume that would be required to convert the total short interest position
some analysts suggest however that the ratio has weakened in value as an indicator because options and other products can be used to hedge short positions
<unk> <unk> led the <unk> <unk> list of largest short volumes with n shares
<unk> has proposed to acquire <unk> - <unk> <unk> consisting of the auto parts division and some debt of <unk> <unk> for n million of cash and securities
<unk> <unk> <unk> posted the biggest increase in short volume on the <unk> <unk> exchange up <unk> shares to <unk>
<unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> the entity formed from the recent acquisition of <unk> <unk> by <unk> - <unk> <unk> logged the largest volume decline n shares to <unk>
short interest in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> plunged to n shares from <unk> shares a month earlier
also closely watched is <unk> <unk> where short interest slid to n shares from <unk>
on a percentage basis <unk> <unk> <unk> led the gainers leaping to <unk> shares from three shares
<unk> <unk> <unk> led the percentage decliners dropping to <unk> shares from <unk>
the <unk> short interest volume leader again was <unk> <unk> <unk> rising to <unk> shares from <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> posted the largest volume increase n shares to <unk>
the company is under an investigation concerning procedures <unk> to gain <unk> and <unk> <unk> approval of generic drugs
<unk> has denied any wrongdoing
the largest volume drop down n shares to <unk> came in shares represented by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> depositary receipts
the company is facing a takeover proposal from the financier <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> led the percentage increases rising to <unk> shares from <unk>
<unk> holdings <unk> <unk> dropped the most on a percentage basis to <unk> shares from <unk>
the adjacent tables show the <unk> <unk> and <unk> issues in which a short interest position of at least n shares existed as of mid - <unk> or in which there was a short position change of at least n shares since mid - <unk>
your <unk> n editorial pitiful <unk> <unk> correctly states that i was critical of the <unk> administration failure to have any plan in place to respond in a timely fashion to the opportunities to oust <unk> <unk> presented by the attempted military coup on <unk> n
you are absolutely wrong however in opining that this position is some kind of flip - flop something newly arrived at as a result of reading the opinion polls
my position is one founded on both the facts and the law
although you may have forgotten public opinion about <unk> <unk> is where it is in large measure because of my investigation of his years of involvement in narcotics smuggling and simultaneous work as a <unk> operative
the public made up its mind about <unk> <unk> largely as a result of the hearings <unk> i chaired in the <unk> on <unk> and <unk> of the <unk> relations <unk> on <unk> n <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and again on <unk> n n
it was during those hearings that the nation first learned the breadth and depth of <unk> <unk> criminality and of his enduring relationships with a variety of <unk> government agencies
those hearings also highlighted how <unk> <unk> was able to use his relationships with these agencies to delay <unk> action against him and to exploit the administration obsession with overthrowing the sandinistas to protect his own drug - dealing
as former <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> testified before the subcommittee the <unk> administration knew that <unk> <unk> was involved with narcotics but made a decision in the summer of n to put <unk> <unk> on the shelf until <unk> was settled
as the report issued by the subcommittee concluded our government did nothing regarding <unk> <unk> drug business and substantial criminal involvement because the first priority was the <unk> war
this decision resulted in at least some drugs entering the <unk> <unk> as a hidden cost of the war
unfortunately this problem continued even after <unk> <unk> indictment
throughout <unk> and this year i and others in <unk> have pressed the <unk> to develop a plan for pushing this narcokleptocrat out of <unk>
regrettably two administrations in a row have been unwilling and unable to develop any plan military or economic for supporting the panamanian people in their attempts to restore democracy
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
for vietnamese these are tricky often treacherous times
after years of hesitation economic and political reform was embraced at the end of <unk> but ringing declarations have yet to be translated into much action
<unk> is finding that turning a stagnant socialist order into a dynamic free market does n't come easy
here is how three vietnamese are coping with change
the tire
<unk> <unk> <unk> is living proof that old ways die hard
<unk> <unk> used to be an oddity in <unk> a private entrepreneur
his business success made him an official target in pre - reform days
<unk> <unk> now n years old invented a fountain pen n he and his family produced from plastic waste
later he marketed glue
both products were immensely popular
for his troubles <unk> <unk> was jailed three times between <unk> and <unk>
though his operation was registered and used only scrap he was accused of conducting illegal business and possessing illegal materials
once he was held for three months without being charged
things were supposed to change when <unk> economic reforms gathered pace and for awhile they did
after years of experimenting <unk> <unk> produced a heavy - duty bicycle tire that outlasted its state - produced rival
by <unk> he was selling thousands of tires
newspapers published articles about him and he was hailed as the tire king
his efforts earned a gold medal at a national exhibition and attracted renewed attention from local authorities
district police in <unk> descended on his suburban home which he and his large family used as both residence and factory and demanded proof <unk> the house and equipment were his
he produced it
that was the first time n they lost and i won he says
he was further questioned to determine if he was a real working man or an exploiter
says <unk> <unk> when i showed n it was from my own brain they lost for the second time
but a few days later the police accused him of stealing electricity acquiring rubber without permission and buying stolen property
warned n he was to be jailed again he fled to the countryside
his family was given three hours n to leave before the house and contents were confiscated
with only the clothes n they were wearing family members moved to a home owned by one of <unk> <unk> sons
after six months on the run <unk> <unk> learned <unk> the order for his arrest had been canceled
he rejoined his family in <unk> n and began the long struggle for justice pressing everyone from <unk> municipal officials to <unk> <unk> deputies for restoration of his rights
he and his family kept afloat by repairing bicycles selling fruit and doing odd jobs
<unk> <unk> achieved a breakthrough in <unk> and became a minor celebrity again when his story was published in a weekly newspaper
in <unk> <unk> months after the sixth congress formally endorsed family - run private enterprise district authorities allowed <unk> <unk> to resume work
by late last year he was invited back as the tire king to display his products at a national exhibition
national leaders stopped by his stand to commend his achievements
<unk> <unk> now produces n bicycle and motorbike tires a month and <unk> tins of tire - patching glue in the son small house
eighteen people pack the house two rooms the chans four of their n children with spouses and eight of n grandchildren
most sleep on the floor
come daybreak eight family members and two other workers unroll a sheet of raw rubber that covers the floor of the house and spills out onto the street
the primitive operations also burst out the back door into a small courtyard where an ancient press squeezes rubber solution into a flat strip and newly made tires are cooled in a bathtub filled with water
<unk> <unk> talks optimistically of expanding maybe even moving into the import - export field
first however he has unfinished business
when district authorities allowed him to resume manufacturing they released only one of his machines
they did n't return the rubber stocks that represent his capital
nor did they return his house and contents which he values at about <unk>
he wants to recover more than just his property though
i want my dignity back he says
the
<unk> <unk> seemed an obvious choice when the <unk> <unk> <unk> was looking for a new editor <unk> to reform its weekly newspaper <unk> <unk>
after the sixth congress journalists seized the opportunity provided by the liberalization to probe previously taboo subjects
<unk> <unk> <unk> years old had solid reformist credentials he had lost his official position in the association in he early n because he questioned the intrusion of politics into literature
appointed editor in chief in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> rapidly turned the staid <unk> <unk> into <unk> hottest paper
circulation soared as the weekly went way beyond standard literary themes to cover vietnamese society and its ills
readers were electrified by the paper audacity and appalled by the dark side of life n it uncovered
one article recounted a decade - long struggle by a wounded soldier to prove officially n he was alive
another described how tax - collection officials in <unk> <unk> province one night stormed through homes and confiscated rice from starving villagers
the newspaper also ran a series of controversial short stories by <unk> <unk> <unk> a former history teacher who stirred debate over his interpretation of vietnamese culture and took a thinly veiled swipe at writers who had blocked his entry into their official association
<unk> <unk> quickly made influential enemies
those who manage ideology and a large number of writers reacted badly to the restyled paper says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a literary critic
after months of internal rumblings <unk> <unk> was fired last <unk>
his dismissal triggered a furor among intellectuals that continues today
under <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> protected the people instead of the government says <unk> <unk> a poet who is the paper bureau chief for southern <unk>
the paper reflected the truth
for the leadership that was too painful n to bear
the billionaire
<unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> entrepreneur of the <unk>
her challenge is to keep her fledgling empire on top in the n
<unk> <unk> did n't wait for the reforms to get her start
she charged ahead of the government and the law to establish <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as the biggest rice dealer in the country
her success which included alleviating an urban food shortage in the early n helped persuade <unk> to take the reform path
her story is becoming part of local folklore
a lifelong revolutionary with little education who fought both the french and the u.s.-backed <unk> regime she switched effortlessly to commerce after the war
her instincts were capitalistic despite her background
as she rode over regulations only her friendship with party leaders including <unk> <unk> <unk> then <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> party secretary kept her out of jail
following <unk> <unk> appointment as secretary - general of the party at the sixth congress <unk> <unk> has become the darling of doi moi the vietnamese version of perestroika
the authorities have steered foreign reporters to her office to see an example of the new way of thinking
foreign publications have responded with articles declaring her <unk> richest woman
some people call me the communist billionaire she has told visitors
actually <unk> <unk> <unk> is about as poor as almost everyone else in this impoverished land
she has indeed turned <unk> <unk> <unk> into a budding conglomerate but the company itself remains state - owned
she manages it with the title of general - director
the heart of the business is the purchase of rice and other commodities such as corn and coffee from farmers in the south paying with fertilizer farm tools and other items
last year <unk> <unk> <unk> says n it bought two million metric tons of unhusked rice more than <unk> of the country output
the company operates a fleet of trucks and boats n to transport the commodities to its warehouses
a subsidiary company processes commodities into foods such as instant noodles that are sold with the rice through a vast retail network
in recent years <unk> <unk> has started to diversify the company taking a <unk> stake in newly established partly private <unk> and <unk> <unk> and setting up <unk> <unk> which owns and operates <unk> first oil refinery
<unk> <unk> says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> last year increased pretax profit n to the equivalent of about n million on sales of n million
she expects both revenue and profit to gain this year
she is almost cavalier about the possibility <unk> <unk> reforms will create rivals on her home turf
i do n't mind the competition inside the country she says
i am only afraid that with <unk> poor - quality products we ca n't compete with neighboring countries
the earthquake that hit the <unk> <unk> <unk> area is n't likely to result in wholesale downgrading of bond ratings officials at the two major rating agencies said n
<unk> <unk> <unk> is reviewing debt issued by <unk> <unk> counties and there are potential isolated problems said <unk> <unk> <unk> a managing director
the agency is preparing a report n to be issued today on the earthquake impact on the property- and casualty - insurance industry
the only securities n so far to be singled out are those issued by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> investors <unk> <unk> said n it is reviewing with an eye toward a possible downgrade the ratings on <unk> <unk> <unk> bonds long - term deposits and the preferred - stock rating of its parent company <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
as for property and casualty insurers <unk> said <unk> preliminary estimates suggest that losses should not have a significant impact on most insurers financial condition but it raises concerns about potentially substantial risks longer - term
losses from the earthquake are expected to be of similar magnitude to those of <unk> <unk> according to <unk>
your <unk> n editorial a democratic <unk> <unk> contained an error
in the third paragraph it referred to the senators seeking loophole suggestions from lobbyists for various sectors of the economy
among them banana farmers
the only significant commercial banana farmers in the <unk> are in <unk>
the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to which nearly all of them belong has no lobbyist
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> reported a net loss of n million or nine cents a share for its first quarter ended <unk> n citing factors as varied as hurricane damage an advance in graphics technology and the strengthening dollar

the revenue will be regained in the current period he added n
there are no plans to initiate a common stock dividend <unk> <unk> said <unk> explaining that the board continues to believe <unk> shareholders are best served by reinvesting excess cash
<unk> <unk> said <unk> the first - quarter loss also heavily reflected a rapid change in graphics technology that left reseller channels with too many of the old computer graphics boards and too few new monitors compatible with the new graphics boards
<unk> <unk> does n't make the monitors
an accelerating move by personal computer manufacturers n to include advanced graphics capabilities as standard equipment further dampened reseller purchases of western <unk> equipment
the other areas of the business storage and microcomputers were very good <unk> <unk> said
he said <unk> <unk> <unk> has reacted swiftly to the movement to video graphics array vga graphics technology from the old enhanced graphics adapter ega which has a lower resolution standard technology and now is one of the leading producers of these newer units

still <unk> <unk> said <unk> our stock is grossly undervalued
he said n the company has cut operating expenses by about n over the last few quarters while maintaining research and development at about n to n of sales
as part of its reorganization this week <unk> <unk> has divided its business into two segments storage products including controllers and disk drives and microcomputer products which include graphics communications and peripheral control chips
graphics communications and peripheral control chips were combined because increasingly multiple functions are being governed by a single chip
storage which includes computer controllers and n disk drives represents nearly two - thirds of the company business
disk drives which allow a computer to access its memory generated <unk> more revenue in the most recent period compared with the fiscal first quarter a year earlier
computer parts are getting ever smaller <unk> <unk> said <unk> a shrinking that has propelled laptops into position as the fastest - growing segment of the computer business

plans to dissolve many of the trade barriers within <unk> in <unk> creates significant opportunities for the company he said <unk> particularly since <unk> <unk> already manufactures there
capitalizing on that presence <unk> <unk> is launching a major effort to develop the embryonic reseller market in <unk>
directors of state - owned <unk> <unk> del <unk> approved a two - step capital - boosting transaction and a change in the bank rules that will help it operate more like a private - sector institution
until now <unk> top managers and its directors have been appointed by a <unk> decree
but under the bank proposed statutes an assembly of shareholders must approve board members
the bank chairman and director general who also sit on the board still would be appointed by the <unk>
<unk> which is controlled by the italian <unk> was rocked by the disclosure last month that its <unk> branch extended more than n billion in unauthorized credits to <unk>

but the plan only threatens to heighten the tension and confusion already surrounding the cases that were filed in <unk> n
the peruvian mineral concern n million claim stems from <unk> jury award in a case stemming from the brothers alleged attempts to corner the <unk> silver market

stock - market fears and relatively more attractive interest rates pushed money - market mutual fund assets up n billion in the latest week the sharpest increase in almost two years
the <unk> funds tracked by the <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> - based trade group rose to n billion a record
the n billion increase was the strongest weekly inflow since <unk> n
the increase was spread fairly evenly among all three types of funds
individual investors represented in the general - purpose and broker - dealer fund categories pulled money from the stock market after its big drop last <unk> and put the money into funds said <unk> <unk> <unk> vice president and chief economist of the <unk>

domestic lending for real estate and property development was the source of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . most recent spate of financial troubles the institution executive chairman <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk>
speaking to reporters this week after <unk> <unk> shareholders approved a rescue plan <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> heavy lending to the property sector rocked the bank when property prices in <unk> plummeted in <unk>
he said <unk> the bank could n't wait any longer for prices to recover and for borrowers to service their loans
so the bank board decided to make n billion malaysian dollars <unk> n million in provisions for interest payments from loans previously recorded as revenue but never actually received by the bank and to submit a bailout package n to replenish the bank paid - up capital
the predicament he added <unk> was similar to the <unk> <unk> <unk> property - price collapse which exposed the involvement of <unk> <unk> former subsidiary in the colony in the largest banking scandal in <unk> history
the subsidiary <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was left with <unk> $ n billion in bad loans made to <unk> <unk> property speculators
both episodes wiped out <unk> <unk> shareholders funds
each time the bank n shareholder <unk> <unk> <unk> . or <unk> the national oil company has been called upon to rescue the institution
in five years <unk> which became the dominant shareholder in a n rescue exercise has spent about <unk> $ n billion to prop up the troubled bank
<unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> the capital restructuring plan has been approved by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and central bank
<unk> <unk> <unk> is expected to approve the plan
once the plan is approved <unk> <unk> <unk> said n most of <unk> <unk> nonperforming loans will have been fully provided for and the bank will be on track n to report a pretax profit of between <unk> $ n million and <unk> $ n million for the fiscal year ending <unk> <unk>
for the previous financial year the bank would have reported a pretax profit of <unk> $ n million if it had n't made provisions for the nonperforming loans he said n
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> prohibited the bank from identifying delinquent borrowers said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
but public documents indicate n n or more of the bank provisions were made for foregone interest on a <unk> $ n million loan to <unk> dominant political party the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to build its convention and headquarters complex in <unk> <unk>
the loan to <unk> was made in <unk> n
we lent a lot of money all over the place said <unk> <unk> <unk> who refused to discuss the bank outstanding loans
as well as the <unk> $ n billion in provisions announced on <unk> n the restructuring package covers an additional <unk> $ n million in provisions made in earlier years but never reflected in a reduction of the bank paid - up capital
at the end of the exercise the cash injection from <unk> will increase the bank paid - up capital to <unk> $ n billion after virtually being wiped out by the new provisions
<unk> <unk> might have stepped from a recruiting poster for young republicans
<unk> n years old a singer in her church choir she symbolizes a generation that gave its heart and its vote to <unk> <unk>
i felt kind of safe she says
no longer
when the <unk> <unk> opened the door this year to new restrictions on abortion <unk> <unk> opened her mind to democratic politics
then a political novice she stepped into a whirl of pro - choice marches house parties and fund - raisers
now she leads a grassroots abortion - rights campaign in <unk> <unk> for pro - choice democratic gubernatorial candidate <unk> <unk>
this is one where i cross party lines she says rejecting the anti - abortion stance of <unk> <unk> opponent <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
people my age thought <unk> it was n't going to be an issue
now it has especially for people my age
polls bear out this warning but after a decade of increased republican influence here the new politics of abortion have contributed to a world turned upside down for <unk> <unk>
unless he closes the gap republicans risk losing not only the governorship but also the assembly next month
going into the <unk> the <unk> is paying a price for the same conservative social agenda that it used to torment democrats in the past
this change comes less from a shift in public opinion which has n't changed much on abortion over the past decade than in the boundaries of the debate
<unk> <unk> own highest court remains a liberal bulwark against major restrictions on abortion but the <unk> <unk> <unk> ruling <unk> vs. <unk> has engaged voters across the nation who had been insulated from the issue
before <unk> pro - choice voters could safely make political decisions without focusing narrowly on abortion
now the threat of further restrictions adds a new dimension bringing an upsurge in political activity by abortion - rights forces
a recent pro - choice rally in <unk> drew thousands and in a major reversal <unk> is defying a presidential veto and demanding that <unk> abortions be permitted in cases of rape and incest
if <unk> had n't happened you would n't be here <unk> <unk> tells a reporter in the <unk> office of the <unk> <unk> for women
we could have shouted from the rooftops about <unk> and no one would have heard us
<unk> <unk> is a proving ground for this aggressive women's - rights movement this year
the infusion of activists can bring a clash of cultures
in <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> rights <unk> <unk> whose goal is to sign up n pro - choice voters targets a union breakfast to build labor support for its cause
the league organizers seem more a fit with a convention next door of young aerobics instructors in leotards than the beefy union leaders i wish <unk> i could go work out says a slim activist
a labor chief speaks sardonically of having to man and woman <unk> <unk> phones
no age group is more sensitive than younger voters like <unk> <unk>
a year ago this fall <unk> <unk> voters under <unk> favored <unk> <unk> by <unk> to <unk> over <unk> <unk> according to a survey then by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
a matching <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> poll last month showed a complete reversal
voters in the same age group backed <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> over <unk> <unk>
abortion alone ca n't explain this shift but <unk> <unk> is a model of how so personal an issue can become a baseline of sorts in judging a candidate
by a <unk> ratio voters appear more at ease with <unk> <unk> stance on abortion and polls indicate n his lead widens when the candidates are specifically linked to the issue
the times are my times says <unk> <unk>
the <unk> <unk> congressman still carries himself with a trademark i'm - coming-down-your-throat intensity but at a pause in <unk> <unk> <unk> parade recently he was dancing with his wife in the middle of the avenue in the city old italian - american ward
after losing by fewer than <unk> votes in the n governor race he has prepared himself methodically for this moment including deciding in recent years n he could no longer support curbs on federal funding for <unk> abortions
if you going to be consistent and say n it is a constitutionally protected right he asks how are you going to say n an upscale woman who can drive to the hospital or clinic in a nice car has a constitutional right and someone who is not in great shape financially does not
<unk> <unk> by comparison seems a shadow of the confident hawk who defended <unk> <unk> before national cameras at <unk> - <unk> hearings two years ago
looking back he says n he erred by stating his personal opposition to abortion instead of assuring voters that he would n't impose his views on policy as governor
it is a distinction that satisfies neither side in the debate
he does n't know himself <unk> <unk> of the <unk> rights <unk> says of <unk> <unk> position
even abortion opponents however angry with <unk> <unk> ca n't hide their frustration with the republican ambivalence
he does n't want to lead the people says <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk>
moreover by stepping outside the state pro - choice tradition <unk> <unk> aggravates fears that he is too conservative as well on more pressing concerns such as auto insurance rates and the environment
he hurt himself further this summer by bringing homosexual issues into the debate and by wavering on this issue and abortion he has weakened his credibility in what is already a mean - spirited campaign on both sides
elected to <unk> in <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> is part of a generation of young conservatives who were once very much in the lead of the rightward shift under <unk> <unk>
like many of his colleagues he did n't serve in <unk> in the n yet embraced a hawkish defense and foreign policy even voting against a n resolution critical of the <unk> mining of nicaraguan harbors
<unk> <unk> and the writers <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> were influences and <unk> <unk> own conservative credentials proved useful to the current <unk> <unk> <unk> governor <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> primary here
the same partnership is now crucial to <unk> <unk> fortunes but the abortion issue is only a reminder of the gap between his record and that of the more moderate pro - choice <unk> <unk>
while the <unk> <unk> congressman pursued an anti - government anti - tax agenda in <unk> <unk> <unk> was approving increased income and sales taxes at home and overseeing a near doubling in the size of <unk> <unk> budget in his eight years in office
<unk> forces play down any differences with <unk> <unk> but this history makes it harder for the conservative to run against government
<unk> <unk> free - market plan to bring down auto insurance rates met criticism from <unk> <unk> own insurance commissioner
<unk> <unk> is further hobbled by a record of votes opposed to government regulation on behalf of consumers
fluent in <unk> from his days in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> actively courts minority voters but seems oddly over his head
he is warm and polished before a puerto rican <unk> in <unk> <unk>
yet minutes after promising to appoint hispanics to high posts in state government he is unable to say whether he has ever employed any in his congressional office
i do n't think n we do now he says

<unk> and <unk> are essential <unk>
elected to <unk> as a <unk> baby in <unk> he ran for governor three years later
in the opinion of many he has n't stopped running since even though he declined a rematch with <unk> <unk> in <unk>
his base in <unk> <unk> and on the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> helped him sustain a network of political - action committees n to preserve his edge
with limited budgets for television in a high - priced market <unk> <unk> higher recognition than his rival is a major advantage
more than ever his pro - consumer and pro - environment record is in sync with the state
auto insurance rates are soaring
a toxic - waste-dump fire destroyed part of an interstate highway this summer
in <unk> an important swing area republican freeholders now run on a slogan promising to keep the county clean and green
<unk> <unk> savors this vindication but at age n the congressman is also a product of his times and losses
he speaks for the death penalty as if reading from <unk> <unk> to increase state revenue he focuses not on taxes but on audits <unk> to cut waste
hard - hitting consultants match ads with <unk> <unk> team and <unk> <unk> retools himself as the lean mean democratic fighting machine of the <unk>
appealing to a young audience he scraps an old reference to <unk> and <unk> and instead quotes the <unk> <unk>
the lyric chosen long strange night may be an apt footnote to television spots by both candidates intended to portray each other as a liar
the democratic lawmaker fits a pattern of younger reformers arising out of old machines but his ties to <unk> remain a sore point because of the county past corruption
his campaign hierarchy is chosen from elsewhere in the state and faced with criticism of a sweetheart bank investment he has so far blunted the issue by donating the bulk of his profits to his alma mater <unk> <unk> <unk>

consumer prices rose a surprisingly moderate n in <unk> pushed up mostly by a jump in clothing costs the <unk> <unk> reported <unk>
energy costs which drove wholesale prices up sharply during the month continued to decline at the retail level pulling down transportation and helping to ease housing costs
the report was the brightest news n the financial markets had seen since before the stock market plunged more than n points last <unk>
the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> rallied on the news closing <unk> points higher at n
bond prices also jumped as traders appeared to read the data as a sign that interest rates may fall
but many economists were not nearly as jubilant
the climb in wholesale energy prices is certain to push up retail energy prices in the next few months they warned n
they also said <unk> the dollar is leveling off after a rise this summer that helped to reduce the prices of imported goods
i think n inflation is going to pick up through the fall said <unk> <unk> a specialist on inflation who runs an economic consulting firm here
it has been in what i would describe as a lull for the past several months
we had whopping declines in consumer energy prices in each of the past three months and at the wholesale level those are fully behind us now said <unk> <unk> chief domestic economist at <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
because wholesale energy prices shot up by a steep n last month many analysts expected energy prices to rise at the consumer level too
as a result many economists were expecting the consumer price index to increase significantly more than it did
but retail energy prices declined n in <unk>
though analysts say <unk> competition will probably hold down increases in retail energy prices many expect some of the wholesale rise to be passed along to the consumer before the end of the year
still some analysts insisted that the worst of the inflation is behind
it increasingly appears that <unk> was a temporary inflation blip and not the beginning of a cyclical inflation problem argued <unk> <unk> chief economist at <unk> - <unk> securities <unk> in <unk> <unk>
in both <unk> and n consumer prices rose n
a run - up in world oil prices last winter sent consumer prices soaring at a n annual rate in the first five months of this year but the subsequent decline in energy prices has pulled the annual rate back down to n
<unk> <unk> predicted that world business competition will continue to restrain prices
the bottom line is n it seems to me that the economic environment has become very very competitve for a lot of businesses he said
back in <unk> business was operating at fairly tight capacity so businesses felt n they could raise prices
now he said n a slowdown in economic activity has slackened demand
the mild inflation figures renewed investors hopes that the <unk> <unk> will ease its interest - rate stance
the steep climb in producer prices reported last <unk> fostered pessimism about lower interest rates and contributed to the stock market <unk> plunge that day
in the past several days however the <unk> central bank has allowed a key interest rate to fall slightly to try to stabilize the markets
analysts say n <unk> policy makers have been wary of relaxing credit too much because they were still uncertain about the level of inflation in the economy
excluding the volatile categories of energy and food leaving what some economists call the core inflation rate consumer prices still rose only n in <unk>
transportation costs actually fell n and housing costs gained only n
apparel prices rocketed up <unk> but that was after three months of declines
medical costs continued their steep ascent rising n after four consecutive months of <unk> increases
car prices another area that contributed to the steep rise in the wholesale index last month still showed declines at the consumer level
they dropped <unk> as dealers continued to offer rebates n to attract customers
food prices rose n for the second month in a row far slower than the monthly rises earlier in the year
separately the <unk> <unk> reported that average weekly earnings rose n in <unk> after adjusting for inflation following a n decline in <unk>
all the numbers are adjusted for seasonal fluctuations
here are the seasonally adjusted changes in the components of the <unk> <unk> consumer price index for <unk>
after watching interest in the sport plummet for years the ski industry is trying to give itself a lift
across the country resorts are using everything from fireworks to classical - music concerts to attract new customers
some have built health spas business centers and shopping villages so visitors have more n to do than ski
and this week the industry efforts will go national for the first time when it unveils a n million advertising campaign
such efforts unheard of only a few years ago are the latest attempts to revive the sagging n billion <unk> ski industry
since the start of the decade lift - ticket sales have grown only <unk> a year on average compared with n annual growth rates in the <unk> and <unk>
last season lift - ticket sales fell for the first time in seven years
by some estimates nearly a fourth of all <unk> ski areas have been forced to shut down since the early n
competition and mounting insurance and equipment costs have been the undoing of many resorts
but another big problem has been the aging of baby boomers
skiing after all has mainly been for the young and daring and many baby boomers have outgrown skiing or have too many family responsibilities <unk> to stick with the sport
in its new ad campaign created by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the ski industry is trying to change its image as a sport primarily for young white people
one <unk> <unk> spot features a diverse group of skiers gracefully gliding down sun - drenched slopes senior citizens minorities families with children even a blind skier
ski school is great cries out a tot bundled in a snowsuit as he plows down a bunny slope
you never know you try says a black skier
we used to show some hot - dog skier in his twenties or thirties going over the edge of a cliff says <unk> <unk> a spokeswoman for the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the trade group sponsoring the campaign
ski promotions have traditionally avoided the touchy issue of safety
but the new commercials deal with it indirectly by showing a woman smiling as she tries to get up from a fall
we wanted to show n it okay if you fall says <unk> <unk>
most people think n if you slip you wind up in a body cast
the ad campaign represents an unusual spirit of cooperation among resorts and ski equipment makers normally they only run ads hyping their own products and facilities
but in these crunch times for the ski industry some resorts such as the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> ski areas in <unk> <unk> have even started shuttle - busing skiers to each other slopes and next year plan to sell tickets good for all local lifts
many resorts also are focusing more on the service side of their business
since n of skiers are parents many slopes are building nurseries expanding ski schools and adding entertainment for kids
<unk> <unk> now has a playland that looks like an old mining town kids can ski through and pan for fool gold
for n they can enjoy their own nightly entertainment with dinner without mom and dad
a few years ago parents usually had to hire a sitter or take turns skiing while one spouse stayed with the children
most parents who had to go through that never came back says <unk> <unk> president of <unk> associates <unk> which owns and operates the <unk> and nearby <unk> <unk> resorts
to make skiing more convenient for time - strapped visitors several resorts are buying or starting their own travel agencies
in one phone call ski buffs can make hotel and restaurant reservations buy lift tickets rent ski equipment and sign up for lessons
and resorts are adding other amenities such as pricey restaurants health spas and vacation packages with a twist
during <unk> <unk> week for example visitors at <unk> <unk> in <unk> can take a hot - air balloon ride
people these days want something else <unk> to do besides ski and sit in the bar says <unk> <unk> executive director of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>
the ski industry hopes to increase the number of skiers by n million to about n million in the next five years with its latest ads and promotions
but some think n that being overly optimistic
for one thing it may be tough to attract people because skiing is still expensive a lift ticket can cost up to <unk> a day and equipment prices are rising
and most vacationers still prefer a warm climate for their winter excursions
an <unk> <unk> <unk> survey of its travel agents revealed that only n believe n their clients will pick a trip this winter based on the availability of winter sports as opposed to n who think that warm - weather sports will be the deciding factor
even if they could bring in that many new skiers i do n't know if the industry could handle that kind of an increase says <unk> <unk> <unk> editor and publisher of the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
most people will come on the weekend the slopes will be overcrowded and then these new skiers wo n't come back
they did n't play the third game of the <unk> <unk> on <unk> night as scheduled and they did n't play it on <unk> or <unk> either
but you knew that did n't you
they are supposed to play the game next <unk> in <unk> <unk> here
the theory is that the stadium damaged by <unk> earthquake will be repaired by then and that people will be able to get there
like just about everything else that remains to be seen
aftershocks could intervene
but at least the law of averages should have swung to the favorable side
it may seem trivial to worry about the <unk> <unk> amid the destruction to the <unk> <unk> wrought by <unk> quake but the name of this column is on sports so i feel obliged to do so
you might be interested to know that baseball not survival appeared to be the first thought of most of the crowd of <unk> that had gathered at <unk> at n p.m. <unk> a half - hour before game time when the quake struck
as soon as the tremor passed many people spontaneously arose and cheered as though it had been a novel kind of pre - game show
one fan seated several rows in front of the open upper - deck auxiliary press section where i was stationed faced the assembled newsies and laughingly shouted we arranged that just for you guys
i thought and i sure others did you should n't have bothered
i slept through my only previous brush with natural disaster a tornado n or so summers ago near <unk> <unk> <unk> so i was unprepared for one reaction to such things the urge to talk about them
perhaps primed by the daily diet of radio and tv reporters thrusting microphones into people faces and asking how they feel about one calamity or another fellow reporters and civilians who spied my press credential were eager to chat
it felt like i was on a station platform and a train went by said one man describing my own reaction
a women said <unk> she saw the park light standards sway
a man said <unk> he saw the upper rim undulate
i saw neither
dictates of good sense to the contrary not withstanding the general inclination was to believe that the disturbance would be brief and that ball would be played
i was near the top of the stadium and saw a steel girder bow six feet from where i sat but i stayed put for <unk> or <unk> minutes confessed a friend
i guess <unk> i thought this is the <unk> <unk> and i not gon na wimp out
here in the <unk> <unk> though folks do not stay uninformed for long
electrical power was out in still - daylighted <unk> <unk> but battery - operated radios and television sets were plentiful
within a few minutes the true extent of the catastrophe was becoming clear
its <unk> <unk> measurement was reported as <unk> then <unk> then n
a section of the <unk> <unk> had collapsed as had a part of <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>
people had died
at n p.m. scheduled game time having passed some fans chanted let play ball
no longer innocent they qualified as fools
the stadium was ordered evacuated soon afterward the announcement made over police bullhorns cited the power outage but it later was revealed that there also had been damage of the sort reported by my friend
outside i spotted two young men lugging blocks of concrete
pieces of <unk> they said
the crowd remained good natured even bemused
tv reporters interviewed fans in the parking lots while a few feet away others watched the interviews on their portable tvs
the only frenzy n i saw was commercial booths selling <unk> <unk> commemorative stamps and dated postmarks were besieged by fledgling speculators who saw future profit in the items
the traffic jam out of the park was monumental
it took me a half - hour to move <unk> feet from my parking spot in an outer lot to an aisle and an additional hour to reach an inner roadway a half - block away
the six - mile trip to my airport hotel that had taken n minutes earlier in the day took more than three hours
at my hotel the <unk> power was out some interior plaster had broken loose and there had been water damage but little else
with garpian randomness a hotel across the street the <unk> had been hit harder a large sheet of its concrete facade and several window balconies were torn away
the <unk> staff had kindly set out lighted candles in the ballroom prepared a cold - cuts buffet and passed around pillows and blankets
i fell asleep on the lobby floor next to a man wearing a <unk> <unk> jacket
i expected him to say i told you so but he already was snoring
the journalistic consensus was that the earthquake made the <unk> <unk> seem unimportant
my response was that sports rarely are important only diverting and the quake merely highlighted that fact
should the rest of the <unk> be played at all
sure
the quake and baseball were n't related unlike the massacre of athletes that attended the <unk> olympics
that heavily politicized event learned nothing from the horrifying experience and seems doomed to repeat it
two ironies intrude
this has been widely dubbed the <unk> <unk> after the local subway line and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
flags fly at half - staff for the death of <unk> <unk> the late baseball commissioner and now the <unk> <unk> lies in ruins
a <unk> that was shaping up as the dullest since the one - sided <unk> - <unk> <unk> go of n has become memorable in the least fortunate way
still its edge is lost
it now will be played mostly for the record and should be wrapped up as quickly as possible without off days
and i will never again complain about a rainout
the disarray in the junk - bond market that began last month with a credit crunch at <unk> <unk> has offered commercial banks a golden opportunity to play a greater role in financing billion - dollar takeovers
but two big <unk> <unk> banks seem to have kicked those chances away for the moment with the embarrassing failure of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> to deliver <unk> billion in bank financing for a leveraged buy - out of <unk> <unk> parent <unk> <unk>
for more than a decade banks have been pressing <unk> and banking regulators for expanded powers to act like securities firms in playing <unk> <unk> lucrative takeover game from giving mergers advice all the way to selling and trading high - yield junk bonds
those expanded powers reached their zenith in <unk> when <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> provided mergers advice an equity investment and bank loans for the n billion leveraged buy - out of <unk> airlines parent <unk> <unk>
one of the major selling points used by <unk> <unk> financier <unk> <unk> in getting the takeover approved was that the deal did n't include any junk bonds
that was seen as an advantage in lobbying airline employees and <unk> regulators for approval of the contested takeover
all n billion in debt for the deal was supplied by banks
<unk> <unk> <unk> - head of mergers and acquisitions at <unk> <unk> <unk> says n it is natural for banks to try to expand beyond their bread - and-butter business of providing senior debt for buy - outs
but the <unk> collapse he says <unk> may tell you n it not going to work that easily
<unk> <unk> a mergers adviser in <unk> <unk> <unk> who aided <unk> <unk> investor <unk> <unk> on the bids which put both <unk> and <unk> in play as takeover candidates this year says that banks have been preparing to play a larger and larger role in acquisition financing
<unk> <unk> says that in the past banks would normally have loaned n of a total buy - out price with the loans secured by the target company assets
another n of the borrowed funds would come from the sale to investors of junk bonds which offer less security and typically carry higher yields than bank loans
<unk> <unk> purchase of <unk> <unk> <unk> notes <unk> was probably the most aggressive to date with bank debt at <unk> of the purchase price
but <unk> <unk> says that <unk> failure to deliver on its promise to raise the <unk> bank debt for a labor - management buy - out group is very distressing to potential users of a highly - confident letter from commercial banks
his client <unk> <unk> used just such a letter from <unk> in pursuing <unk> <unk> later agreed to work with a competing <unk> buy - out group
executives of <unk> and <unk> <unk> declined to comment on either the <unk> situation or on the changing nature of banks role in financing takeovers
in the wake of <unk> problems prices of junk bonds tumbled throwing into doubt the ability of corporate acquirers to finance large takeovers with the help of junk bond sales
<unk> <unk> senior managing director at manufacturers <unk> <unk> <unk> says <unk> the falloff in junk bonds may yet open new business opportunities to banks in structuring takeovers
but he warns that banks will have to have enough discipline <unk> not to make loans that are too risky
in fact manufacturers <unk> said in its third - quarter earnings report that fees from syndicating loans to other banks dropped <unk> to n million
we did n't take part in a lot of deals because their credit quality was poor says a bank spokesman
<unk> <unk> <unk> head of syndications and private placements at <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> he believes n banks can still make a credible offer of one - stop shopping for takeover finance
as evidence he cites yesterday arrangement for the final financing of a <unk> billion bid for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in which <unk> served as both the lead bank and an equity investor
beyond the current weakness in the junk bond market banks have another advantage over investment banks in financing contested takeovers
<unk> <unk> <unk> a takeover lawyer at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> notes that a political and emotional bias has developed against junk bonds
one hostile bidder who deliberately avoided using junk bonds was <unk> <unk> <unk> in its initial offer to acquire <unk> <unk> for n billion or <unk> a share
a <unk> spokesman says n that decision was based on the financial not political drawbacks of junk bonds
but some observers believe <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> wanted to avoid the possible taint of being perceived as a corporate raider in his controversial bid for <unk>
in the end <unk> <unk> used junk bonds so that he could raise <unk> bid to n a share
some <unk> - morning quarterbacks said <unk> the initial lower bid without junk bonds was a factor in his losing the company
<unk> eluded <unk> by acquiring <unk> communications <unk>
the success of the <unk> financing and the failure of the <unk> deal also seem to highlight the important new role in takeover financing being played by japanese banks
japanese banks accounted for n of the <unk> bank debt according to a report by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
but it was broad - scale rejection by japanese banks that helped seal the fate of the attempt to buy <unk>
<unk> and <unk> are attempting to put together a new lower bid
<unk> <unk> chief economist of the <unk> for <unk> affairs <unk> a <unk> research center on finance and economics says the junk bond market became very jittery and there a fear of a coming recession and the possible bankruptcy of lbo companies
<unk> - <unk> <unk> filed suit in federal court here alleging that a group that holds n of its stock made false deceptive and misleading statements in recent regulatory filings and public announcements
<unk> - <unk> complaint claims that the group led by investor <unk> <unk> <unk> violated securities laws by failing to disclose plans to purchase n of the company shares outstanding and that when the required <unk> - <unk> filing eventually was made it did n't disclose the group alleged earlier violation of the so - called prior - notice requirements of the law
<unk> <unk> could n't immediately be reached to comment
but when <unk> last week publicly questioned the legality of the group filing procedures the <unk> <unk> investor said we complied with every law and he denied any wrongdoing
the <unk> group said in a <unk> and <unk> <unk> filing in early <unk> that it may seek a controlling interest in <unk> - <unk> or seek representation on the company board
<unk> has said n it does n't intend to be acquired by the <unk> group or any other party
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> battered by lower volume and higher costs posted a n drop in third - quarter earnings
the nation fourth - largest steelmaker earned n million or n cents a share compared with n million or <unk> a share a year earlier when the industry was enjoying peak demand and strong pricing
sales fell to n million from n billion
the earnings also mark a significant drop from the second quarter n million or <unk> a share
moreover the earnings were well below analysts expectations of about <unk> a share
in composite trading on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> closed yesterday at <unk> a share down n
the company attributed the earnings drop to lower volume related to seasonal demand and the soft consumer durable market especially in the automotive sector
however the company also lost orders because of prolonged labor talks in the second quarter
third - quarter shipments slipped <unk> from the year - ago period and n from this year second quarter
profit of steel shipped for the company steel segment slid to <unk> a ton from <unk> a ton a year earlier and n a ton a quarter earlier
analysts noted that the disappointing results do n't reflect lower prices for steel products
<unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said n higher prices for galvanized and cold - rolled products offset lower prices for bar hot - rolled and structural steel
<unk> steel which primarily serves the construction market was especially hurt by a <unk> price drop <unk> <unk> said <unk>
the company said <unk> its integrated steel sector was also hurt by higher raw material repair and maintenance and labor costs
the increased labor costs became effective <unk> <unk> under terms of the four - year labor agreement with the <unk> steelworkers union
meanwhile the company service center segment which saw operating profit drop to n million from n million a year ago experienced much of the same demand and cost problems as well as start - up costs associated with a coil processing facility in <unk> and an upgraded computer information system
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> the company short - term outlook is clouded by uncertainties in the economy and financial markets
however he noted that steel mill bookings are up from early summer levels and that he expects the company to improve its cost performance in the fourth quarter
in the first nine months profit was n million or <unk> a share on sales of n billion compared with n million or <unk> a share on sales of n billion a year earlier
the seismic activity of a financial market bears a resemblance to the seismic activity of the earth
when things are quiet low volatility the structures on which markets stand can be relatively inefficient and still perform their functions adequately
however when powerful forces start shaking the market structure the more earthquake - resistant it is the better its chance for survival
<unk> financial markets do not yet have all the required modern features required to make them fully aftershock - resistant
investors lack equal access to the markets trading arena and its information
that structural lack is crucial because investors are the only source of market liquidity
and liquidity is what markets need to damp quakes and aftershocks
in today markets specialists on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and upstairs market makers in the over - the-counter market are the only market participants allowed to play a direct role in the price - determination process
when they halt trading all market liquidity is gone
and when any component of the market cash futures or options loses liquidity the price discovery system the way n prices are determined becomes flawed or is lost entirely for a time
last <unk> the n as well as two years ago this week the markets became unlinked
when that happened seismic tremors of fear much like the shock waves created by an earthquake coursed through the market and increased the market volatility
lack of important needed information can cause fear
fear is the father of panic
panic frequently results in irrational behavior
and in financial markets irrational behavior is sometimes translated into catastrophe
when market tremors start it is crucial that as much information about transaction prices and the supply - demand curve buy and sell orders at various prices be made available to all not just to market makers
because of a lack of information and access many investors including the very ones whose buying power could restore stability and damp volatility are forced to stand on the sidelines when they are most needed because of their ignorance of important market information
to add aftershock - damping power to <unk> markets a modern electronic trading system should be implemented that permits equal access to the trading arena and the information that would automatically accompany such access by investors particularly institutional investors
contrary to some opinions the trading activities of specialists and other market makers do not provide liquidity to the market as a whole
what market makers provide is immediacy a very valuable service
liquidity is not a service
it is a market attribute the ability to absorb selling orders without causing significant price changes in the absence of news
market makers buy what investors wish to sell their business is reselling these unwanted positions as quickly as possible to other investors and at a profit
as a result while any one customer may purchase immediacy by selling to a market maker which is micro - liquidity for the investor the market as a whole remains in the same circumstances n it was before the transaction the unwanted position is still an unwanted position only the identity of the seller has changed
in fact it can be argued that increasing capital commitments by market makers a result of some <unk> crash studies also increases market volatility since the more securities are held by market makers at any given time the more selling pressure is overhanging the market
in an open electronic system any investor wishing to pay for real - time access to the trading arena through a registered broker - dealer would be able to see the entire supply - demand curve buy and sell orders at each price entered by dealers and investors alike and to enter and execute orders
current quotations would reflect the combined financial judgment of all market participants not just those of intermediaries who become extremely risk - averse during times of crisis
investors and professionals alike would compete on the level playing field <unk> <unk> sought and called a national market system not yet achieved almost n years ago when it passed the securities <unk> <unk> of <unk>
last <unk> market gyrations did not result in severe aftershocks
were we smart or just lucky
i not certain
but i am sure n we need to maximize our earthquake protection by making certain that our market structures let investors add their mighty shock - damping power to our nation markets
<unk> <unk> is chairman of his own consulting company in <unk> <unk>
now you see it now you do n't
the recession that is
the economy stutter steps leave investors wondering whether things are slowing down or speeding up
so often are government statistics revised that they seem to resemble a spinning weather vane
for the past seven years investors have had the wind at their backs in the form of a generally growing economy
some may have forgotten and some younger ones may never have experienced what it like to invest during a recession
different tactics are called for as losing money becomes easier and making money becomes tougher
for those investors who believe or fear that n will be a recession year many economists and money managers agree on steps that can be taken to lower the risks in a portfolio
in a nutshell pros advise investors who expect a slowdown to hold fewer stocks than usual and to favor shares of big companies in defensive industries
a heavy dose of cash is prescribed along with a heavier - than-usual allotment to bonds preferably government bonds
it tempting to think n these defensive steps can be delayed until a recession is clearly at hand
but that may not be possible because recessions often take investors by surprise
they always seem to come a bit later than you expect
when they do hit they hit fast says <unk> <unk> <unk> chief financial economist at the <unk> <unk> division of <unk> - <unk> <unk>
though he himself does n't expect a recession soon <unk> <unk> advises people who do that the best thing n to be in is long that is <unk> to <unk> <unk> bonds
the reason is simple <unk> <unk> says <unk> <unk> rates almost always decline during recession
as surely as a seesaw tilts falling interest rates force up the price of previously issued bonds
they are worth more because they pay higher interest than newly issued bonds do
that effect holds true for both short - term and long - term bonds
but short - term bonds ca n't rise too much because everyone knows <unk> they will be redeemed at a preset price fairly soon
long - term bonds with many years left before maturity swing more widely in price
but not just any bonds will do
corporate bonds are usually not a good bet in a recession <unk> <unk> says
as times get tougher investors fret about whether companies will have enough money <unk> to pay their debts
this hurts the price of corporate bonds
also he notes n most corporate bonds are callable
that means that a corporation after a specified amount of time has passed can buy back its bonds by paying investors the face value plus in some cases a sweetener
when interest rates have dropped it makes sense for corporations to do just that they then save on interest costs
but the investors are left stranded with money n to reinvest at a time when interest rates are puny
if corporate bonds are bad in recessions junk bonds are likely to be the worst of all
it an absolute necessity to get out of junk bonds when a recession is in the offing says <unk> <unk> <unk> professor of finance at <unk> <unk>
such bonds are very sensitive to the downside and this could be a disaster
municipal bonds are generally a bit safer than corporate bonds in a recession but not as safe as bonds issued by the federal government
during an economic slump local tax revenues often go down raising the risks associated with at least some municipals
and like corporates many municipal bonds are callable
but a few experts going against the consensus do n't think n bonds would help investors even if a recession is in the offing
one of these is <unk> <unk> <unk> director of research for <unk> <unk> <unk> a brokerage house in <unk> who thinks that we either in a recession or about to go into one
what more he thinks n this could be a nastier recession than usual once the downturn comes it going to be very hard n to reverse
investors he advises n should be cautious holding fewer stocks than usual and also shunning bonds
because he sees a <unk> to n base rate of inflation in the economy he doubts that interest rates will fall much any time soon
instead <unk> <unk> says <unk> investors probably should be carrying a very high level of cash by which he means such so - called cash equivalents as money - market funds and <unk> bills
<unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> also recommends that investors go heavily for cash
he is n't sure n a recession is coming but says <unk> the other likely alternative reignited inflation is just as bad
this late in an expansion the economy tends to veer off either into damaging inflation or into a recession <unk> <unk> says <unk>
the <unk> <unk> <unk> plan for a soft landing he says n requires the <unk> to navigate an ever - narrowing corridor
a soft landing is n't something that can be achieved once and for all <unk> <unk> adds <unk>
it has to be engineered over and over again month after month
he believes that the task facing <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is so difficult that it resembles juggling a double - bladed ax and a buzz saw
and in a sense that the kind of task n individuals face in deciding what to do about stocks the mainstay of most serious investors portfolios
it comes down to a question of whether to try to time the market
for people who can ride out market waves through good times and bad stocks have been rewarding long - term investments
most studies show that buy - and-hold investors historically have earned an annual return from stocks of <unk> to <unk> including both dividends and price appreciation
that well above what bonds or bank certificates have paid
moreover because no one knows for sure just when a recession is coming some analysts think n investors should n't even worry too much about timing
trying to time the economy is a mistake says <unk> <unk> chief investment officer of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> notes that some economists have been predicting a recession for at least two years
investors who listened and lightened up on stocks have just hurt themselves he says n
<unk> <unk> adds that people who jump in and out of the stock market need to be right about <unk> of the time to beat a buy - and-hold strategy
frequent trading runs up high commission costs
and the in - and-outer might miss the sudden spurts that account for much of the stock market gains over time
still few investors are able to sit tight when they are convinced n a recession is coming
after all in all five recessions since <unk> stocks declined
according to <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> the average drop in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was about n and the decrease began an average of six months before a recession officially started
by the time n a recession is official two consecutive quarters of declining gross national product much of the damage to stocks has already been done and in the typical case the recession is already half over
about six months before a recession ends stocks typically begin to rise again as investors anticipate a recovery
the average recession lasts about a year
unfortunately though recessions vary enough in length so that the average ca n't reliably be used to guide investors in timing stock sales or purchases
but whatever their advice about timing none of these experts recommend jettisoning stocks entirely during a recession
for the portion of an investor portfolio that stays in stocks professionals have a number of suggestions
<unk> <unk> advocates issues with low price - earnings ratios that is low prices in relation to the company earnings per share
low p - e stocks he says <unk> vastly outperform others during a recession or bear market
in good times he says n they lag a bit but overall they provide superior performance
<unk> . <unk> urges investors to discard stocks in small companies
small - company shares typically fall more than big - company stocks in a recession he says n
and in any case he argues n stocks of small companies are almost as overpriced as they were <unk> n <unk> just before the crash
for example <unk> <unk> says <unk> stocks of small companies are selling for about <unk> times cash flow
cash flow basically earnings plus depreciation is one common gauge of a company financial health
that ratio is dangerously close to the ratio of n that prevailed before the <unk> stock - market crash <unk> <unk> says <unk>
and it way above the ratio <unk> times cash flow that bigger companies are selling for
another major trick in making a portfolio recession - resistant is choosing stocks in defensive industries
food tobacco drugs and utilities are the classic examples
recession or not people still eat smoke and take medicine when they sick
<unk> <unk> <unk> editor of <unk> <unk> in <unk> offers one final tip for recession - wary investors
keep some money available for opportunities he says
if the recession does hit there will be some great investment opportunities just when things seem the blackest

some industry groups consistently weather the storm better than others
the following shows the number of times n these industries outperformed the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> during the first six months of the past seven recessions
bond prices posted strong gains as investors went on a bargain hunt
but while the overall market improved the new - issue junk - bond market continued to count casualties even as junk - bond prices rose
yesterday <unk> - <unk> securities <unk> said n it postponed a n million senior subordinated debenture offering by <unk> <unk> <unk>
and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> scrambled to restructure and improve the potential returns on a <unk> million debenture offering by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that was still being negotiated late last night
the issue by <unk> <unk> <unk> is one of the so - called good junk - bond offerings on the new - issue calendar
some analysts said <unk> the restructuring of the railroad concern issue shows how tough it is for underwriters to sell even the junk bonds of a company considered to be a relatively good credit risk
since last week junk - bond market debacle many new issues of high - yield high - risk corporate bonds have either been scaled back delayed or dropped
on <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> had to slash the size of <unk> airlines junk - bond offering to n million from n million
<unk> <unk> <unk> has delayed <unk> <unk> <unk> n billion junk - bond offering while it restructures the transaction
last week the <unk> <unk> offering was sweetened to include warrants that allow bondholders to acquire common stock
<unk> - <unk> said n the <unk> issue was delayed because of market conditions
everything is going through firehoops right now and <unk> <unk> <unk> is no exception said <unk> <unk> vice president high - yield research at <unk>
portfolio managers say n sweeteners like equity kickers and stricter protective covenants may increasingly be required to sell junk - bond deals
<unk> <unk> managing director of high - yield investments at <unk> <unk> <unk> said the <unk> <unk> <unk> offering was restructured in part because several large insurance buyers right now are demanding equity as part of the package
if you going to take the risk in this market you want something extra
<unk> <unk> likes the offering
but several mutual - fund managers nervous about the deteriorating quality of their junk - bond portfolios and shy about buying new issues said n they staying away from any junk security that is n't considered first rate for its class
while they consider the <unk> <unk> <unk> issue to be good they do n't view it as the best
to lure buyers to the <unk> <unk> <unk> bonds portfolio managers said <unk> <unk> <unk> sweetened the transaction by offering the bonds with a resettable interest rate and a n equity kicker
the bonds are expected to have a <unk> <unk> coupon rate
the equity arrangement apparently would allow bondholders to buy a total of n of the stock of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> western parent company
<unk> <unk> declined to comment on the restructuring
according to some analysts familiar with the negotiations the n of equity would come directly from <unk> <unk> and a fund affiliated with the investment bank <unk> <unk> which would reduce their <unk> equity holdings by n each
that would leave the <unk> fund with a <unk> stake and <unk> <unk> with <unk>
despite the problems with new issues high - yield bonds showed gains in the secondary or resell market
junk bonds ended about one - half point higher with so - called high - quality issues from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> rising one point
in the <unk> market the benchmark <unk> bond rose seven - eighths point or n for each <unk> face amount
the gain reflects fresh economic evidence that inflation is moderating while the economy slows
that raised hopes that interest rates will continue to move lower
the <unk> <unk> reported that consumer prices rose just n last month slightly lower than some economists had expected
but there were also rumors yesterday that several japanese institutional investors were shifting their portfolios and buying long - term bonds while selling shorter - term treasurys
short - term <unk> securities ended narrowly mixed with two - year notes posting slight declines while three - year notes were slightly higher
yesterday the <unk> executed four - day matched sales a technical trading operation designed to drain reserves from the banking system
the move was interpreted by some economists as a sign that the <unk> does n't want the federal funds rate to move any lower than the <unk> <unk> at which it has been hovering around during the past week
the closely watched funds rate is what banks charge each other on overnight loans
it is considered an early signal of <unk> credit policy changes
the fact that they did four - day matched sales means n they are not in a mood n to ease aggressively
they are telling us that <unk> <unk> is as low as they want to see the fed funds rate said <unk> <unk> at <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk>
the benchmark <unk> bond was quoted late at a price of <unk> <unk> to yield n compared with n n to yield <unk> <unk>
the latest n notes were quoted late at <unk> <unk> to yield n compared with n n to yield n
short - term rates rose yesterday
the discount rate on three - month <unk> bills rose to <unk> from <unk> <unk> while the rate on six - month bills rose to <unk> from <unk>
meanwhile the <unk> sold <unk> billion of n bills yesterday
the average yield on the bills was n down from <unk> at the previous <unk> bill auction <unk> n
yesterday yield was the lowest since <unk> on <unk> <unk>
here are details of the auction
rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value
thus higher bidding narrows the investor return while lower bidding widens it
the percentage rates are calculated on a <unk> year while the coupon - equivalent yield is based on a <unk> year
corporate
junk bond price climbed yesterday despite skittishness in the new - issue market for high - yield securities
dealers said <unk> junk bond issues on average were up by <unk> to n point with so - called quality issues from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> posting one - point gains
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> debentures traded at n after trading around par earlier this week and <unk> <unk> <unk> subordinated debentures of n were at <unk> <unk> after trading at below par earlier this week
investment - grade bonds were unchanged
activity was brisk in the high - grade general obligation market as a series of sell lists hit the street and capped upward price movement in the sector
traders estimated that more than n million of high - grade bonds was put up for sale via bid - wanted lists circulated by a handful of major brokers
there was speculation that the supply was coming from a commercial bank portfolios
according to market participants the bonds were met with decent bids but the volume of paper left high grades in the <unk> and under maturity range unchanged to <unk> percentage point higher in yield
away from the general obligation sector activity was modest
long dollar bonds were flat to up n point
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> issue of <unk> was up n at <unk> <unk> bid to yield about <unk> down n percentage point
the debt of some <unk> issuers pulled off lows reached after <unk> massive earthquake although traders said <unk> market participants remained cautious
<unk> expects to rely on federal emergency funds and its <unk> billion in general fund reserves to meet the estimated n million to <unk> billion in damages resulting from the quake according to a state official
it also unclear precisely how the state will rebuild its reserve said <unk> <unk> <unk> assistant director of <unk> department of finance although she noted that a bond offering for that purpose is n't anticipated
meanwhile new issuance was slow
the largest sale in the competitive arena was a n million issue of school financing bonds from the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
a balance of n million remained in late order - taking according to the lead manager
mortgage - backed
mortgage securities generally ended <unk> to <unk> point higher but lagged gains in the <unk> market because of a shift in the shape of the <unk> yield curve and rumored mortgage sales by thrifts
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> securities with coupon rates of <unk> and higher actually declined amid concerns about increased prepayments because of a plan being considered by <unk> to speed the refinancing of government - subsidized mortgages
<unk> <unk> <unk> securities were down about <unk> at <unk> <unk>
if the refinancing plan clears <unk> there could be fairly heavy prepayments on the premium securities hurting any investor paying much above par for them
in the current - coupon sector a shift in the <unk> yield curve resulting from the better performance of long - dated issues over short - dated securities hurt major coupons because it will become more difficult to structure new derivative securities offerings
<unk> <unk> <unk> securities ended at <unk> <unk> up <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> n securities were at <unk> <unk> up <unk>
the <unk> <unk> <unk> issue was yielding <unk> to a n average life assumption as the spread above the <unk> <unk> note widened <unk> percentage point to <unk>
while <unk> issuance may slow in the coming days because of the shift in the <unk> yield curve underwriters continued to crank out new real estate mortgage investment conduits structured when the yield curve was more favorable
two new remics totaling n million were announced by <unk> <unk> yesterday
foreign
british government bonds ended little changed as investors awaited an economic policy address last night by <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
the <unk> <unk> <unk> bond due <unk> was down n at <unk> <unk> to yield n while the <unk> <unk> notes due n were unchanged at <unk> <unk> to yield n
in <unk> the bellwether no . n n bond of <unk> ended off n at n to yield <unk> and in <unk> <unk> the <unk> benchmark issue due <unk> <unk> ended <unk> point lower at n to yield n
the <unk> approaches makes his pitch
it may be straightforward he wants money for food or incredibly convoluted his sister is at this very moment near death in <unk> he has lost his wallet and has only <unk> in change n to put toward a bus ticket costing <unk> and wo n't you give him the difference
no
well how about a loan he take your name and address
figuring that their money would more likely go toward a bottle of <unk> <unk> <unk> most people have little trouble saying no to propositions like this
but healthy skepticism vanishes when they are solicited by an organized charity to help fight cancer famine child abuse or what have you
most see little reason n to doubt that their cash will go toward these noble goals
but will it
in a distressing number of cases no
in fact the donors sometimes might be better off giving the money to the panhandler at least he has no overhead and he might even be telling the truth
last year more than <unk> billion was donated to the nation n charities
while the vast bulk of it was indeed spent by reputable organizations on the good works n it was raised for it equally true that a sizable hunk was consumed in expenses claimed by other operators including fraudulent expenses
in many cases the costs claimed were so high that only a dribble of cash was left for the purported beneficiaries
it impossible to say exactly how much of the total charity intake is devoured by stratospheric fund - raising costs high - living operators and downright fraud
but the problem clearly is widespread and persistent
state law enforcers can barely keep up with charity scams and reports from watchdog groups such as the <unk> of <unk> <unk> bureaus are not encouraging
the <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> reviews hundreds of new charities every year measuring them against minimum standards for accountability for accuracy and honesty in solicitation and for percentage of funds actually going to work for which the charity was supposedly established
the <unk> figures n at least half of the money taken in should be spent on program
roughly a third of the charities reviewed flunk the test
which it should be added does n't prevent the charities from raking in a lot of money anyway
without a microscope and a subpoena it often hard to sort out worthwhile causes from ripoffs if all n you got n to go on is the solicitation itself
on this basis there no way n the average person can know a good charity from a bad one says <unk> <unk> <unk> an assistant attorney general in <unk>
a lot of donors just get taken
including those he contends who put about n million into the kitty for the <unk> <unk> of <unk> veterans and the <unk> veterans <unk> <unk>
the state has sued these charities in state court complaining that much of the money was grossly misspent <unk> says <unk> <unk> went to fund raisers and most of the rest to the people who ran the charities and to their relatives for fur coats trips to <unk> <unk> restaurant tabs
the telephone number for the charity in <unk> <unk> has been disconnected and the former officials could n't be located
running a charity does cost money but reputable organizations manage to get the lion share of donations out to where they are really needed
the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of <unk> all say that they spend roughly n of their income on programs not overhead
with some other charities however it s the other way around
the fledgling <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for example took in n million last year to finance bone - marrow transplants for children
by the time n it paid its expenses it only had n left not enough to treat even one child
the state of <unk> is suing the charity for fraud in <unk> along with <unk> <unk> <unk> its <unk> - based fund raiser
both deny wrongdoing
the charity admits spending a lot on fund raising but says <unk> that was necessary to establish a donor base n it can tap at much lower cost in years <unk> to come
<unk> <unk> president of <unk> says <unk> his concern has only benefited from the publicity surrounding the case noting that three other charities have signed on as clients because they were impressed with the amount n he raised for <unk> <unk>
meanwhile a state court judge has allowed the charity to go on soliciting funds
enforcers ca n't put charities out of business simply because they spend the lion share of their income on fund raising
state laws previously used as a yardstick minimum percentages of income usually half that had to be spent on the program rather than overhead but these have been overturned by the <unk> <unk> <unk>
it has ruled that such laws might work to stifle fund raising which would amount to limiting the charities first - amendment right to freedom of expression
this puts upon enforcers the burden of proving outright fraud or misrepresentation and such actions have been brought against hundreds of charities recently
the attorney general office in <unk> alone has put seven of them out of business over the past couple of years and the enforcement drive is continuing there and elsewhere
in making cases the authorities frequently zero in on alleged misrepresentations made by the charities fund raisers
<unk> for instance currently has under investigation n of the <unk> companies drumming up funds for charities soliciting there
enforcers pay special attention to operators using sweepstakes prizes as an additional inducement to give
attorneys general in several states including <unk> are already suing <unk> <unk> <unk> an <unk> <unk> outfit that they say <unk> has used deceptive sweepstakes ads to solicit donations for the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of <unk>
according to the <unk> attorney general suit <unk> <unk> sent mailings indicating that recipients were guaranteed cash prizes and could win up to an additional n on top of them if they contributed as little as n
but the total value of the prizes was only n and most winners will receive just n cents according to the attorney general office
the suit is still pending in <unk> state court
<unk> <unk> has denied the allegations in court officials decline to comment further
while they can target some of the most obvious miscreants enforcers concede that they are only scratching the surface
there are so many cunning ploys used by so many dubious operators they say <unk> that it is probably impossible to stop them all
one maneuver the public education gambit
the solicitation material indicates that donations will go toward a campaign alerting and informing the public about some health or other issue
what it does n't say is that the entire campaign may be the fund - raising letter itself
all too often this will merely be a statement on the solicitation such as do n't smoke or wear suntan lotion says <unk> <unk> attorney general of <unk>
by putting these pithy statements on the solicitations hundreds of thousands of dollars are claimed to have been spent on education to consumers when in fact this represents the costs of sending the newsletters
<unk> <unk> cites a four - page mailing from the <unk> <unk> <unk> that offers a chance to win <unk> in gold bullion to those giving as little as n to cancer education
a few boilerplate warnings about cancer appear but that only two inches in all four pages
i think n some people may believe <unk> they helping fund a massive tv and print campaign but we could n't find that the charity does anything except write these letters he says
officials at the <unk> d.c.-based charity did n't return repeated phone calls
many fly - by-night charities ride the coattails of the biggest best - known and most reputable ones by adopting names similar to theirs
the established charities are bothered by this but say n they can do little about it
we ca n't police the many organizations that have sprung up in the last few years using part of our name
most of them do n't last for long but in the meantime all n we can do is tell people n they are n't connected with us says a spokeswoman for the <unk> <unk> <unk>
and sometimes a reputable charity with a household name gets used and does n't even know it
a couple in <unk> <unk> raised n earlier this year using the name and logo of mothers against <unk> driving without permission from the group
<unk> did n't learn of the fund raising until the couple sent it a check for n along with a letter saying n that was the charity share
the <unk> <unk> <unk> won a court order to prevent the couple from raising further funds without <unk> permission
the couple could n't be reached for comment and apparently have left <unk> law enforcement officials report n
<unk> <unk> a spokeswoman for <unk> says it scary because anybody could do this

<unk> <unk> <unk> a crucial participant in the proposed buy - out of <unk> <unk> washed its hands of the current efforts to revive a bid for the parent of <unk> <unk>
specifically the british carrier said <unk> it currently has no plans to participate in any new offer for <unk>
in addition british <unk> officially withdrew its support for the previous <unk> bid in a terse statement that said the original deal is closed
company officials said later that <unk> <unk> believes n its involvement in the <unk> buy - out ended last <unk> when the buy - out group which also includes <unk> management and pilot union failed to obtain financing for the <unk> billion transaction
the carrier stopped short of saying n it would n't at some point reconsider participating in any new bid for <unk>
however company officials said n they plan to take no initiatives to resurrect the transaction and are n't aware of any restructured bid in the making
collectively the statements raised questions about whether a new bid for <unk> will ever get off the ground
the transaction has had a series of setbacks since the financing problems became known last <unk> with no signs or statements from the buy - out group n to indicate that any progress has taken place
however in response to the british <unk> decision <unk> pilot union vowed to continue efforts to revive the buy - out
pilot union <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> advisers to <unk> management and the union will begin meeting in <unk> <unk> today and will work through the weekend to devise a new proposal <unk> to present to <unk> board at the earliest time possible
pilot union advisers appeared confident that a new bid could go forward even without british <unk> participation
<unk> declined to comment on british <unk> statement
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who is leading the management end of the buy - out has n't provided investors with any assurances about the prospect of a new deal
in another setback yesterday <unk> machinist union asked the <unk> <unk> to investigate whether certain aspects of the original buy - out proposal violated tax laws
in an effort to derail the buy - out the union has already called for investigations by the securities and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
but there was one bright spot yesterday
the <unk> flight - attendants union agreed to negotiations that could lead to the flight attendants contributing concessions to a revived bid in exchange for an ownership stake
the pilot union the only one n to support the buy - out thus far said <unk> the flight attendants decision enforces our belief that an all - employee owned airline is practical and achievable
still without the assurance of <unk> airways financial backing it will be tougher for the buy - out group to convince already - reluctant banks to make loan commitments for a revised bid especially since british <unk> original investment represented <unk> of the cash equity contribution for the bid
under the previous plan british <unk> would have received a <unk> stake in <unk> in exchange for a n million equity investment with a <unk> stake going to <unk> employees and n to <unk> management
british <unk> officials said n the airline chairman <unk> <unk> was concerned about news reports indicating that british <unk> might be willing to participate in a bid that included a lower purchase price and better investment terms for the british carrier
the previous reports were based on remarks by british <unk> chief financial officer <unk> <unk> who said <unk> any revised bid would have to include a lower purchase price to reflect the sharp drop in <unk> stock in the past week
<unk> stock dropped <unk> yesterday to <unk> on volume of n shares in composite trading on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> declined to comment on british <unk> statement
in an interview <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said we in no way committed to a deal going through at all
we not rushing into anything
we do n't want to be party to a second rejection
indeed british <unk> seemed to be distancing itself from the troubled transaction early in an effort to avoid any further embarrassment
the original transaction fell through on the same day n british <unk> shareholders approved the plan at a special meeting after the british succeeded in arranging the financing for its equity contribution
the carrier also seemed eager to place blame on its american counterparts
the buy - out consortium ceased to exist because our american partners were not capable of organizing the financing a <unk> <unk> spokesman said
<unk> airways may have begun to have second thoughts about the transaction after the <unk> <unk> forced <unk> airlines new owners to restructure the equity contribution of <unk> <unk> <unk> airlines in that carrier
most of the department statements since the <unk> transaction indicated n it planned to curtail foreign ownership stakes in <unk> carriers
even before british <unk> announcement pilot union leaders had been meeting in <unk> yesterday to consider their options
the leaders expressed support for trying to revive the bid following a briefing <unk> by the union advisers <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
they also unanimously re - elected <unk> <unk> the union chairman who has led the pilots <unk> <unk> fight to take control of the airline
<unk> advisers have indicated previously that it may take a while to come forward with a revised plan since they want to have firm bank commitments before launching a new bid
they have maintained that banks remain interested in financing the transaction
the buy - out fell through after <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> the lead banks in the transaction failed to obtain n billion in financing needed for the plan
<unk> industrial wholesale sales index rose <unk> in <unk> from a year earlier the state statistical institute <unk> said <unk>
the <unk> increase compared with a rise of n in <unk> from a year earlier
domestic wholesale sales rose n from a year earlier while foreign sales jumped <unk> <unk> said <unk>
for the first six months wholesale sales rose n from the year before reflecting to a <unk> jump in domestic sales and a <unk> boost in foreign sales
sales of capital goods to foreign and domestic destinations increased n in the <unk> - <unk> period from a year earlier
sales of consumer goods rose n in the same period while sales of intermediate goods were up n from a year ago
<unk> democrats favoring a cut in the capital - gains tax have decided under pressure from their leaders not to offer their own proposal placing another obstacle in the path of <unk> <unk> legislative priority
a core group of six or so democratic senators has been working behind the scenes to develop a proposal to reduce the tax on the gain from the sale of assets
the plan was complete except for finishing touches and there was talk that it would be unveiled as early as yesterday
but <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a vigorous opponent of the capital - gains tax cut called the group to meet with him <unk> night and again yesterday
<unk> <unk> urged them to desist
afterward leaders of the dissident democrats relented and said n they would n't offer their own proposal as they had planned
the decision is a setback for <unk> <unk> who needs the support of democrats to pass the tax cut through the <unk> - controlled <unk>
having a proposal sponsored by democrats would have given the president an advantage
having only a republican measure makes the task harder
still <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the lead sponsor of the republican capital - gains amendment predicted that the tax cut would be enacted this year
he said <unk> a clear majority of senators back the tax reduction and that ultimately there would be enough senators n to overcome any procedural hurdle <unk> the democratic leadership might erect
but <unk> <unk> buoyed by his victory among fellow democrats strongly disagreed
<unk> <unk> has been predicting that the president initiative would fail this year
yesterday in an interview he added that the democrats decision increases the likelihood that a capital - gains tax cut will not pass this year
<unk> <unk> first victory came last week when the <unk> passed a deficit - reduction bill that did n't contain a capital - gains provision
that vote made it unlikely that a capital - gains tax cut would be included in the final bill now being drafted by <unk> and <unk> negotiators
the <unk> version of the bill does include the tax cut
now republican leaders are concentrating on attaching a capital - gains amendment to some other bill perhaps a measure raising the federal borrowing limit or a second tax bill that would follow on the heels of the deficit - reduction legislation
to help lay the groundwork for that fight <unk> <unk> plans early next week to meet at the <unk> <unk> with some <unk> democratic senators who favor cutting the capital - gains tax or are undecided on the issue
the president apparently will have only one bill <unk> to push <unk> <unk> and at least some of the dissident democrats plan to support it
i may want to offer additional amendments n to improve it when the bill comes to the floor said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a leader of those democrats
the <unk> plan as expected would allow individuals to exclude from income n of the gain from the sale of a capital asset held for more than one year
the exclusion would rise five percentage points for each year n the asset was held until it reached a maximum of <unk> after seven years
the exclusion would apply to assets sold after <unk> n
as an alternative taxpayers could chose to reduce their gains by an inflation index
for corporations the top tax rate on the sale of assets held for more than three years would be cut to <unk> from the current top rate of n
that rate would gradually decline to as little as <unk> for corporate assets held for n years
the <unk> plan also would include a proposal designed by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that would create new tax benefits for individual retirement accounts
the <unk> plan would create a new non - deductible <unk> from which money could be withdrawn tax - free not only for retirement but also for the purchase of a first home education expenses and medical expenses
current iras could be rolled over into the new iras but would be subject to tax though no penalty
<unk> <unk> <unk> realizing benefits of a sustained effort to cut costs and boost productivity reported sharply improved third - quarter results
the producer and marketer of low - sulfur coal said <unk> net income for the quarter was n million or n cents a share on revenue of n million
for the year - earlier period the company reported a loss of n or six cents a share
in the latest nine months the company earned n million or <unk> a share
last year net loss of n included a benefit of n from an accounting change
revenue for the nine months rose to n million from n million
in an interview <unk> <unk> president and chief executive cited several reasons for the improvement higher employee productivity and good natural conditions in the mines as well as lower costs for materials administrative overhead and debt interest
in the latest nine months <unk> <unk> said <unk> total coal sales rose to about n million tons from about n million tons a year earlier
in addition long - term debt has been trimmed to about n million from n million since <unk> n
he predicted n the debt ratio will improve further in coming quarters
<unk> strategy is to retain and expand its core business of mining and selling low - sulphur coal in the <unk> region
the operating territory includes coal terminals on the <unk> <unk> and in <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> exports about a fourth of its coal tonnage including a significant amount of metallurgical coal produced by others that is used by steelmakers overseas
for the past couple of years <unk> has undertaken an aggressive streamlining of all aspects of its business
marginal operations and assets have been sold
the size of the company board has been reduced to eight directors from <unk>
about <unk> salaried management jobs and hundreds of hourly wage positions have been eliminated
even perks have been reduced
for example the chief executive himself now pays <unk> of the cost of his health benefits the company used to pay n
i think n the ship is now righted the bilges are pumped and we are on course <unk> <unk> said of the restructuring program
much of what we set out to do is completed
but he cautioned that <unk> third quarter is typically better than the fourth so investors should n't just multiply the third quarter by four and assume <unk> the same rate of improvement can be sustained
one difference he said <unk> is that the fourth quarter has significantly fewer workdays because of holidays and the hunting season
i do n't want to give the impression that everybody can relax now he said
we have to keep working at improving our core business to stay efficient
it a process that never really ends
nevertheless <unk> <unk> predicted that <unk> would be solidly profitable for <unk> and that <unk> would bring more of the same
for all of <unk> the company reported an after - tax operating loss of <unk> on revenue of n million
an accounting adjustment made net income n million or n cents a share
in a move that complements the company basic strategy its <unk> <unk> <unk> unit is developing four coal - fired cogeneration plants with a partner in <unk>
some of the coal n the plants buy will come from <unk> mines
<unk> <unk> predicted that the unit contribution to company results in the n will be exciting
he said <unk> <unk> is looking at investment stakes in other cogeneration plants east of the <unk> <unk>
<unk> expects energy demand to grow annually in the n range in the early n

coal prices while not skyrocketing will grow modestly in real terms we think n
<unk> <unk> <unk> after trying unsuccessfully to sell its interest in its lower <unk> operations building has exercised its option to purchase the n office tower
<unk> had purchased an option to buy the building at one <unk> <unk> <unk> for an undisclosed sum from the late <unk> <unk> as part of its original lease in <unk>
the current transaction cost the bank approximately n million
of that amount n million was payment for the land underneath the building and the rest was for the building itself
the building houses about n <unk> workers most of whom will be moved to downtown <unk> after the bank new back office center is completed in <unk>
the move is part of <unk> strategy to consolidate its back offices under one roof
the headquarters is located a few blocks away at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
as part of its decision to leave the building <unk> tried to sell its interest along with the <unk> estate interest shortly after the <unk> n stock market crash
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> the bank decided to exercise its option after bids fell short of expectations
he said <unk> <unk> and the <unk> estate were looking to sell the entire building for n million to n million but did n't get an offer for more than n million
as the building new owner <unk> will have its work cut out for it
<unk> is vacating n million square feet of space and <unk> <unk> <unk> whose headquarters is in the building also plans to move shortly
in addition another major building tenant <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> likely will vacate the premises as part of its liquidation
<unk> <unk> real estate brokerage <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> will have the difficult task of finding new tenants
even with its striking views of the <unk> <unk> harbor the building is considered antiquated by modern office standards
and <unk> will have to spend approximately n million to remove asbestos from the premises
<unk> <unk> shake hands with <unk> <unk>
the author of the futuristic novel n invented a language called <unk> that made it impossible to fully develop a heretical thought that is anything negative about the policies and practices of the state
<unk> <unk> has n't gotten that far yet but it has made a promising start
its language call it <unk> is increasingly mellifluous reassuring and designed to make financial products and maneuvers appear better safer or cheaper than they really are
when something undeniably nasty happens a few euphemisms are deployed to simply make it disappear much as a fresh grave may be covered by a blanket of flowers
for example we bet <unk> you thought that the stock market crashed two years ago
wrong
according to some of the grand panjandrums of the market it never happened
in their lexicon the n collapse in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> n <unk> was just a big blip
trotting out a much - beloved <unk> term <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> recently declared that history would record the event as only a major technical correction
another much - beloved saying however this one in plain <unk> holds that if something walks like a duck and quacks like a duck it is a duck
on <unk> n <unk> a date n historians stubbornly insist on associating with the dreaded c - word the <unk> industrials fell n
in the technical correction of two years ago they lost a whopping n
customers hear a lot of this stuff from people who try to sell them stock
these people used to be called brokers but apparently this word either is not grandiose enough or carries too many negative connotations from the aforementioned technical correction when terrified customers could n't raise brokers on the phone
either way the word broker is clearly out of favor
of the major <unk> <unk> - based securities firms only <unk> <unk> <unk> still calls its salespeople brokers
at <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> they are financial consultants
at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> they are account executives
at <unk> <unk> they are investment executives
such titles are designed to convey a sense of dignified broad - scale competence and expertise in selling today myriad financial products
it is a competence and expertise that some brokers themselves overwhelmed by all the new things being dreamed up n for them to peddle do n't feel
it s almost product de jour grouses one account executive at <unk> <unk>
the transmogrified brokers never let the c - word cross their lips instead stressing such terms as safe insured and guaranteed even though these terms may be severely limited in their application to a particular new financial product
the names of some of these products do n't suggest the risk involved in buying them either
a case in point government - plus bond funds
what could imply more safety than investing in government bonds
what could be better than getting a tad more income from them the plus than other people
indeed conservative investors many of them elderly have poured more than n billion into such funds which promise fatter yields than ordinary <unk> bonds only to learn later that these funds use part of their money to dabble in high - risk bond options a gambler game
when a certain class of investment performs so poorly that its reputation is tarnished look for <unk> <unk> to give it a new moniker
this seems to be happening now to limited partnerships many of which either have gone into the tank in recent years or have otherwise been grievous disappointments
they are still being sold but more and more often as direct investments with all the same risks <unk> they had under the old label
in such cases the game has n't changed only the name
in others a familiar old name still prevails but the underlying game has changed
for example no load mutual funds remain a favorite with investors because they do n't carry a frontend sales commission
getting out of them however may be a different story now
traditional no - loads made their money by charging an annual management fee usually a modest one they imposed no other fees and many still do n't
in recent years though a passel of others flying the no - load flag have been imposing hefty charges all the way up to <unk> when an investor sells his shares
should n't they properly be called exit - load funds
the mutual - fund industry is debating the question but do n't expect a new name while the old one is working so well
and do n't expect anyone to change the term blue chip either even though some of the companies that still enjoy the title may be riskier investments than they were
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for one is still a favorite of widows orphans and trust departments but shorn of its regional telephone units and exposed to competition on every side it is a far different investment prospect than it was before divestiture
also blue chips in general have suffered much more short - term price volatility in recent years
<unk> <unk> a money manager in <unk> <unk> <unk> blames that on the advent of program trading in which computers used by big institutional investors are programmed to buy and sell big blocks when certain market conditions prevail
blue chips he says n are now being referred to as poker chips
finally even the time - honored strategy called value investing no longer means what it once did
before the takeover mania of the <unk> it referred to rooting out through analysis undervalued stocks especially those with shrewd management sound fundamentals and decent prospects
now says <unk> <unk> <unk> value investing often means looking for downtrodden companies with terrible management that are in real trouble
to institutional investors or brokers he adds n a company with value is a company at risk of being swallowed up
<unk> <unk> covers personal finance from the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> bureau
i was amused to read your recent news stories on the banking industry reserve additions and concomitant threats to cease making new loans to less - developed countries
if the whole story were told it would read something like this
during the n the commercial banks lured the country loan business away from the bond markets where the discipline of a prospectus and <unk> of proceeds confirmation allowed lenders to audit expenditures of old loans before new loans were made
the reward for that reckless lending was high reported earnings and management bonuses the price a sea of bad loans
for the past several years the banks lacking a private navy n to enforce their interests have been pressuring the <unk> <unk> to underwrite their bad <unk> credits
the <unk> wisely has refused but has concluded that indirect credit support through various multinational agencies should be made available for a price either debt reduction or debt - service reduction or new loans the <unk> <unk>
the banks will threaten not to make further loans but in truth lacking the capital <unk> to write off their mistakes or to build a navy they have no alternative but to go along
<unk> a.
<unk> <unk> elected <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman of <unk> <unk> <unk> to its board increasing the number of directors to <unk> from <unk>
<unk> <unk> earlier this year bought n million of preferred stock in <unk> that is convertible into an <unk> stake and <unk> said at the time that <unk> <unk> would be added to the board
separately <unk> said <unk> its third - quarter earnings rose n to n million or n cents a share from n million or n cents a share in the year - earlier period per - share earnings remained flat despite an increase in net income in part because the company paid a n million dividend on the new preferred stock in the period
sales rose <unk> to n million from n million with sales of the company international\/diversified operations well above the year earlier - period
for the nine months <unk> net income declined <unk> to n million or <unk> a share from n million or <unk> a share in the n period
sales rose <unk> to n billion from n billion
in composite trading on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the company closed yesterday at <unk> a share up n cents
when <unk> <unk> the president of <unk> <unk> <unk> records last month told producer <unk> <unk> that <unk> was about to make a n billion bid for <unk> pictures and needed someone <unk> to run the studio <unk> <unk> jumped at the chance
within two days he was on his way to <unk> <unk> and <unk> to meet with top brass at <unk>
and before the week was out <unk> had offered <unk> <unk> and his partner <unk> <unk> the most lucrative employment contracts in the history of the movie business
not only that <unk> also agreed to give them a stake in <unk> future profits and buy their company <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for n million almost n more than the market value of the company
there was just one sticking point the two had a prior commitment
just seven months earlier they had signed a five - year exclusive contract to make movies for <unk> <unk> for which they had just produced the smash hit <unk>
but <unk> <unk> figured that <unk> communications <unk> chairman <unk> <unk> would empathize and let the producers go knowing n the <unk> offer was the culmination of a life work
he figured wrong
last week following fruitless settlement talks <unk> now merging with <unk> <unk> filed a n billion breach of contract suit in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> against both <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> promptly countersued charging <unk> with trying to sabotage its acquisitions and hurt its efforts to enter the <unk> movie business
the accusations of lying and duplicity are flying thick and fast on both sides as one <unk> executive puts it it <unk> <unk> <unk>
that two successful producers who are n't all that well known outside <unk> could occasion such a clash of corporate titans suggests how desperate the quest for proven talent is in the movie business
and they are a very odd team in any case
<unk> <unk> was raised in <unk> and educated in <unk> <unk>
he is a lawyer with a string of academic degrees
<unk> <unk> is a high - school dropout who came to fame as <unk> <unk> hairdresser
yet they are far and away the most prolific producers in <unk>
and despite their share of duds they make movies that make money
that is a skill n <unk> badly needs and <unk> is loath to lose
although <unk> had a good summer with ghostbusters <unk> and when <unk> <unk> <unk> rivals such as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> have been thrashing <unk> at the box office
after five years of management turmoil with four different studio heads <unk> sorely needs a stable savvy team <unk> to restore its credibility and get it back in the business of making hits
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> are n't universally loved in <unk> but they are well connected
their stock in trade as executive producers is sniffing out hot properties locking them up and then getting big studios to bankroll and distribute them
sometimes <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> do little more than grab the first draft of a screenplay for a flashdance or buy rights to a best seller such as the <unk> <unk>
it falls to others to do the writing directing and producing
with <unk> <unk> for instance messrs. <unk> and <unk> had virtually nothing n to do with day - to-day production but their names still appear in big letters on the credits and they are inevitably associated with its success
sometimes as with <unk> the pair really do make the film
in that case <unk> <unk> acquired the rights in <unk> nursed the movie through a dozen scripts and were on the set in <unk> for n months hovering over the most minute changes in casting and production
they the best production talent around says <unk> <unk> <unk> beholden to <unk> <unk> for hiring him to direct the <unk> movie of <unk> <unk> novel bonfire of the vanities
on that film which is to start shooting in a few months they been very much involved hiring talent and discussing the development of the script
and when you making a movie this big you need all the help n you can get <unk> <unk> <unk> adds
i wish <unk> they were around n hours a day
and some movies seem to have been hurt by their inattention
<unk> executives blame <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> lack of involvement in <unk> <unk> for casting and production problems and the film ultimate dismal failure
we had a few bombs admits <unk> <unk>
but by and large this company has only been profitable
he says <unk> his company prowess at packaging and marketing is why we be good at <unk>
we practically ran our own studio
longtime <unk> associates describe <unk> <unk> as the intellectual powerhouse of the two a man with a flair for deal - making and marketing
<unk> is a major piece of <unk> manpower who has really earned his success says <unk> <unk> an agent at <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> the producer of <unk> chimes in he has a great ability to hire terrific people and delegate authority
it no accident that they been able to develop such successful material
<unk> <unk> on the other hand has fewer fans in <unk> and his detractors like to characterize him as something of a hot - tempered bully
he gets better reviews as a creative whiz an enthusiast an idea man
he also had to fight harder for credibility than his partner did
<unk> <unk> made him famous
he cut her hair
he lived with her
he came to produce her records and her movies a <unk> is born and the <unk> event
thrice married but now single <unk> <unk> got plenty of ink last summer for an on - set romance with actress <unk> <unk> during the making of <unk>
<unk> <unk> by contrast has been married to one woman for more than n years
but for all their intellectual and stylistic differences they make the perfect good cop bad cop team <unk> associates say n
<unk> is the bright sympathetic guy when you doing a deal says one agent
if there a problem <unk> disappears and all of a sudden <unk> shows up
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> rub many people in <unk> the wrong way
producers <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> who shepherded flashdance through several scripts and ultimately produced the movie bristle when messrs. <unk> and <unk> take credit for the film
says <unk> <unk> the script was unreadable
we reinvented it
we are the producers of that movie
they got a small piece of the net profits and a screen credit as executive producers
when <unk> <unk> an executive who worked for <unk> <unk> in the early n left to take a job as head of production at the <unk> <unk> studio they made him forfeit all credits and financial interest in the films <unk> he had helped develop including <unk> and <unk>
<unk> <unk> acknowledges that and says n it not unlike the situation n he and <unk> <unk> are in with <unk>
i was upset with <unk> i fumpered and schmumpered says <unk> <unk>
but he wanted to pursue his own dream and he went
still <unk> <unk> says <unk> his relationship with <unk> <unk> was one of the most successful <unk> i had in <unk>
the two have a wonderful chemistry <unk> is very impulsive and <unk> is very compulsive adds <unk> <unk> <unk> who is now head of production at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> will come barreling into a room say n he got a great idea and be gone
<unk> will take the kernel of that idea and make it grow into something specific
<unk> <unk> recalls that <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> shifted into high gear a few years back upon learning that they had competition for the story of the murdered naturalist <unk> <unk> which became <unk> in the <unk>
he says within a few weeks we made deals with the government of <unk> and everyone who had ever met or talked to <unk> <unk>
i think n <unk> even made some deals with the gorillas
<unk> <unk> was working on a competing film but the studio and its producers ultimately agreed to co - produce the film with <unk> <unk> and <unk>
more recently <unk> <unk> beat out a dozen other producers reportedly including <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> for rights to the life story of <unk> <unk> the murdered brazilian union leader who fought developers in the <unk> rain forest
messrs. <unk> and <unk> assiduously courted the man widow for months showing her a tape of <unk> in the <unk> to impress her with the quality of their work
money helped too
ultimately they paid more than n million for the rights
the sale caused a rift between the widow and some of her husband followers
some of the money will go to the <unk> <unk> <unk> but it is n't earmarked for groups trying to save the rain forest
it hardly astonishing given the men track record that <unk> wants <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
but it is puzzling to some <unk> executives that <unk> rushed to hire them without clearing up the <unk> situation first
some note that <unk> might have saved itself some trouble by just hiring <unk> <unk> and letting <unk> <unk> stay on to fulfill the <unk> contract
but though people in town may ask why <unk> needs <unk> it good to have a partner and obviously the chemistry works says <unk> <unk> <unk> a producer who once worked for <unk> <unk>
this business is n't about personalities at the end of the day it s about whether the ink is red or black
in the case of <unk> and <unk> the ink has been very very black
<unk> <unk> got his start in the movie business at <unk> two decades ago
recruited from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> program he rose within two years to head of production overseeing such films as the way n we were <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
in <unk> he teamed up with record producer <unk> <unk> in <unk> records and filmworks later called <unk> <unk> where they produced such hits as as the <unk> and <unk> <unk>
in <unk> <unk> <unk> got together with <unk> <unk> by then a successful producer in his own right after the death of <unk> <unk>
while <unk> <unk> produced a number of hits for <unk> and others their record was n't always so impressive
among their clinkers were the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
and the failures make it possible for <unk> in its current lawsuit to paint the producers as ingrates
the studio says n it stuck with them even in the early years when the creative partnership was not particularly profitable for <unk>
<unk> <unk> replies that this is a <unk> this <unk> <unk> trying to chew up two fellows who have done only well for them for a long period of time
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> maintain that executives at <unk> have always known of their ambitions to run a major entertainment powerhouse but that <unk> never felt threatened until they linked up with <unk>
from the beginning they knew <unk> we had a goal and a dream says <unk> <unk>
on a number of occasions he adds n he tried to get <unk> to buy <unk> <unk> outright
they always listened but they never acted <unk> <unk> says
in <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> contributed their company assets in exchange for a <unk> stake in <unk> <unk> a small - fry tv production company controlled by <unk> industries <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
in <unk> a year later <unk> agreed to release the producers from their old contract when <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> made a n million offer to buy <unk> of <unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> planned to run the nearly dormant <unk> studio and the two even tried to interest <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in becoming a partner after he advised them on the deal
but the <unk> plan collapsed just two weeks later
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> say <unk> they got a look at the books and balked at the price
their relationship with <unk> <unk> soured shortly thereafter
last <unk> he sold his <unk> stake in <unk> to a passive australian investor and <unk> was renamed <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
meanwhile <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> had agreed to extend their <unk> agreement with the new five - year exclusive contract
the new deal was considered the most generous of its kind both financially and in terms of creative freedom
but it paled by comparison to what <unk> was to offer last month the chance at last to run a major studio about n million in deferred compensation up to <unk> of <unk> future cash flow <unk> of the future appreciation of <unk> market value and annual salaries of n million for each
the producers <unk> share of publicly held <unk> <unk> would net them an additional n million
<unk> also agreed to indemnify the producers against any liability to <unk>
<unk> is paying a hefty price for a company that had revenue of only n million last year
and earnings have been erratic
in the the latest quarter thanks in part to <unk> <unk> <unk> earned n million or n cents a share compared to a loss of n million or n cents a share in last year quarter
<unk> <unk> stock which traded as low as <unk> a share last year closed yesterday at <unk>
the two sides now are accusing each other of lying
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> claim <unk> they have an oral agreement with <unk> executives that allows them to terminate their contract should the opportunity to run a major studio arise
but in affidavits filed yesterday in the <unk> <unk> court <unk> <unk> <unk> bros. <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> deny that such an oral agreement was ever made
<unk> in its court filings calls it a piece of fiction created for this litigation
<unk> <unk> in his affidavit acknowledges that <unk> agreed to release the producers last year to take over <unk> but says <unk> that situation was altogether different
for one thing according to <unk> <unk> the producers requested a release in advance
moreover the old contract was about to expire and the lineup of <unk> <unk> pictures for <unk> was n't as strong as it is now
<unk> itself was in negotiations with <unk> over certain movie and other rights and it was in <unk> interest to accommodate <unk> <unk> and <unk> by permitting them to become <unk> executives <unk> <unk> said in his affidavit
<unk> obviously does n't think that it is in its own interests to let <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> go off to <unk>
at the very least <unk> <unk> clearly sees an opportunity to use the two men to get a pound of flesh from <unk>
during settlement talks for example <unk> demanded such things as cable tv rights to <unk> movies and <unk> interest in the studio n it jointly owns with <unk> according to executives involved in the talks
in any settlement <unk> is almost certain to demand rights to most of the n or so projects n <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> have locked up for the next few years notably sequels to <unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> refuse to concede that they may have made a tactical error in accepting the <unk> offer before taking it up with <unk>
and they say n there are plenty of precedents in <unk> for letting people out of contracts
the last time <unk> <unk> pictures was looking for a studio chief they note <unk> <unk> released producer <unk> <unk> from his contract then took him back after he was subsequently fired by his bosses at <unk>
in his affidavit filed yesterday <unk> <unk> <unk> indicated n he is n't buying any such argument if <unk> succeeds here no written contract in <unk> will be worth the paper n it written on
the <unk> <unk> could n't sound better
first there the name asset - backed securities
better than all those offers n you get to buy securities backed by nothing
and there more
the assets backing the securities come from some of the country biggest and most secure institutions
most earn high ratings from credit agencies
their yields are higher than those of <unk> <unk> issues
and the booming market has already attracted many of the nation biggest institutional investors
ready to jump
well think twice
the concept may be simple take a bunch of loans tie them up in one neat package and sell pieces of the package to investors
but the simplicity may be misleading
skeptics say n the slightly higher returns are n't enough to compensate for the extra risk
they warn that asset - backed securities are only as good as the assets and credit backing that support them and those are hard n to evaluate
moreover the securities were introduced only about <unk> n years ago the biggest unknown is how they will fare in a recession
a lot of this stuff really is in untested waters says <unk> <unk> director of the investment securities division of the <unk> comptroller of the currency
we do n't know how this whole market will work in a serious economic downturn
such concerns however have n't stopped asset - backed securities from becoming one of <unk> <unk> hottest new products
since the spring of <unk> financial alchemists have transformed a wide variety of debt into these new securities
they have sold issues backed by car loans boat loans and recreational - vehicle loans
they have offered bundles of homeequity loans as well as packages of loans used to buy vacation time - shares
last year there was an issue of death - backed bonds securities backed by loans to life - insurance policyholders
some predict n there will be third <unk> bonds backed by loans to <unk> <unk> and other debt - ridden nations
and the biggest volume this year has been on securities backed by credit - card receivables sometimes known as plastic bonds
this is the heyday of debt says <unk> <unk> editor of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a newsletter
before the sun sets on the n it seems <unk> nothing will be left unhocked
the result is a n billion market according to <unk> <unk> <unk>
that includes more than <unk> billion issued through <unk> of this year up sharply from <unk> billion in the comparable n period and more than in all of <unk>
most issues have been sold to professional money managers pension funds bank trust departments and other institutions
but wealthy individuals also have been jumping in and lately brokers have been pushing smaller investors into the asset - backed market
the entry fee is affordable issues typically are sold in minimum denominations of n
we expect additional offerings of asset - backed securities targeted toward individual investors says <unk> <unk> <unk> a senior vice president at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the process typically begins when an institution such as <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> takes a pool of credit - card or other receivables and sells them to a specially created trust
the trust then issues securities generally due in five years or less that are underwritten by <unk> <unk> brokerage firms and offered to investors
issues typically come with credit enhancements such as a bank letter of credit and thus have received high credit ratings
enthusiasts say n the booming market has opened up a valuable new source of funds to issuers while providing a valuable new investment for individuals and institutions
<unk> - backed securities are an attractive investment compared to bank certificates of deposit or other corporate bonds says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> managing director and head of the asset - backed securities group at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
but skeptics question whether asset - backed bonds offer sufficient rewards n to compensate for the extra risks
consider a n million offering of <unk> securities issued last spring and backed by <unk> credit - card receivables
the triple - a-rated issue offered a yield of only about n percentage point above four - year <unk> issues
on a n investment that a difference of only <unk> a year
that kind of spread can be critical for money managers who buy bonds in large quantities and whose livelihood depends on outperforming the money manager across the street
but for individuals who buy much smaller amounts and care less about relative performance than in preserving what they have that margin is meaningless
if you in the bond business playing the relative - performance derby then even an extra n basis points <unk> percentage point becomes an important consideration on a career basis says <unk> <unk>
but if you an individual investing money and trying to get it back again then that is n't of overwhelming importance
moreover the interest on asset - backed securities is fully taxable while interest on <unk> issues is tax - free at the state and local level
that why some investment managers such as <unk> <unk> a vice president of <unk> <unk> <unk> private banking division do n't recommend most asset - backed issues for individuals in high - tax states such as <unk> <unk> or <unk>
but <unk> <unk> has purchased asset - backed issues for individuals with tax - deferred accounts such as retirement plans
he points out that institutions buying asset - backed issues in large quantities can earn higher spreads over treasurys than individuals buying smaller amounts
another concern is liquidity or how easily a security can be converted into cash
the secondary or resale market for asset - backed securities is relatively new and much less active than for <unk> issues
that could make it tricky for investors who need to sell their holdings quickly before the securities mature
that particularly true analysts say n for certain of the securities such as those backed by time - share loans
you could see massive gyrations here because it such a thinly traded market says <unk> <unk> <unk> a vice president of <unk> investors <unk> a <unk> <unk> investment - management firm
in addition an investor who wants to know the daily value of <unk> bonds or corporate bonds traded on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> can simply check newspaper listings
there are n't any such listings for asset - backed securities
evaluating asset - backed securities poses another problem
investors for instance may mistakenly assume that the bank or company that originally held the assets is guaranteeing the securities
it is n't
the front cover of the prospectus for the <unk> credit - card receivables offering points out in bold capital letters that the certificates represent an interest only in the specially created trust and do not represent interests in or obligations of the banks <unk> <unk> <unk> or any affiliate thereof
in other words if there a problem do n't expect <unk> to come to the rescue
the prospectus also notes that the securities are not guaranteed by any government agency
that means n investors have to focus on the quality of the debt that lies beneath the securities as well as on the credit enhancement for the issue and the credit ratings n the issue has received
that also is n't easy
take the credit enhancements which typically include a bank letter of credit or insurance from a bond - insurance company
the letter of credit typically is not offered by the bank selling the assets <unk> to back the securities
nor does it cover the entire portfolio
details of credit enhancements vary widely from issue to issue
still they play a crucial role in winning top ratings for most asset - backed issues which in turn is why the yield above treasurys is so slim
but skeptics ask why you should bother buying this stuff when you can get only slightly lower yields on government - guaranteed paper
when you buy an asset - backed issue you take the risk that a bank or an insurer could run into unexpected difficulties
if a bank credit rating was lowered because of say its loans to <unk> <unk> nations that could also affect the ratings liquidity and prices of the asset - backed issues that the bank supports
underwriters insist <unk> these issues are constructed to withstand extremely tough economic conditions
but despite the credit enhancements despite the high ratings some money managers still worry that a recession could wreak havoc on the underlying assets
at a time when americans are leveraged to their eyeballs asset - backed investors may be taking a heady gamble that consumers will be able to repay loans in hard times
at the very least a recession would prompt investors to buy the highest - quality bonds n they can find that is treasurys
that could widen the yield spread between treasurys and asset - backed securities as well as make it tougher to unload the latter
but it could be much worse
some analysts are especially wary of credit - card issues
for one thing credit - card loans are unsecured
in addition they fear that banks have been overeager to issue cards to the public giving cards to too many big spenders who will default during a recession
a day of reckoning is coming where we think n the market will place a high premium on the highest - quality debt issues and therefore we think n the best debt investment is <unk> government bonds says <unk> <unk> of <unk> futures <unk> an investment advisory firm
what about triple - a-rated asset - backed issues
nope we still say to stick with treasurys <unk> <unk> replies
ratings he notes n are subject to change
all this makes asset - backed securities seem too risky for many people
and it reminds <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a market strategist at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of what he calls <unk> <unk> but highly probable theory no . n
more money has been lost reaching for yield than in all the stock speculations scams and frauds of all time

if you force financial planners to sum up their most important advice in a single sentence it would probably be a one - word sentence diversify
judging by a poll of <unk> <unk> <unk> readers conducted this summer by <unk> <unk> <unk> serious investors have taken that advice to heart
nearly n investors responded to the <unk> poll providing an in - depth look at their portfolios
those portfolios are remarkably diversified
by spreading their wealth among several investment alternatives the respondents have protected themselves against squalls in any one area be it stocks bonds or real estate
for example about <unk> of <unk> readers owned stock down slightly from <unk> in a similar poll last year
but only <unk> said n they had more than half their money in the stock market
similarly n of respondents own shares in a money - market mutual fund and n own municipal bonds
but only <unk> to n of the investors were committing more than half their funds to either of those alternatives
the poll conducted <unk> <unk> also provides a glimpse into the thinking of serious investors on a variety of other topics
it found them in a cautious but not downbeat mood
of n people sent a questionnaire n replied
the response rate more than <unk> allows the results to be interpreted with a high degree of confidence
the results ca n't be extrapolated to all investors though
<unk> readers are relatively affluent with a median household income of between <unk> and <unk>
nearly half of the respondents <unk> said <unk> their investment portfolio was worth <unk> or more and <unk> said n it was worth n million or more
the respondents were mildly optimistic about the economy and investment markets but their collective judgments were a notch more sober than they were a year ago
for example n of this year respondents said <unk> they expect a recession within <unk> months
last year only n were expecting a recession
an additional n of this year respondents expect the economy to slow down during the next n months
only n of last year respondents anticipated slowing growth
apparently the respondents do n't think that an economic slowdown would harm the major investment markets very much
a slim majority n think n stock prices will be higher in <unk> n than they were in <unk> <unk>
their verdict on real estate is almost the same
some n expect real estate in their local area to increase in value over the next n months
by contrast only n expect an increase in the price of gold
since gold tends to soar when inflation is high that finding suggests that people believe <unk> inflation remains under control
even though only <unk> actually predicted a recession many respondents were taking a better - safe-than sorry investment stance
nearly a third said n they have made some portfolio changes to anticipate a possible recession
for the most part the changes were slight
the two - thirds who have n't tried to make their portfolios more recession - resistant were split about evenly between investors who do n't believe in trying to predict the markets about <unk> and investors who do n't expect a recession about <unk> or are unsure if and when a recession might come about <unk>
a buy - and-hold approach to stocks continues to be the rule among respondents
most own two to n stocks and buy or sell no more than three times a year
some n had bought some stock in the past year only <unk> had sold any
but the lurking shadow of <unk> stock - market crash still seems dark
about n considered another crash likely while about <unk> said n one is unlikely
those percentages hardly changed from the previous year poll
and the respondents commitment to the stock market remains somewhat lighter than usual
about n of them said n they would ordinarily have at least <unk> of their money in stocks
but as of <unk> only <unk> actually had stock - market investments of that size
most stock - market indexes were hitting all - time highs at around the time of the poll
but it appears that many <unk> readers were taking that news as a sign to be cautious rather than a signal to jump on the bandwagon

electronic theft by foreign and industrial spies and disgruntled employees is costing <unk> companies billions and eroding their international competitive advantage
that was the message delivered by government and private security experts at an all - day conference on corporate electronic espionage
hostile and even friendly nations routinely steal information from <unk> companies and share it with their own companies said <unk> <unk> <unk> a former staffer at the federal <unk> <unk> <unk> and now president of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
it may well be that theft of business data is as serious a strategic threat to national security as it is a threat to the survival of victimized <unk> firms said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> assistant director for <unk> <unk> affairs
the conference was jointly sponsored by the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> forces <unk> and <unk> <unk> a joint industry - government trade group
any secret can be pirated the experts said n if it is transmitted over the air
even rank amateurs can do it if they spend a few thousand dollars for a commercially available microwave receiver with amplifier and a vcr recorder
they need only position themselves near a company satellite dish and wait
you can have a dozen competitors stealing your secrets at the same time <unk> <unk> said adding it a pretty good bet n they wo n't get caught
the only way n to catch an electronic thief he said <unk> is to set him up with erroneous information
even though electronic espionage may cost <unk> firms billions of dollars a year most are n't yet taking precautions the experts said n
by contrast european firms will spend n million this year on electronic security and are expected to spend n billion by n
already many foreign firms especially banks have their own cryptographers conference speakers reported <unk>
still encrypting corporate communications is only a partial remedy
one expert whose job is so politically sensitive that he spoke on condition that he would n't be named or quoted said n the expected influx of east european refugees over the next few years will greatly increase the chances of computer - maintenance workers for example doubling as foreign spies
moreover he said technology now exists for stealing corporate secrets after they been erased from a computer memory

the soviets eavesdropping paid off however because they got the contract
the <unk> of <unk> stepped deeper into the contest for <unk> <unk> <unk> by reaching an unusual agreement with <unk> - <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
the <unk> said <unk> the two companies agreed to spend n million canadian dollars n million over n years on research at canadian universities if they are successful in acquiring the vaccine maker

the <unk> is seeking an injunction against the <unk> bid arguing that <unk> predecessor company agreed in <unk> that <unk> ownership would n't be transferred to foreigners
the university implied that it would drop its opposition to foreign ownership if <unk> - <unk> and <unk> are successful with their lower bid
it said n the new agreement would replace the old one that forms the basis of its suit against the <unk> takeover

row n of section n of the <unk> <unk> at <unk> <unk> is a lofty perch only a few steps from the very top of the stands
from my orange seat i looked over the first - base line and the new - mown ball field in the warm sun of the last few minutes before what was to have been the third game of the <unk> <unk>
it was five in the afternoon but that was <unk> time
back in <unk> <unk> the work day was already over so i did n't have to feel guilty
even still i did feel self - indulgent and i could n't help remembering my father contempt for a rich medical colleague who would go to watch the tigers on summer afternoons
this ballpark the <unk> was not a classic baseball stadium too symmetrical too much bald concrete
and it did n't have the crowded wild intimacy of <unk> <unk>
but i liked the easy friendliness of the people around me liked it that they brought their children found it charming that true citizens of the state of the future they had brought so many tvs and radios to stay in touch with electroreality at a live event
maybe it was their peculiar sense of history
the broadcasters were after all documenting the game ratifying its occurrence for millions outside the <unk>
why not watch or hear your experience historicized while you were living it
the day was saturated with the weight of its own impending history
long lines of people waited to buy special souvenir <unk> <unk> postcards with official postmarks
thousands of us had paid <unk> for the official souvenir book with its historical essays on <unk> trivia its historical photographs of great moments in <unk> past and its instructions in <unk> and <unk> for filling in the scorecard
<unk> lanzador
<unk> jonron
players ran out on the field way below and the stands began to reverberate
it must be a local custom i thought <unk> stamping feet to welcome the team
but then the noise turned into a roar
and no one was shouting
no one around me was saying anything
because we all were busy riding a wave
sixty thousand surfers atop a concrete wall waiting for the wipeout
only at the moment of maximum roll did i grasp what was going on
then i remembered the quake of <unk> which i experienced in <unk> <unk> in a second - story motel room
when the swaying of the building woke me up i reasoned that a i was in <unk> <unk> b the bed was moving c it must be a <unk> fingers bed that had short - circuited
then i noticed n the overhead light was swaying on its cord and realized what had happened
what should i do
get out of the possibly collapsing building to the parking lot
but the lot might split into crevasses so i had better stand on my car which probably was wider than the average crevasse
fortunately the quake was over before i managed to run out and stand naked on the hood
at the stick while the world shook i thought of that morning and then it struck me that this time was different
if i survived i would have achieved every journalist highest wish
i was an eyewitness of the most newsworthy event on the planet at that moment
what was my angle
how would i file
all these thoughts raced through my head in the <unk> seconds of the earthquake actual duration
the rest is of course history
the <unk> did n't fall
the real tragedies occurred elsewhere as we soon found out
but for a few minutes there relief abounded
a young mother found her boy who had been out buying a hotdog
the wall behind me was slightly deformed but the center had held
and most of us waited for a while for the game to start
then we began to file out to wait safely on terra firma for the opening pitch
it was during the quiet exodus down the pristine concrete ramps of the <unk> that i really understood the point of all those <unk> and <unk>
the crowd moved in clumps clumps magnetized around an electronic nucleus
in this way while the <unk> itself was blacked out we kept up to date on events
within <unk> minutes of the quake itself i was able to see pictures of the collapsed section of the <unk> <unk>
increasingly accurate estimates of the severity of the quake became available before i got to my car
and by then expensive automobile sound systems were keeping the gridlocked parking lot by the bay informed about the fire causing the big black plume of smoke n we saw on the northern horizon
darkness fell
but the broadcasts continued through the blacked - out night with pictures of the sandwiched highway ganglion in <unk> and firefighting in the <unk> district
by then our little sand village of cars had been linked with a global village of listeners and viewers
everyone at the <unk> that day had started out as a spectator and ended up as a participant
in fact the entire population of the <unk> <unk> had ended up with this dual role of actor and audience
the reporters were victims and some of the victims turned into unofficial reporters
the outstanding example of this was the motorist on the <unk> <unk> who had the presence of mind n to take out a video camera at the absolutely crucial moment and record the car in front as it fell into the gap in the roadway
the tape was on tv before the night was out
<unk> <unk> you should have been there at that hour
investors who received <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> latest stock commentary may be left with blank expressions
the first <unk> pages of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are completely blank except for the page numbers
rather than printing devils <unk> puts all the blame on the unpredictable stock market
the plunge made <unk> market commentary instantly out of date
in fact last <unk> <unk> tumble in the stock market caught many people and businesses by surprise not the least of them brokerage firms such as <unk> that print their weekly market commentaries on fridays for dissemination the following week
<unk> a <unk> unit of <unk> <unk> <unk> did n't have enough time n to update its market commentary so we decided to kill our strategy pieces says <unk> <unk> the head of <unk> research department
the first thought n some investors had was that a red - faced <unk> must have been wildly bullish on stocks in its original commentary and that why it purged its pages
investors recalled that <unk> last week had been advising that the market is still exhibiting all the signs of a further advance
many other brokerage firms had similarly bullish views
but <unk> <unk> insists that the <unk> pages were n't pulled because they were too bullish
instead he says n they were cautious and that was n't the message n we wanted to deliver on <unk>
as <unk> <unk> explains it we were raising some caution flags about rate rises in <unk> and concerns about the lbo market
and by late <unk> afternoon actually after the close we decided <unk> that was the wrong tone <unk> to take
with the market down we wanted to tell people to put their orders in on the opening
both before and after the <unk> plunge <unk> has maintained a recommended portfolio weighting of <unk> stocks n bonds and n cash

<unk> slide toward recession is beginning to look like a free fall
in a report on <unk> foundering economy the official <unk> <unk> <unk> disclosed that industrial output last month rose n from a year earlier the lowest growth rate in a decade for <unk>
retail sales are plummeting while consumer prices still are rising
chinese and foreign economists now predict prolonged stagflation low growth and high inflation
the economy is crashing hard says an asian economist in <unk>
the slowdown is taking hold a lot more quickly and devastatingly than anyone had expected
a lengthy recession if it materializes would drain state coffers and create severe hardships for urban workers
experts predict n the coming year will be characterized by flat or negative industrial growth rising unemployment and a widening budget deficit
unless the government suddenly reverses course wages for most workers wo n't keep pace with inflation creating a potential source of urban unrest
the economy slowdown is due only partly to the austerity program launched in <unk> n to cool an overheated economy and tame inflation
industrial output surged <unk> in n while inflation peaked last <unk> at nearly n
the slowdown also results from chronic energy and raw - materials shortages that force many factories to restrict operations to two or three days a week
in western market - driven countries recessions often have a bright side prodding the economy to greater efficiency
in <unk> however there is n't likely to be any silver lining because the economy remains guided primarily by the state
instead <unk> is likely to shell out ever - greater subsidies to its coddled state - run enterprises which ate up n billion in bailouts last year
nor are any of these inefficient monoliths likely to be allowed to go bankrupt
rather the brunt of the slowdown will be felt in the fast - growing private and semi - private township enterprises which have fallen into disfavor as <unk> leaders re - emphasize an orthodox marxist preference for public ownership
when the going gets rough <unk> penalizes the efficient and rewards the incompetent says a western economist
reports of an economy near recession come as officials prepare a major <unk> <unk> plenum for sometime in the next few weeks
the meeting is expected to call for heightened austerity for two years
but with industrial growth stagnant and inflation showing signs of easing some voices may call for measures <unk> to pump new life into the economy
some analysts believe <unk> <unk> soon will begin relaxing economic controls particularly by loosening credit
that would benefit chinese enterprises as well as sino - foreign joint ventures both of which have been plagued by shortages of working capital
a dangerous buildup this year of billions of dollars in inter - company debts threatens if unchecked to bring the economy to a collapse
one sign of a possible easing of credit policy was the decision this week of <unk> <unk> of <unk> the central bank to allocate n billion in short - term loans to pay farmers for the autumn harvest the official <unk> <unk> reported <unk>
but while pumping more money into the economy would bring relief to many industries it also runs the risk of triggering another period of runaway growth and steep inflation
the cycle has been repeated several times since <unk> began reforming its planned economy in <unk>
and because <unk> leaders have abandoned plans to drastically reform the economy it is likely to continue analysts say n
the statistical bureau report cited in <unk> <unk> notes that industrial output in <unk> totaled n billion a rise of just n from a year earlier
output declined in several provinces including <unk> and <unk> two key coastal areas and sichuan the nation agricultural breadbasket
production in <unk> <unk> industrial powerhouse and the largest source of tax revenue for the central government fell <unk> for the month
nationwide output of light industrial products declined <unk> the first decline in <unk> years a bureau spokesman told <unk> <unk> <unk>
in an unusually direct statement the bureau spokesman recommended that state banks extend more credit to shopkeepers so that they can purchase manufacturers goods
this will prevent a slide in industrial production which will otherwise cause new panic buyings the spokesman said
the <unk> tax overhaul the biggest achievement of <unk> <unk> second term is beginning to fall apart and interest groups are lining up for tax goodies all over <unk> <unk>
real - estate executives are lobbying to ease anti - tax-shelter rules
charitable groups are trying to reinstate the write - off for contributions made by individuals who do n't itemize their deductions
big auction houses want to make collectibles eligible for lower capital - gains taxes
and heavy - industry lobbyists are quietly discussing the possibility of reinstating the investment tax credit
everything is up for grabs says <unk> <unk> a lobbyist for mutual life - insurance companies
adds <unk> <unk> the head lobbyist for a variety of interests that want to protect the tax deduction for travel and entertainment expenses it appears as though the whole thing is wide open again
the catalyst has been the congressional move to restore preferential tax treatment for capital gains an effort that is likely to succeed in this <unk>
other fundamental reforms of the <unk> act have been threatened as well
the <unk> seriously considered raising the top tax rate paid by individuals with the highest incomes
the <unk> <unk> <unk> voted to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts and also to bring back income averaging for farmers a tax preference that allows income to be spread out over several years
as part of the same bill the finance panel also voted in favor of billions of dollars in narrow tax breaks for individuals and corporations in what committee member <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> calls a feeding frenzy of special - interest legislating
the beneficiaries would range from pineapple growers to rich grandparents to tuxedo - rental shops
to be sure the full <unk> facing a fast - approaching budget deadline last <unk> stripped away all of the tax breaks that were contained in the <unk> <unk> bill
but lawmakers of both parties agree that the streamlining was temporary
other bills will be moving soon that are expected to carry many of the tax cuts including both the capital - gains and <unk> provisions
there is n't any doubt that the thread of the <unk> code has been given a mighty tug says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
you see the annual unraveling of it
it back to tax - give-away time for the select few says <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> the third - ranking <unk> in the <unk>
referring to the chairmen of the <unk> and <unk> tax - writing committees he adds next year every special - interest group is going to be there knocking on <unk> <unk> door on <unk> <unk> door
many groups are n't waiting that long
just last week a <unk> ways and means subcommittee held a lengthy meeting to hear the pleas of individual cities companies and interest groups who want to open their own special loopholes
it a swiss - cheese factory and the cheese smells pretty good commented one veteran lobbyist who was watching the proceedings
even lobbyists for heavy industry one of the interests hit hardest in the <unk> bill are encouraged
the return of pro - investment tax breaks such as those for capital gains and iras creates more of a mood or a mindset that is helpful for getting better depreciation write - offs or investment credits says <unk> <unk> <unk> a vice president for the <unk> <unk> of manufacturers
corporate lobbyist <unk> <unk> is planning a spring conference n to discuss what tax changes to make to improve competitiveness
in reaction to proposed capital - gains legislation groups are lobbying to make sure n they are n't left off the gravy train
real - estate interests for example are protesting an omission in <unk> <unk> capital - gains proposal it does n't include real - estate gains
if there is going to be a tax scheme that contemplates lower treatment of capital gains they certainly want to be part of it says real - estate lobbyist <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
in the <unk> - passed tax bill <unk> <unk> got his wish real - estate assets are included in the capital - gains provision
but <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> are still trying to get theirs
they have sent a letter to congressional tax - writers asking that gains from the sale of collectibles also be given preferential treatment
collectibles should continue to be recognized as capital assets the letter states
all of this talk is antithetical to the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>
in exchange for dramatically lower tax rates the framers of that legislation sought to eliminate most of the exemptions deductions and credits that gave some taxpayers an advantage over others
the goal was to tax people with roughly equivalent incomes equally and to eliminate the many shelters that allowed the wealthy to escape taxes
two of the major ways that tax - writers managed to attain these ends were to scrap the preferential treatment of capital gains and to curtail the use of paper losses also known as passive losses that made many tax shelters possible
many other tax benefits also were swept away
this year <unk> with prodding from <unk> <unk> has been busy trying to put many of these same tax preferences back into the code
it appears likely that this year or next some form of capital - gains preference and passive - loss restoration will be enacted
other tax benefits probably will be restored and created
the main obstacle is finding a way <unk> to pay for them
the <unk> act was a fluke
they wanted reform and they got a revolution says overhaul advocate <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
so is the tax code now open game again
<unk> <unk> thinks so
one recent <unk> morning he stayed inside the <unk> monitoring tax - and-budget talks instead of flying to <unk> <unk> for a fund - raiser and then to his hometown of <unk> for the <unk> reunion of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
i too old <unk> to waste a weekend but that what i did the <unk> <unk> <unk> moans
these days anything can happen
<unk> <unk> said <unk> passenger volume climbed n for the first nine months of <unk> to n million passengers from n million passengers in the year - earlier period
the west german national air carrier said <unk> cargo volume jumped <unk> to <unk> metric tons from <unk> tons a year ago
load factor or percentage of seats filled climbed to <unk> from <unk> even though the number of flights rose <unk> to <unk> in the first - three quarters
from <unk> through <unk> the distance flown by <unk> airplanes rose <unk> to n million kilometers from a year earlier the company added n
<unk> <unk> in a <unk> letter defending a weak <unk> book likened a champion writer to a baseball pitcher
when the champ has lost his stuff the great mystery novelist wrote <unk> when he can no longer throw the high hard one he throws his heart instead
he throws something
he does n't just walk off the mound and weep
<unk> might have been predicting the course of his own career
his last published novel featuring private detective <unk> <unk> the inferior <unk> <unk> at times read almost like a parody of his previous work
when he died in <unk> <unk> left behind four chapters of yet another <unk> book the <unk> <unk> <unk> which seemed to go beyond parody into something like burlesque
<unk> <unk> last pitch apparently was a screwball
now <unk> <unk> author of several best sellers featuring <unk> a contemporary private eye in the <unk> mold has with the blessings of the <unk> estate been hired to complete the <unk> <unk> <unk>
the result <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> pages <unk> is an entertaining easy n to read and fairly graceful extension of the <unk> chronicle full of hard - boiled wisecracks and <unk> color
if it does not quite have <unk> special magic well at the end neither did <unk>
as the book begins a newly wed <unk> roars into the desert resort of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> at the wheel of a <unk> <unk>
his bride is the rich and beautiful <unk> <unk> a character who also appeared in <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk>
<unk> and <unk> move into her mansion and ca n't keep their hands off each other even in front of the hawaiian\/japanese houseman
but the lovebirds have a conflict
he wants to continue being a low - paid private eye and she wants him to live off the million dollars <unk> she settled on him
that <unk> setup
<unk> <unk> spins it into a pretty satisfying tale involving <unk> <unk> high life <unk> low life and various folk who hang their hats in both worlds
the supporting lineup is solid the patter is amusing and there even a cameo by <unk> <unk> the good cop of previous <unk> books who still does n't hesitate to have <unk> jailed when it suits his purposes
the style throughout bears a strong resemblance to <unk> prose at its most pared down
all told <unk> <unk> does a better job of making a novel out of this abandoned fragment than anyone might have had a right to expect
but there are grounds for complaint
at one point the reader is two steps ahead of <unk> in catching on to a double identity scam and <unk> is supposed to be the pro
more bothersome there are several apparent anachronisms
contact lenses tank tops prostitutes openly working the streets of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> cocktail all seem out of place in the n
a little more care in <unk> - creating <unk> universe would have made the book that much more enjoyable
<unk> <unk> is a contributing editor at <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> spent eight years as the editor in chief of the japanese edition of <unk> <unk>
<unk> has been a major importer of foreign information and news says <unk> <unk>
but one gets fed up with importing information and news
<unk> <unk> has turned the tables
today he is publisher of <unk> <unk> magazine the first <unk> - language business magazine devoted to coverage of japanese business
after a slick redesign the two - year-old magazine has been relaunched this month by its parent company <unk> <unk> the <unk> - based company with interests that include financial services book publishing and a tourist agency
printed in the <unk> and carrying the line the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> cover story was the <unk> no . n <unk> japanese women
<unk> is one of a small but growing band of japanese companies taking their first steps into american publishing after making major investments in entertainment real estate and banking companies here
japanese concerns have retained a number of publishing consultants and media brokers <unk> to study the <unk> market including the <unk> <unk> - based investment banker <unk> <unk> associates
and they are quietly linking up with <unk> publishing trade groups
japanese publishers want to be introduced to the publishing and information industries said <unk> <unk> chairman of <unk> <unk>
while there are n't any major deals in the works currently on the scale of <unk> <unk> recent <unk> billion agreement to buy <unk> pictures <unk> <unk> observers do n't rule out a transaction of that size
the japanese take the long view said <unk> <unk>
it may not be weeks or months but they are also opportunistic and if they feel comfortable they will move on a deal he said
in recent months three big <unk> - based publishing concerns including <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> no relation and <unk> <unk> applied for membership in <unk> publishers of <unk> which represents almost all <unk> consumer magazines
japanese involvement in american publishing has been so small to date that magazines such as <unk> <unk> are considered groundbreakers
when <unk> launched <unk> <unk> in <unk> it appealed to a more multinational audience
the magazine was overhauled with the aid of american magazine design gurus <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and targets top - level <unk> executives with japanese and american advertisers
american publishers appear more than ready to do some selling
<unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> publisher of the <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> he receives telephone calls weekly from media bankers on whether his parent company is interested in buying a <unk> consumer or business magazine

profits at <unk> could be under attack for every retailer asserts <unk> <unk> president and chief operating officer of <unk> <unk> an off - price chain
even if there is n't any widespread discounting the outlook for industry profits is n't good
<unk> <unk> forecasts a <unk> profit decline for non - auto retailers this year after annual drops that averaged n in <unk> and <unk>

the week ending the <unk> is going to save the entire month for everyone
the spanish author <unk> <unk> <unk> won the <unk> <unk> for literature yesterday a surprising choice but given the <unk> <unk> past perversities hardly the most undeserved and ridiculous accolade handed out by the awarding committee
in <unk> anyway the <unk> <unk> <unk> enjoys some renown for the novels and travel books n he wrote during the parched <unk> years the everyday poverty and stagnant atmosphere of which he described in brutally direct vivid prose beginning with the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>
unlike other writers who either battled the fascists during the <unk> <unk> or left <unk> when <unk> triumphed <unk> <unk> fought briefly on the general side no doubt earning with his war wound some forbearance when he went on to depict a country with a high population of vagabonds murderers and rural idiots trudging aimlessly through a dried - out land
still it was in argentine editions that his countrymen first read his story of <unk> <unk> a field worker who stabbed his mother to death and has no regrets as he awaits his end in a prison cell <unk> directs some men down the flower - bordered path and others down the road bordered with thistles and prickly pears
the lucky ones gaze out at life with serene eyes and smile with a face of innocence at their perfumed happiness
the others endure the hot sun of the plains and scowl like cornered wild beasts
<unk> <unk> himself was one of the lucky ones his fortunes steadily increasing over the decades n he spent putting out some <unk> travelogues novels short story collections and poetry
these days he is as known for his flamboyant tastes and the youthful muse who shares his life as he is for his books
the man who wore out his shoes wandering around <unk> in <unk> describing in his travel book <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> how he scrounged for food and stayed in squalid inns now tours <unk> in a <unk> - <unk>
of his n novels the <unk> n full of sharp vignettes of <unk> life and centered on a cafe run by <unk> <unk> a foul - mouthed broad - based woman with blackened little teeth encrusted in filth used to be available in <unk> translated by <unk> <unk> and published by <unk> <unk> which now no doubt regrets relinquishing its copyright
here is an excerpt
the lonely woman walks on in the direction of the <unk> de <unk> <unk>
two men have a conversation behind one of the windows of the cafe on the corner of the boulevard
both are young one twenty odd the other thirty odd
the older one looks like a member of the jury for a literary award the younger one looks like a novelist
it is evident that their conversation runs more or less on the following lines i submitted the manuscript of my novel under the title <unk> <unk> <unk> and in it i treated a few neglected aspects of that eternal problem which
oh yes
will you pour me a drop of water if you do n't mind
with pleasure
i revised it several times and i think n i may say with pride that there is not a single discordant word in the whole text
how interesting
i think so
i do n't know the quality of the works n my colleagues have sent in but in any case i feel confident that good sense and honest judgment
rest assured we proceed with exemplary fairness
i do n't doubt it for a moment
it does not matter if one is defeated provided n the work that gets the award has unmistakable qualities
what so discouraging is
in passing the window <unk> <unk> gives them a smile simply out of habit
<unk> <unk> <unk> said n it will take after - tax charges of n million or <unk> a share in its fiscal fourth quarter ended <unk> n
because of the charge <unk> expects to report a loss for the fourth quarter and significantly lower results for fiscal <unk>
the oil refiner said n it will report fiscal fourth quarter and <unk> results next week
the company earned n million or <unk> a share on revenue of <unk> billion in the year - ago fourth quarter
for fiscal <unk> <unk> had net of n million or <unk> a share on revenue of <unk> billion
both revenue figures exclude excise taxes
the charges consist of a n million after - tax charge <unk> to cover cost overruns in <unk> <unk> <unk> subsidiary a previously announced n million after - tax charge resulting from a n million settlement with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and a n million after - tax charge from the previously announced sale of its <unk> <unk> <unk> subsidiary
<unk> expects that sale to be complete next year
the charge for the <unk> subsidiary is for expected costs <unk> to correct problems with certain bed boilers built for utilities
the charge will be added to n million in reserves established a year ago to cover the cost overruns
when <unk> <unk> arrives here next week for a hemispheric summit organized to commemorate a century of costa rican democracy will he be able to deliver a credible message in the wake of the panamanian fiasco
undoubtedly <unk> <unk> will be praised by some latin leaders prone to pay lip service to nonintervention while they privately encourage more assertive <unk> action n to remove <unk> <unk> <unk> and safeguard their countries from a <unk> onslaught
the panamanian affair is only the tip of a more alarming iceberg
it originates in a <unk> administration decision not to antagonize the <unk> <unk> and avoid at all costs being accused of meddling in the region
the result has been a dangerous vacuum of <unk> leadership which leaves <unk> <unk> open to soviet adventurism
the influence of the <unk> is not being felt in <unk> <unk> <unk> decisions do not respond to a policy and are divorced from reality says <unk> <unk> a costa rican congressman and former foreign minister
the disarray of the <unk> administration <unk> diplomacy was evident in the failure of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> to condemn categorically <unk> <unk>
faced with this embarrassment <unk> diplomats expressed confidence that the influential <unk> <unk> of south american nations which gathered last week in <unk> would take a stronger posture toward the panamanian dictator
but other than a few slaps on the wrist <unk> <unk> went unpunished by that body too he was not even singled out in the closing statement
now <unk> <unk> will come to <unk> <unk> and encounter nicaraguan strongman <unk> <unk> eager for photo opportunities with the <unk> president
the host costa rican <unk> <unk> <unk> did not invite <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> to the summit which was to be restricted to democracies
however <unk> <unk> was included
formally upgrading the sandinistas to a democratic status was an initiative harshly criticized in the costa rican press
even <unk> <unk> <unk> the presidential candidate for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> made public his opposition to the presence of <unk> in a democratic festivity
nevertheless the <unk> administration agreed to the dubious arrangement in <unk> a few weeks before the central american presidents met in <unk> <unk> to discuss a timetable for disbanding the anti - sandinista rebels
according to officials in <unk> the <unk> <unk> hoped that by pleasing <unk> <unk> it would gain his support n to postpone any decision on the <unk> until after <unk> <unk> promises of democratic elections were tested next <unk>
however relying on an ardent critic of the <unk> administration and the <unk> movement for help in delaying the disarming of the contras was risky business
and even some last - minute phone calls that <unk> <unk> made at the behest of some conservative <unk> senators n to enlist backing for the <unk> position failed to stop the march of <unk> <unk> agenda
prior to this episode <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> sensing an open field undertook a personal diplomatic mission through <unk> <unk> <unk> to promote an early disbanding of the rebels
visiting <unk> he praised the sandinistas for their electoral system and chided the <unk> administration for not rewarding the sandinistas
in <unk> where the contras are a hot political issue he promised to help unblock some n million in assistance withheld due to the failure of local agencies to comply with conditions agreed upon with <unk>
aid was also the gist of the talks <unk> <unk> <unk> had with salvadoran <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> government is very much at the mercy of <unk> largess and is forced to listen very carefully to <unk> <unk> likes and dislikes
it was therefore not surprising that close allies of the <unk> virtually neglected by the <unk> administration ordered the nicaraguan insurgents dismantled by <unk> long before the elections
fittingly the <unk> <unk> were nicknamed by hondurans the <unk> plan
the individual foreign policy carried out by <unk> legislators adds to a confusing <unk> performance that has emboldened soviet initiatives in <unk> <unk>
on <unk> n following conversations with <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> arrived in <unk> to acclaim <unk> great peace efforts
there <unk> <unk> felt legitimized to unveil his own peace plan the <unk> would prolong a suspension of arms shipments to <unk> after the <unk> election if the <unk> did likewise with its allies in <unk> <unk>
he also called on <unk> neighbors to accept a military equilibrium guaranteed by both superpowers
the <unk> claims that in spite of <unk> words <unk> <unk> weapons continue to flow into <unk> through <unk> at near - record levels
since <unk> <unk> proposals followed discussions with <unk> <unk> speculations arose that the <unk> administration was seeking an accommodation with the soviets in <unk> <unk>
this scheme would fit the <unk> <unk> which declared a false symmetry between soviet military aid to the <unk> dictatorship and that provided by <unk> to freely elected governments
furthermore it is also likely to encourage those on <unk> <unk> asking for cuts in the assistance to <unk> <unk> if <unk> <unk> does not bend to demands of the marxist guerrillas
the sad condition of <unk> policy in <unk> <unk> is best depicted by the recent end to <unk> sponsorship of <unk> <unk> <unk>
in <unk> the costa rican government requested help to establish a radio station in the northern part of the country flooded by airwaves of sandinista propaganda
recovering radiophonic sovereignty was the purpose of <unk> <unk> <unk> funded by the <unk> and affiliated with the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
a few months ago the <unk> administration decided to stop this cooperation leaving <unk> <unk> <unk> operating on a shoestring
according to news reports the abrupt termination was due to fears that <unk> transmissions could interfere with the peace process
in the meantime <unk> gave <unk> another powerful radio transmitter which has been installed in the city of <unk>
it is capable of reaching the entire caribbean area and deep into <unk> <unk>
perhaps its loud signal may generate some awareness of the soviet condominium being created in the isthmus thanks to <unk> default
the soviet entrenchment in <unk> is alarming for <unk> <unk> a peaceful democracy without an army
questioned in <unk> about what would happen if his much - heralded peace plan would fail <unk> <unk> voiced expectations of direct <unk> action
a poll conducted in <unk> by a gallup affiliate showed that <unk> of <unk> ricans believe that if their country is militarily attacked by either <unk> or <unk> the <unk> will come to its defense
but in the light of events in <unk> where the <unk> has such clear strategic interests waiting for the <unk> <unk> may prove to be a dangerous gambit
<unk> <unk> is a lawyer and a columnist for <unk> <unk> newspaper
<unk> <unk> said <unk> net income jumped n partly on the strength of record operating income in its gaming division
separately the hotel and gambling giant said <unk> it was proceeding with plans to make a tender offer and solicit consents with respect to approximately n billion of its publicly traded debt
that debt is part of the <unk> billion of <unk> debt that <unk> <unk> of <unk> said n it would retire or assume when it agreed to buy the <unk> <unk> business in <unk>
<unk> said <unk> third - quarter earnings rose to n million or <unk> a share from n million or n cents a share a year earlier
results for the quarter included n million in pretax gains from property transactions including the sale of one <unk> suites hotel and n million of nonrecurring costs associated with the acquisition of the <unk> <unk> business by <unk>
<unk> said <unk> operating income related to gaming increased <unk> to a record n million from n million a year earlier
the jump reflected record results in <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> as well as a full quarter results from <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
third - quarter revenue rose <unk> to n million from n million
for the nine months earnings fell <unk> to n million or <unk> a share from n million or <unk> a share a year earlier
revenue dropped <unk> to n billion from n billion
the tender offer and consent solicitation will be made to debtholders in <unk>
in effect <unk> is asking holders for permission for <unk> to buy their debt
<unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has been retained to act as the dealer - manager and financial adviser in connection with the offer and solicitation
the debt issues involved and the proposed consent fees and cash tender offer prices expressed per n of principal amount are as follows <unk> <unk> senior notes due n at <unk> <unk> subordinated debt due n at <unk> <unk> <unk> notes due n at <unk> and <unk> <unk> notes due n at n
<unk> said <unk> its n notes due n also will be included in the tender offer and consent solicitation at a price n to be determined by <unk> prior to the commencement of the offer
the television units of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> are exploring the possibility of offering prime - time programming to independent stations two nights a week industry executives say n
although such a venture would n't match the fourth network created by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> may have similar ambitions
<unk> which also owns six tv stations provides programs three nights a week to those and other affiliates
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> formed a joint venture last month named <unk> <unk> <unk> n to sell advertising in programs syndicated by both companies such as <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
a spokeswoman for <unk> said <unk> the company does n't comment on speculation
calls to <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> were n't returned
the two companies like <unk> already have their own tv stations
<unk> owns <unk> in <unk> <unk> and <unk> last month agreed to purchase a <unk> stake in the <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> in a deal valued at n million
<unk> owns five stations including <unk> a <unk> affiliate in <unk>
one broadcasting executive familiar with the project said n the co - venture would target stations affiliated with <unk> because <unk> has the desirable independent stations in most of the key cities
currently <unk> supplies programs on <unk> <unk> and mondays although the company plans to expand to other weeknights
<unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> said we believe n the partnership of <unk> its affiliates and advertisers is succeeding and will continue to grow
another <unk> official who declined to be identified said <unk> <unk> was n't pleased by the possible <unk> - <unk> venture into prime - time programming
to make the venture work they would need <unk> affiliates he said
we spent a lot of time and money in building our group of stations he said adding that <unk> does n't appreciate another company attempting to usurp its station lineup
<unk> said n it plans to offer its stations movies theatrical and made - for-tv ventures probably on wednesdays sometime next year
it is also planning another night of original series
<unk> and <unk> according to the broadcasting executive plan to offer theatrical movies produced separately by <unk> and <unk> for wednesdays and perhaps a block of original shows fridays
the executive said <unk> <unk> and <unk> have also held discussions with <unk> - <unk> industries broadcasting unit which owns five independent stations in cities such as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
a <unk> - <unk> station manager said n there have been no formal talks
i think n it to <unk> advantage to be associated with the <unk> - <unk> venture said <unk> <unk> station manager of <unk> the <unk> station that is a <unk> affiliate
<unk> <unk> said <unk> the <unk> shows appearing on nights when <unk> - <unk> shows would n't be offered could be promoted on the programs produced by <unk> - <unk>
<unk> <unk> general manager of <unk> a <unk> affiliate in <unk> <unk> said the real question is whether the <unk> - <unk> offering is practical
it is n't
why would i consider giving up <unk> a proven commodity for an unknown venture
<unk> attracts a young audience with shows such as <unk> with <unk> its most successful series
<unk> <unk> de <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> agreed to merge in a transaction valued at n million
under the agreement <unk> stockholders will be able to exchange each of their shares for either shares in the new entity or cash

<unk> <unk> originally proposed the merger in <unk> in a cash and stock transaction valued at <unk> a share or about n million
banponce reacted cooly at first but appeared to be won over analysts said <unk> by <unk> <unk> assurances that it wanted only a friendly transaction
<unk> <unk> just kept waiting said <unk> <unk> a vice president and analyst at <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
they got a transaction that good for both companies
the two banks appear to be a good fit
banponce caters to a more affluent customer while <unk> <unk> has always had a large presence among middle - income and lower - income markets
the merger should also allow the companies to reduce costs by combining operations in many locations in <unk> <unk>
they often right across the street from one another <unk> <unk> said
<unk> <unk> who is currently president and chief executive officer of <unk> <unk> said <unk> the merger will result in a larger and stronger locally based bank
<unk> <unk> who will now serve as president and chief executive officer of the subsidiary bank added we be able to better compete with large foreign banks
it makes sense from a strategic standpoint

the banks said n they do n't expect the merger to face any regulatory hurdles

we are not in any hurry to sell <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> other <unk> retail properties said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>

steel jackets of a type that may have prevented collapse of the columns of a <unk> stretch of the <unk> <unk> had been installed on at least a small test section of the double - decker highway last year by <unk> <unk> of <unk> employees familiar with the project say n
the test project which reportedly survived <unk> earthquake was a prelude to a state plan to retrofit that critical section of the freeway with the steel casings
state engineers have made a preliminary finding that it was failure of the concrete columns wrenched and separated from the double - decker roadbed that was responsible for the collapse
the failure in <unk> of the freeway segment known as the <unk> structure was the deadliest aspect of the quake although officials were hopeful yesterday that the death toll there might be significantly lower than the <unk> initially feared
sorting out the wreckage is expected to take several days
red tractors gingerly picked at the rubble while jackhammers tried to break up some of the massive slabs of concrete
giant yellow cranes were wheeled up alongside the collapsed segment preparing to lift off chunks of the debris
in <unk> a transportation department spokesman said n he could n't immediately confirm or deny existence of the test work
however he asserted that the department had n't mastered the technology needed to retrofit the entire <unk> structure
moreover other officials noted snafus in transportation funding that the state has experienced over the years may have restricted the availability of funds for such a retrofitting even if it were technologically feasible
knowledgeable employees said <unk> the retrofitting which had n't yet been budgeted was part of a planned three - stage reinforcement of the <unk> structure begun by the <unk> transportation department several years ago
the <unk> reinforcement project itself was part of an annual effort to shore up structures believed vulnerable to earthquakes
the state began such work after a n tremblor in <unk> <unk> when numerous bridges collapsed
we had just finished phase two of the <unk> project that involved installing a series of retaining cables designed n to prevent sections of the roadway from separating as a result of seismic shock a state <unk> engineer said n
after completing installation of the jackets on one frame of the freeway last year the state <unk> had sent the project over to its <unk> engineers <unk> to draw up a final design
knowledgeable employees said <unk> the project had been stymied somewhat by the difficulty of designing the jackets
the procedure involves encasing the concrete columns with steel then connecting them more securely to the double - decker roadbed
the employees also said <unk> the project may have been snagged by budgetary concerns
one preliminary estimate put the retrofitting cost at as much as n million
the collapse of the span has provoked surprise and anger among state officials
<unk> <unk> <unk> who said n he had been assured by state transportation officials that the structure could withstand an even larger quake called for an immediate investigation
i want to know who made the decision that it was safe for n people to use every day said <unk> <unk> a state legislator who is chairman of the <unk> <unk> transportation committee
he said n he would convene hearings within two weeks
the <unk> structure opened in <unk> <unk> and as such like many buildings in the <unk> <unk> <unk> area does not meet current building codes requiring considerably more steel support
the northern piers of the span lie in estuarian deposits that were of a type n to have liquefied easily during the <unk> quake
transportation department officials however said n they were as surprised as anyone by the <unk> destruction
they said <unk> previous earthquakes suggested that multiple - column viaducts would stand up well although they were working on ways n to bolster them
unfortunately there is only one laboratory for developing techniques n to withstand earthquakes and that is an earthquake said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> district director for the transportation department
he said we know of no technology that exists anywhere in the world that would allow us to reinforce the columns
<unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> said <unk> it rescheduled to <unk> n a special shareholder meeting n to vote on a n million stock - for-debt exchange
the meeting had been scheduled for <unk> n but the company delayed the meeting to allow time n for the securities and <unk> <unk> to review the proposal
as part of a restructuring announced earlier this year the company proposed in <unk> to exchange <unk> newly issued common shares for each <unk> face value of debt
however that figure could be revised <unk> <unk> said <unk>
currently the company has about six million common shares outstanding
if all the debt was converted about n million new shares would be issued
in composite trading <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> closed at <unk> unchanged
the debt consists of n million of <unk> <unk> subordinated notes due n and n million of <unk> convertible subordinated debentures due n
<unk> <unk> also is proposing to exchange each of its n outstanding shares of cumulative convertible preferred series <unk> stock for two shares of common
after years of quarreling over <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> appear to have shifted onto a united course in <unk> <unk>
<unk> and <unk> have taken a leading role in aid for the reformist countries pledging billions of dollars in fresh credit and forgiving old debt while urging other industrial nations to follow suit
both hope to encourage pressure for change in <unk> <unk> countries still ruled by stalinist holdouts by arranging liberal financial aid and trade benefits for <unk> <unk> and to a lesser extent the <unk> <unk>
west german officials also have the special goal of holding out hope for <unk> <unk> fledgling reform movement
the change taking place in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> has aroused new hope in both german states that reforms will be undertaken in <unk> <unk> and that relations between the two german states too will get better said <unk> <unk> <unk> - <unk> <unk>
addressing a conference of the <unk> <unk> - based <unk> for <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> yesterday <unk> <unk> said history will judge us by whether we have taken the opportunities that emerge from these reforms
the ultimate aim of western support for <unk> bloc reforms he said <unk> is to create an equitable and stable peaceful order in <unk> from the <unk> to the urals
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in separate speeches at the conference appealed for more western contributions to economic reforms and business development in <unk> and <unk>
<unk> and <unk> are leading supporters of <unk> request for a n billion stand - by credit from the <unk> <unk> <unk>
we want the bold programs of market development and political freedom in <unk> and in <unk> to succeed
we are prepared to support those changes said <unk> <unk>
<unk> curbs on the exports of sensitive technology to <unk> bloc countries will remain in place however
meanwhile the <unk> <unk> of <unk> yesterday approved an n million aid package for <unk> and <unk> that more than doubles the amount n <unk> <unk> had requested
the package was brought to the <unk> just n days after it was introduced indicating <unk> eagerness to reward <unk> and <unk> for their moves toward democracy and freemarket economic reforms
the legislation approved n and sent to the <unk> establishes two enterprise funds n to be governed by independent nonprofit boards which will make loans and investments in new business ventures in <unk> and <unk>
the polish fund would be seeded with n million the hungarian fund with n million
in addition a group of <unk> industrialized countries including the <unk> and <unk> and coordinated by the <unk> <unk> <unk> has promised <unk> and <unk> trade advice and a line of credit equivalent to n billion through the <unk> <unk> <unk> while the <unk> plans n million in direct aid
when <unk> <unk> <unk> travels to <unk> <unk> n he is expected to take with him a promise of three billion west german marks n billion in new credit guarantees for industrial projects
last week <unk> agreed to reschedule n billion marks in polish debt that came due last year
in addition a one billion mark credit dating from <unk> is to be written off
<unk> plan to switch to a free - market economy by <unk> is hampered by a foreign debt load of n billion
<unk> <unk> also has increased its credit guarantees to <unk> by n million marks to n billion marks as the emerging democratic state rushes through its own economic reforms including a broad privatization of state - owned industry and tax incentives for industrial investment
an additional n million marks in credit - backing was promised by the west german state governments of <unk> and <unk> - <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> which last year arranged a three billion mark credit for the <unk> <unk> is now moving to become the first west german bank <unk> to set up independent business offices in <unk> and <unk> as they shift to free - market economies
a maxim of <unk> banking holds that wherever <unk> <unk> goes other west german banks follow
indeed at least four other west german banks are believed to be making inquiries
<unk> <unk> said <unk> third - quarter net income rose <unk> to n million or n cents a share from n million or n cents a share a year ago
revenue rose <unk> to n million from n million a year earlier
<unk> world - wide volume has grown <unk> in a climate of relatively flat industry sales said <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman
he said <unk> the toy company prospects for a strong fourth quarter are also good
<unk> attributed the jump in quarter net to strong world - wide sales of its <unk> doll <unk> <unk> cars <unk> toys and other well - known toy lines
the company also cited retail trade and consumer demand for new products introduced this year such as <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
for the nine months <unk> net more than doubled to n million or <unk> a share from n million or n cents a share a year ago
revenue rose <unk> to n million from n million
<unk> said <unk> the company sale of rights to land and buildings at its <unk> <unk> headquarters resulted in a n million charge to third - quarter operating profit
the charge did n't affect net for the quarter as it was offset by tax benefits
<unk> has purchased a new headquarters building in <unk> <unk> <unk> which it will occupy by the end of next year
democracy can be cruel to politicians sometimes it forces them to make choices
now that the <unk> <unk> opened the door on the subject of abortion politicians are squinting under the glare of democratic choice
their discomfort is a healthy sign for the rest of us
republicans are squinting most painfully at least at first which is only fair because they been shielded the most
so long as abortion was a question for litigation not legislation republicans could find political security in absolutism
they could attract one - issue voters by adopting the right - to-life movement strongest position even as pro - choice republicans knew <unk> this mattered little on an issue monopolized by the court
now it matters
much of <unk> thought <unk> it detected <unk> <unk> in a characteristic waffle on abortion the past week
only a month ago he warned <unk> not to pass legislation to pay for abortions in cases of rape or incest
last <unk> after <unk> passed it anyway he hinted n he was looking for compromise
was the man who once was pro - choice but later pro - life converting again
in fact <unk> <unk> dance was more wiggle than waffle
pro - life advocates say n the <unk> <unk> never wavered over the veto
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a pro - life leader in the <unk> suggested a compromise that would have adapted restrictive language from rape and incest exceptions in the states
the <unk> <unk> never eager for a fight was happy to try which is why <unk> <unk> said <unk> he was looking for flexibility last week
when democrats refused to budge pro - life republicans met at the <unk> <unk> with <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> and <unk> <unk> quickly signaled a veto
amid charges of timidity on <unk> and elsewhere the president was n't about to offend his most energetic constituency
the <unk> doubters were in <unk>
in last week <unk> vote <unk> republicans defected
after the vote <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> rounded up nearly as many signatures on a letter to <unk> <unk> urging him not to veto
even such a pro - life stalwart as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> had counseled some kind of compromise
the <unk> passed the same bill yesterday with a veto - proof majority of <unk>
the manuevering illustrates an emerging republican donnybrook pacified since the early n
at the <unk> <unk> convention abortion was barely discussed at all though delegates were evenly divided on the question of an anti - abortion constitutional amendment
<unk> <unk> made a passionate statement to the platform committee but she was talking to herself
now many republicans are listening
they frightened by what they see in <unk> <unk> and especially <unk> where pro - life <unk> candidates for governor are being pummeled on abortion
<unk> <unk> a republican consultant says <unk> the two <unk> candidates could have avoided trouble if they had framed the issue first
in <unk> <unk> <unk> and his running mate <unk> <unk> are both on the defensive for opposing abortions even in cases of rape or incest
but <unk> <unk> adds the net loser in the next few years is the right - to-life side
<unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> says <unk> exit polls from the <unk> election had single - issue pro - life voters giving <unk> <unk> about five more percentage points of support than pro - choice voters gave <unk> <unk>
but the <unk> <unk> opening of debate may have changed even that
<unk> pollster <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> says n polls this summer showed that the single - issue voters had about evened out
polls are no substitute for principle but they do for some politicians
the republican danger is <unk> that abortion could become for them what it long been for democrats a divisive litmus test
it already that in the <unk> administration at least for any job in which abortion is even remotely an issue
<unk> official <unk> <unk> lost a chance for a senior job in the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> services after right - to-life activists opposed him
<unk> <unk> a conservative former congressman was barred from a <unk> services post after he gave wrong answers on abortion
even the president doctor <unk> <unk> has said on the record that he love to be surgeon general but could n't pass the pro - life test
in the case of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the litmus test could yet damage issues important to other parts of the republican coalition
after <unk> <unk> waffled on abortion last year the <unk> <unk> appeased right - to-lifers by surrounding him with pro - life deputies
their views on health care and welfare did n't much matter though <unk> spends billions a year on both
it makes only a handful of abortion - related decisions
though democrats can gloat at all this for now they may want to contain their glee
on abortion their own day will come
eventually even republicans will find a way n to frame the issue in ways that expose pro - choice absolutism
does the candidate favor parental consent for teen - age abortions
the pro - choice lobby does n't
what about banning abortions in the second and third trimesters
the lobby says no again
democracy is forcing the abortion debate toward healthy compromise toward the unpolarizing middle
<unk> v. <unk> pre - empted political debate so the extremes blossomed
now the ambivalent middle a moral majority of sorts is reasserting itself
within a few years the outcome in most states is likely to be that abortion will be more restricted but not completely banned
this is where the voters are which is where politicians usually end up

<unk> <unk> editor of <unk> a <unk> <unk> industry newsletter says i seen a lot of people fooling around on the fringes of filtering information

moreover <unk> <unk> computers can weigh the value of an article based on how closely the story matches the subscriber interest area
it compares the position of key words in the story words in the headline or first paragraph get a higher value

<unk> farmer <unk> <unk> writing in the fall issue of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> about the proposed location of a hazardous - waste incinerator in his county
of course i rather have a computer software firm in my backyard than a hazardous waste incinerator
but i also rather live next door to an incinerator than to some of the hog farms n i seen and smelt in these parts
an incinerator is also probably better than having nobody next door on our farm there are four unoccupied houses
on my four - mile drive to farm headquarters each morning i drive by another four empty houses
a community of abandoned farmsteads failing businesses and crumbling roads and bridges is hardly a desirable one
the loss of n jobs by a depressed county in rural <unk> is hardly of national importance except for this if the most environmentally safe way of dealing with a national problem can not be built in <unk> <unk> what hope have we for dealing with the wastes n our economy produces
after all farmers here work with hazardous chemicals every day many of them the same chemicals that would have been destroyed in the incinerator
we know n they are dangerous but if handled with care their benefits far outweigh any risk to the environment
just because <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> did nothing when its valuable n mural was thrown in the trash does n't mean <unk> the city no longer owns the work of art a federal judge ruled n

the <unk> mural painted by <unk> <unk> in <unk> was commissioned by the federal <unk> <unk> <unk>
after the discarded mural was found outside the school by a concerned <unk> graduate it eventually was turned over to <unk> <unk> a professional art restorer
throughout the <unk> <unk> school and city officials made no effort to locate the mural
apparently the officials did n't even know <unk> the mural was missing until n when a researcher found that the painting was in <unk> <unk> studio and questioned school officials about it
in <unk> <unk> officials thanked <unk> <unk> for taking care of the mural and demanded n he return it as soon as possible
<unk> <unk> however sued <unk> claiming that the city had abandoned the artwork and that it had waited too long to reclaim it
but <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of federal court in <unk> ruled that the city could n't be faulted for waiting too long because it did n't realize until <unk> that its ownership of the painting was in dispute
the judge also ruled that the painting was n't abandoned because officials did n't intend for it to be thrown away and were unaware that the workmen had discarded it

the prices of corn futures contracts jumped amid rumors that the <unk> <unk> is keeping up its dizzying <unk> buying binge of <unk> corn
those rumors were confirmed after the end of trading yesterday when the <unk> <unk> <unk> announced that the soviets had bought n million metric tons of <unk> corn bringing their <unk> corn purchases confirmed so far this month to about five million metric tons
in trading at the <unk> <unk> of <unk> the corn contract for <unk> delivery jumped n cents a bushel to settle at <unk> a bushel
the soviet purchases are close to exceeding what some analysts had expected the <unk> <unk> to buy this fall the season in which it usually buys much of the corn n it imports from the <unk>
that pace is causing some analysts to speculate that the <unk> <unk> might soon purchase as much as another two million metric tons
one sign that more soviet purchases are possible is that <unk> grain companies yesterday bought an unusually large amount of corn futures contracts
that sometimes signals that they are laying plans to export corn
by some estimates several grain companies combined bought contracts for the possession of roughly one million metric tons of corn
by buying futures contracts these companies attempt to protect themselves from swings in the price of the corn that they are obligated to deliver
rumors of soviet interest also pushed up the prices of soybean futures contracts
among other things the <unk> <unk> is widely thought to be mulling whether to subsidize the sale of soybean oil to the <unk> <unk>
on top of all this corn and soybean prices rose on reports that the <unk> harvest was disrupted by a freakishly early snow storm that dumped several inches in parts of <unk> and <unk>
the harvest delays however are expected to be temporary
balmy temperatures are forecast for next week said <unk> <unk> <unk> an analyst at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
many farmers used the jump in prices to sell their recently harvested crop to grain elevator companies
the heavy selling by farmers helped to damp the price rally
wheat futures prices rose slightly
in other commodity markets yesterday
precious metals
futures prices declined
a number of developments were negatively interpreted by traders
<unk> delivery gold fell n an ounce to <unk>
<unk> silver eased n cents an ounce to <unk>
<unk> platinum was down n an ounce at <unk>
one price - depressing development was the lower - than-expected increase of only n in the consumer price index for <unk> an analyst said <unk>
he noted that the core inflation rate which excludes food and energy was also low at <unk>
other news that weighed on the market initial unemployment claims rose by n last week <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> will reduce its managerial staff by <unk> through attrition the oil market turned weaker there was n't any investor demand for bullion and the dollar strengthened during the day putting pressure on gold
also the analyst said n economic circumstances are such that both <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> the principal gold and platinum producers are being forced to continue selling the metals
both are in great need of foreign exchange and <unk> <unk> is also under pressure to meet foreign loan commitments he said n
putting it all together we have a negative scenario that does n't look like it will improve overnight he said
copper
futures prices recovered in quiet trading
the <unk> contract rose n cents a pound to n
that contract fell a total of n cents during the first three days of this week mostly in reaction to last <unk> stock market plunge which prompted concern that it might signal a similar sharp slowing of the <unk> economy and thus reduced demand for copper a leading industrial metal
in recent days however there has been increased purchasing of copper in <unk> an analyst said <unk>
some of this buying was by <unk> which has had its supplies sharply reduced by long production stoppages at the <unk> mine in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> mine in <unk> <unk> and the <unk> mine in <unk> which are major shippers to <unk>
the increasing likelihood that <unk> and <unk> <unk> will soon return to production may have cut some of that purchasing but even if any of these mines begin operating soon their output wo n't be significant until at least the end of the year analysts note <unk>
so one analyst said even though the long - term production problems may be easing there will still be a significant need for copper over the next three months when inventories will remain relatively low
<unk>
crude oil prices ended mixed
<unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> delivery fell n cents a barrel to n
but so - called outer month contracts finished higher
for instance <unk> contracts for <unk> rose n cents to <unk>
most energy futures opened lower following <unk> market downturn
but a flurry of late trading yesterday beefed up prices
heating oil and gasoline futures ended higher as well
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> law offices may have been the epicenter of legal activity after <unk> earthquake
in the first <unk> minutes after his office telephone service was restored yesterday morning n potential clients had called seeking the services of the self - proclaimed <unk> of <unk>
<unk> <unk> like many other personal - injury lawyers suspects that the earthquake which measured n on the <unk> scale will generate enough lawsuits n to keep this city personal - injury and construction lawyers busy for quite some time
suits are likely to be filed against engineering firms contractors and developers as well as against local - government agencies
but lawyers looking to cash in on the quake may have a tough time once their cases reach a judge
experts on <unk> tort law say <unk> protections afforded government agencies in such cases are pretty ironclad
even claims against individuals and companies face significant roadblocks
the major legal barrier is the principle that no one can be held liable for an act of <unk>
for now says <unk> <unk> <unk> president - elect of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the last thing n we really need to worry about is whether anybody is going to get sued or whether they have liability or not
we still have people wandering around in a daze in <unk> <unk> worrying about whether it going to rain tonight
but that wo n't stop plaintiffs lawyers from seeking a little room for maneuvering
in <unk> <unk> they argue <unk> an earthquake was a near certainty
therefore engineering firms construction contractors and developers can be sued for not keeping structures up to standard and government agencies can be held accountable for failing to properly protect citizens from such a foreseeable disaster if negligence can be proven
my prediction is n there will be mass litigation over errors and omissions in engineering and contracting says <unk> <unk> a well - known <unk> plaintiffs lawyer
from what he saw on television <unk> <unk> points out that <unk> <unk> which collapsed and killed more than n commuters suffered serious damage while surrounding buildings appeared to sustain no damage whatsoever
he adds that they were aware of the propensity for earthquakes and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
the flamboyant and publicity - conscious <unk> <unk> says n he already has investigators looking into who could be held liable for the damage on the <unk> <unk> and the interstate approaching it
we wo n't know until the smoke clears but yes we looking into it he says
<unk> <unk> says <unk> he wants to know whether state or federal engineers or private companies could have prevented the damage
<unk> <unk> who was at <unk> <unk> for the <unk> <unk> <unk> night says n he has hired civil engineers to check out his own mildly damaged building and to investigate the bridge collapse
defense lawyers perhaps understandably say that plaintiffs lawyers taking such an approach will have little success in pursuing their claims though they add that the facts of each case must be looked at individually
a lot of this is going to be code - related says <unk> <unk> <unk> a construction law specialist at <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> law firm
plaintiffs he says n will argue that damaged structures were n't built to proper design standards
but if defendants can prove that they met <unk> <unk> stringent building codes that probably going to protect them <unk> <unk> says <unk>
government entities continues <unk> <unk> <unk> could be protected by the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
under the statute agencies are provided defenses that normally are n't available in the private sector <unk> <unk> says <unk>
the legislature does not want to inhibit the unique government activities by exposing public entities to liability
built into the statute are so - called design immunities which are likely to protect government agencies according to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> a lawyer with the <unk> <unk> of <unk> which oversees the damaged <unk> <unk>
the state is protected when plans and designs for public structures were approved ahead of time or when structures met previously approved standards says <unk> <unk> <unk>
he believes n those defenses might well apply to the <unk> <unk> collapse
nevertheless he adds i would n't get totally shocked if we get lawsuits out of the <unk> <unk>
if there going to be a race to the courthouse it has n't started yet
<unk> <unk> had to search through law books scattered on the floor of his office yesterday and <unk> <unk> courtyard was strewn with bricks
<unk> <unk> <unk> staff was n't permitted into his office by city officials worried about their safety
he said n he set up shop on the sidewalk in front of his town - house office and helped victims apply for federal aid free of charge
in a news release issued by <unk> <unk> the trial lawyers association also promised free assistance to victims
the association said <unk> it would monitor the conduct of lawyers and warned that solicitation of business is unethical
what in a name
apparently a lot according to the british firm of <unk> <unk> <unk>
the british firm has begun court proceedings in <unk> to prevent the use of the name <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and the rest of the world
the british <unk> firm recently withdrew from the merger of <unk> and <unk> world - wide and joined <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> senior partner of <unk> in the <unk> said the decision to start these proceedings has n't been taken lightly
<unk> <unk> said n the british firm has used the name <unk> since <unk>
in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was known as <unk> <unk> until <unk> when it added the <unk> name of its british affiliate
<unk> <unk> <unk> an accounting professor at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> said there a lot of emotion involved in the name of an accounting firm with a long history and with roots in <unk> where accounting predates the <unk>
although accountants are n't noted as being deeply emotional they really hold it all in said <unk> <unk> former chief accountant of the securities and <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> chairman of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> he believes the legal action by the british firm to be without merit
<unk> <unk> said that last <unk> the international executive committes of <unk> and <unk> agreed to a world - wide merger
the merger is proceeding according to plan except as to the withdrawal of the <unk> <unk> firm he said
partners at other accounting firms say that the <unk> firm in the <unk> is filing the suit to get even with the merged <unk> - <unk> firm for keeping major auditing work in <unk>
<unk> motors <unk> a <unk> audit client for example has agreed to keep its annual n million world - wide audit and associated tax work with the merged <unk> - <unk> firm n to be known as <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
in <unk> this would mean that the british <unk> would lose revenue for its audit of <unk> <unk> unit
the defection of <unk> affiliates in <unk> and the <unk> to <unk> <unk> will make <unk> one of the biggest accounting firms in <unk> rivaling <unk> <unk> <unk> there
although <unk> has n't been courted by other major accounting firms for a merger it is benefiting greatly from fallout from the <unk> - <unk> merger
in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> general counsel of <unk> said <unk> <unk> was aware of the litigation but he declined further comment
he also declined to comment on the name that <unk> would use in <unk> if <unk> <unk> won its litigation n to keep its name

he acknowledged however that <unk> drug - related murder rate is intolerably high
the prisons are too crowded
drugs continue to be sold openly around schools parks and housing projects
<unk> <unk> declined to name the area officials who he believes n have impeded plans for building more federal prisons to ease <unk> problem
but other <unk> administration officials have criticized <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for blocking the use of possible sites in that state
administration officials also have said that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has delayed consideration of sites in the city
in a letter to <unk> <unk> office released yesterday <unk> city administrator <unk> <unk> complained that the drug czar had exaggerated the amount of federal drug - related assistance provided to the capital
referring to <unk> <unk> claim that the federal government would provide n million in emergency federal support <unk> <unk> wrote our analysis was unable to even come close to documenting that figure
of his successes in <unk> <unk> <unk> stressed that existing federal prisons have taken custody of <unk> local inmates
he also noted that the federal <unk> <unk> <unk> has established a federal - local task force responsible since <unk> for n arrests and more than n million in seizures of drug dealers assets
the <unk> <unk> has lent the <unk> <unk> attorney n prosecutors and the <unk> <unk> of <unk> has provided crime laboratory facilities and training he added n
what if it happened to us
in the wake of the earthquake in <unk> and the devastation of <unk> <unk> many companies in disaster - prone areas are pondering the question of preparedness
some particularly in <unk> <unk> earthquake zones are dusting off their evacuation plans checking food stocks and reminding employees of what to do if emergency strikes
others say n they feel confident that steps n they already taken would see them through a disaster
preparedness involves more than flashlights and fire alarms these days
some big companies have teams of in - house experts focusing on safety and business resumption
many companies in the path of potential disaster have set up contingency offices in safe regions hoping n they can transport employees there and resume operations quickly
that means making sure that copies of vital computer software and company records are out of harm way
some businesses like <unk> claim that even if they became isolated in a crisis they would be able to feed and care for their people for as long as five days
self - sufficiency has to be the cornerstone of your plan says <unk> <unk> - <unk> manager of corporate emergency planning at <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>

you need to capitalize on these moments when you have everyone attention she says
it was a good reminder that we all need to prepare prior to an event
the <unk> memo urges employees to keep certain supplies at work such as solid shoes and heavy gloves n to clear debris
it also recommends that employees be aware of everyday office items that could be used for emergency care or shelter
among the suggestions <unk> and men ties could be used for slings while removable wooden shelves might aid in breaking through office walls
<unk> maintains an office in <unk> that would take over if payroll operations in <unk> were disrupted
two months ago the company set up a toll - free number based outside <unk> <unk> to handle queries from employees about when they should report back to work after an earthquake or other disaster
the <unk> plan takes into account such details as which aspects of business are busier at certain times of the year
this way depending on when a quake might strike priorities can be assigned to departments that should be brought back on line first
at <unk> - <unk> <unk> the earthquake came just as the company was reviewing its own emergency procedures

as it turned out bank employees were n't hurt and the vaults withstood the jolts

<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> third - quarter earnings report is reinforcing analysts belief that newspaper publishers will be facing continued poor earnings comparisons through n
the publisher was able to register soaring quarter net income because of a onetime gain on the sale of its cable - tv system
however operating profit fell <unk> to n million
the decline reflected the expense of buying three magazines lower earnings from the forest - products group and what is proving to be a nagging major problem continued declines in advertising linage at the <unk> <unk> <unk> the company flagship daily newspaper
in composite trading on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> closed at <unk> a share down n cents
analysts said n the company troubles mirror those of the industry
retail advertising which often represents half of the advertising volume at most daily newspapers largely is n't rebounding in the second half from extended doldrums as expected
at the same time newspapers are bedeviled by lagging national advertising especially in its financial component
<unk> <unk> <unk> recently reported <unk> net fell n a reflection in part of continued softness in financial advertising at the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> magazine
we expect next year to be a fairly soft year in newspaper - industry advertising said <unk> <unk> an analyst for <unk> <unk> <unk>
next year earnings will hold steady but we just do n't see a big turnaround in the trend in advertising

investors celebrated the second anniversary of <unk> <unk> with a buying spree in both stocks and bonds

the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> up about n points in mid - afternoon finished with a gain of <unk> points to <unk>
that brought the average cumulative gain this week to about <unk> points
since the <unk> crash the industrials have soared more than <unk> and the widely watched market barometer is about n below its record high set earlier this month
the stock - market rally was led by blue - chip issues but unlike <unk> rebound was broadly based

that news plus recent signs of economic sluggishness greatly increases pressure on the <unk> <unk> to ease credit further which in turn would be good news for stocks investment managers say n

despite the inflation news several <unk> officials still fear n consumer - price pressures will intensify because they insist <unk> the economy is stronger than generally believed

<unk> rout of a <unk> congressional hopeful in a <unk> district that has n't backed a democratic presidential candidate since <unk> <unk> is another reminder that at least at the federal level political ticket splitting has been on the rise over the past half century
in only one presidential election year prior to n did more than <unk> of the nation congressional districts choose a different party candidate for the <unk> <unk> than for the <unk> of representatives
now that percentage routinely equals a third and twice has been above n
as we know voters tend to favor republicans more in races for president than in those for <unk>
in every presidential election over the past half century except for the <unk> presidential candidacy the <unk> has captured a greater percentage of the major - party popular vote for president than it has of congressional seats or the popular vote for <unk>
prior to n the pattern was nearly the opposite
what accounts for the results of recent decades
a simple economic theory may provide at least a partial explanation for the split personality displayed by americans in the voting booth
the theory relies on three assumptions
n voters can buy one of two brands when they select their political agents a republican brand that believes in the minimalist state and in the virtues of private markets over the vices of public action and a democratic brand that believes in big government and in public intervention to remedy the excesses attendant to the pursuit of private interest
n congressional representatives have two basic responsibilities while voting in office dealing with national issues programmatic actions such as casting roll call votes on legislation that imposes costs and\/or confers benefits on the population at large and attending to local issues constituency service and pork barrel
n republican congressional representatives because of their belief in a minimalist state are less willing to engage in local benefit - seeking than are democratic members of <unk>
if these assumptions hold voters in races for <unk> face what in economic theory is called a prisoner dilemma and have an incentive at the margin to lean democratic
if they put a <unk> into office not only will they acquire less in terms of local benefits but their selected legislator will be relatively powerless to prevent other legislators from bringing home the bacon to their respective constituencies
each legislator after all is only one out of <unk> when it comes to national policy making
in races for the <unk> <unk> a voter incentive at the margin is to lean republican
although a <unk> president may limit local benefits to the voter particular district\/state such a president is also likely to be more effective at preventing other districts\/states and their legislators from bringing home the local benefits
the individual voter standing consequently will be enhanced through lower taxes
while this theory is exceedingly simple it appears to explain several things
first why ticket splitting has increased and taken the peculiar pattern that it has over the past half century prior to the election of <unk> <unk> as president and the advent of the <unk> <unk> government occupied a much smaller role in society and the prisoner dilemma problem confronting voters in races for <unk> was considerably less severe
second it explains why voters hold <unk> in disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives any individual legislator constituents appreciate the specific benefits that the legislator wins for them but not the overall cost associated with every other legislator doing likewise for his own constituency
third the theory suggests why legislators who pay too much attention to national policy making relative to local benefit - seeking have lower security in office
for example first - term members of the <unk> once the most vulnerable of incumbents have become virtually immune to defeat
the one exception to this recent trend was the defeat of <unk> of the <unk> freshman republicans brought into office in n by the <unk> revolution and running for re - election in <unk>
because these freshmen placed far more emphasis on their partisan role spreading the <unk> revolution in national policy making they were more vulnerable to defeat
fourth the theory indicates why the <unk> <unk> may have a difficult time attracting viable candidates for congressional office
potential candidates may be discouraged from running less by the congressional salary than by the prospect of defeat at the hands of a democratic opponent
to the extent that potential republican candidates and their financial backers realize that the congressional prisoner dilemma game works to their disadvantage the <unk> <unk> will be hindered in its attempts to field a competitive slate of congressional candidates
fifth the theory may provide at least a partial reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly pronounced in the <unk>
to the extent that democratic legislators from the <unk> have held a disproportionate share of power in <unk> since <unk> and have been able to translate such clout into relatively more local benefits for their respective constituencies voters in the <unk> have had an especially strong incentive to keep such democrats in office
finally the theory suggests why republicans generally have fared better in <unk> races than in campaigns for the <unk>
since local benefit - seeking matters more and national policy making matters less in the lower chamber of <unk> this is precisely the pattern n one would expect if republicans are less willing to engage in local benefit - seeking than their democratic counterparts
is there any empirical support for this theory
three pieces of evidence corroborate the key assumption that democratic legislators are more willing to engage in local benefit - seeking than their republican colleagues
first economists <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> find that <unk> senators turn back roughly n more of their allocated personal staff budgets than democrats do
to the extent that the primary duty of personal staff involves local benefit - seeking this indicates that political philosophy leads congressional republicans to pay less attention to narrow constituent concerns
second if the key assumption is valid democrats should have lower attendance rates on roll - call votes than republicans do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time n a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit - seeking
this is indeed what the data indicate particularly in the case of the <unk>
the democratic <unk> attendance rate has not exceeded the republican <unk> attendance rate since n
finally as shown in the table democrats allocate a higher proportion of their personal staffs to district offices where local benefit - seeking duties matter more and national policy making activities matter less relative to <unk> offices
an examination of changes in personal staffing decisions in the <unk> between <unk> and <unk> when control of that body changed party hands moreover reveals that the personal staffing differences noted in the table can not be attributed to the disproportionate control <unk> democrats exercise due to their majority - party status over other resources such as committee staff
an additional piece of evidence from the <unk> <unk> other factors constant such as incumbency advantages and regional factors the difference between popular votes for republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states conducting a <unk> election turns out to be a positive function of how onerous the federal government tax burden is per state a progressive tax rate hits higher - income states harder
put more simply <unk> candidates for president are looked on more kindly by voters than republican candidates for the <unk> when the prisoner dilemma is more severe
moreover ticket splitting appears to take the same peculiar pattern at the state government level as it does at the federal level
state government is more typically split along <unk> - governor\/democratic-legislature lines than the reverse
a cross - state econometric investigation furthermore reveals that holding other factors constant the difference between a state major - party vote going to the republican gubernatorial candidate and the republican share of the lower state house is a positive function of the state tax rate
in sum at both the federal and state government levels at least part of the seemingly irrational behavior n voters display in the voting booth may have an exceedingly rational explanation
<unk> <unk> teaches at the <unk> of <unk> <unk> business school
a <unk> - <unk> conference approved a nearly n billion <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> bill that makes federal reparations for japanese - americans held in <unk> <unk> <unk> internment camps a legal entitlement after next <unk> n
the measure provides no money for the promised payments until then but beginning in fiscal <unk> the government would be committed to meeting annual payments of as much as n million until the total liability of approximately n billion is paid
the action abandons earlier efforts to find offsetting cuts n to fund the payments but is widely seen as a more realistic means of expediting reparations first authorized in <unk>
the action came as <unk> sent to <unk> <unk> a fiscal n bill providing an estimated n billion for the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> services
final approval was on a n roll call in the <unk> which sets the stage for a veto confrontation with <unk> <unk> over the issue of publicly financed abortions for poor women
reversing an eight - year federal policy the measure supports <unk> abortions in cases of rape and incest but <unk> <unk> has so far refused to support any specific exemption beyond instances in which the mother life is in danger
<unk> <unk> veto power puts him a commanding position in the narrowly divided <unk> but a vote to override his position could well pick up new support because of the wealth of health and education programs financed in the underlying bill
the measure before the conference yesterday funds the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> through fiscal <unk>
an estimated n billion is provided for next year census and negotiators stripped a <unk> - passed rider seeking to block the counting of illegal aliens
elsewhere in the <unk> <unk> nearly n million is preserved for assistance programs under the <unk> <unk> <unk>
and in a footnote to the fall of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> this year the conference voted to rescind n million in unspent <unk> funds for a <unk> <unk> <unk> stockyards project that figured in ethics charges against the former democratic leader
fiscal pressures also forced the adoption of new fees charged by federal agencies and an n increase in the securities and <unk> <unk> budget would be financed entirely by an added n million in filing fees
in an unprecedented step the measure anticipates another n million in receipts by having the <unk> <unk> of <unk> charge for fingerprint services in civil cases a change that is almost certain to increase <unk> costs in processing personnel and security clearances
the bill does n't include an estimated n billion in supplemental anti - drug funds for <unk> <unk> and law - enforcement accounts that are still in conference with the <unk>
but yesterday agreement would make it easier for state governments to handle the promised aid by deferring for one year a scheduled n increase in the required state matching funds for law - enforcement grants
similarly the measure adjusts the current funding formula to promise smaller states such as <unk> <unk> and <unk> a minimum allocation of n million each in drug grants or three times the current minimum
the odd mix of departments in the bill makes it one of the more eclectic of the annual appropriations measures and the assorted provisions attached by lawmakers run from n million for a fish farm in <unk> to a music festival in <unk> under the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
lawmakers scrapped all of a n million <unk> <unk> request for the <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> but agreed elsewhere to <unk> for an oil portrait of former <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who also chairs the <unk> appropriations subcommittee for the department attached n million for an advanced technology initiative including work on high - definition television
his republican counterpart <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has used his position to wage a legislative war with the conservative board of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
an estimated n million is provided to maintain the program but <unk> <unk> also succeeded in attaching language seeking to curb the authority of the current board until new members are confirmed
the effective date of any new regulations by the current board would be delayed until <unk> n next year and the bill seeks to reverse efforts by the corporation to cut off funds to service organizations such as the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
the bill also provides n million n to meet <unk> contributions to international organizations and n million for peace - keeping activities
both accounts reflect significant increases from fiscal n although the amount for peace - keeping shows a n cut from the administration request
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> it retained <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as its lead investment banker n to advise it regarding a possible sale or other combination of the <unk> <unk> <unk> thrift
<unk> which has assets of more than n billion and n branches in <unk> said n the action to improve its regulatory capital position is related directly to new capital requirements mandated by recently adopted federal legislation
<unk> also said n it extended its two - year advisory relationship with <unk> securities of <unk> <unk>
<unk> stock closed yesterday at <unk> unchanged in composite trading on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
watching <unk> sweat and grimace through its annual budget labors fighting the urge to spend more we reminded of those late - night movies in which the anguished serial killer turns himself in to police and says stop me before i kill again
the members know n they doing wrong but they need help to restrain their darker compulsions
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> spilled his guts on the <unk> floor the other day after he joined the <unk> <unk> early - morning pork - barrel revels i must tell you
i come to the floor tonight as one who ended up with a busload of extraneous matter
it was nothing more or nothing less than a feeding frenzy
he was turning himself in
frankly as i was walking back to get in my car i heard many many people opening champagne bottles and celebrating individual victories that some of us had accomplished in getting our little deal in the tax bill and winking at this person for slipping this in he said
as i was driving home i did not feel very good about myself
we can applaud <unk> <unk> moment of epiphany even as we understand that he and his confreres need restraint lest they kill again
a good place <unk> to start the rehabilitation is a legislative line - item veto bill now being offered by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the <unk> bill which already has n <unk> <unk> - sponsors is n't a pure line - item veto because it would apply only to spending bills
instead it a form of enhanced rescission giving a <unk> a chance to rescind or strike specific spending items that just go too far
under the proposal a <unk> would have a chance twice each year to return a package of rescissions to the <unk> once when he proposes his budget and again after <unk> disposes
<unk> would have <unk> days n to reject the package with a n majority but then a <unk> could veto that rejection
<unk> would then need the usual two - thirds majority n to override any veto
the proposal would restore some discipline erased from the budget process by the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
before <unk> a <unk> could impound or refuse to spend funds appropriated by <unk>
presidents <unk> and <unk> were both big users of the impoundment power but <unk> saw its chance against a weakened <unk> <unk> and stripped it away
today a <unk> can still send up spending rescissions but they meaningless unless <unk> has a guilty conscience and changes its mind
this is like asking foxes to feel remorse about chickens and naturally rescissions are almost never approved
in <unk> <unk> <unk> sent n rescissions back to the <unk> but only n of the spending total was approved by <unk>
<unk> <unk> proposal would let the proposed spending cuts take place automatically unless <unk> acts
the members could still try to serve their constituents with special - interest goodies but the police in the form of a <unk> would be there with a straitjacket if they really get crazy as they do now
<unk> <unk> plans to offer his proposal as an amendment to a bill <unk> to raise the federal debt limit before the end of the month
<unk> <unk> has endorsed the idea and at least n sitting senators have voted to support enhanced rescission authority in the past
we told <unk> <unk> <unk> is n't yet a co - sponsor but if he and his colleagues are serious about kicking their compulsions they sign up
business and civic operations lurched back toward normalcy here as congressional officials estimated that the price tag for emergency assistance to earthquake - ravaged <unk> would total at least n billion
that is a minimum figure and i underscore minimum said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> after conferring with <unk> lawmakers
it impossible to put an exact figure on it at this time
the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> has begun looking into legislation n to provide more funds for earthquake repairs
and <unk> <unk> delegation in the <unk> is expected to propose that emergency funds be added to a stop - gap spending bill that the <unk> <unk> <unk> is to consider <unk>
for the most part major corporations headquarters and plants were unaffected or only slightly damaged by <unk> earthquake which registered n on the <unk> scale
one of the last big employers in the <unk> <unk> <unk> to report in <unk> <unk> said <unk> it expects to be back at full strength <unk>
the day before the quake <unk> completed three days of emergency training and drills
echoing the response of almost all big corporations in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> chief financial officer said i would n't expect this to have any significant financial impact
the city recovery from the earthquake was uneven
banks indicated n they were operating at greater than <unk> of their usual capacity but a <unk> <unk> hotel said n tourists had fled leaving the previously full hotel with an n vacancy rate
<unk> crews tallied the wreckage to buildings but lacked a clear sense of how gravely transportation arteries were disabled
among the city banks <unk> of <unk> said n all but eight of its n branches were open
the closed branches in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> sustained structural damage
power failures kept just seven of its <unk> automated - teller machines off - line
securities - trading operations were moved to <unk> of <unk> <unk> office and foreign - exchange trading operations were shifted to <unk> <unk> the bank said <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> its <unk> <unk> <unk> which met all night <unk> moved its global - funds transfer system to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> miles to the south
only five of n branches statewide remain closed while <unk> of <unk> automated - teller machines remained out of order
the most extensive damage was in small towns near the quake epicenter <unk> miles south of <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> estimates total damage at nearly n million
<unk> <unk> <unk> has a running total so far of n million excluding the hard - hit city of <unk> <unk>
<unk> officials were still uncertain about the magnitude of structural damage late yesterday a section of <unk> a twotiered highway collapsed in <unk> causing a majority of the deaths resulting from the quake
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> estimated that damages to the city total <unk> billion
that includes dwellings in the ravaged <unk> district that must be demolished peeled business facades south of <unk> <unk> and houses in the city outer <unk> district that were heaved off their foundations
many streets and sidewalks buckled and subterranean water mains and service connections ruptured
the federal funds would go to a range of programs including the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> highway construction accounts and the <unk> <unk> <unk> according to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> which coordinates federal disaster relief is already strapped by the costs of cleaning up after <unk> <unk> which hit the carolinas last month
it is likely to get as much as n million initially in additional funds and eventually could get more than n billion according to <unk> <unk> a member of the <unk> appropriations <unk>
<unk> <unk> spokesman <unk> <unk> said n there is enough money on hand n to deal with immediate requirements
the <unk> administration has at its disposal n million in funds remaining from the <unk> billion <unk> <unk> released for the cleanup after <unk> <unk>
we feel n we have the money necessary to handle the immediate short - term requirements <unk> <unk> said
he added that the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> the <unk> <unk> and other agencies are developing longer - term legislation that should be ready soon
much of the cost of cleaning up after the earthquake will involve repairing highways and bridges
<unk> lawmakers are seeking changes in rules governing the federal highway relief program so more money can be made available for the state
some things ca n't be repaired
the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> reports <unk> million to n million in damage including shattered porcelains and stone figures
its neighbor the <unk> <unk> <unk> totaled <unk> million to n million in structural damage and shattered sculpture
the city main library is closed because of fissures that opened in its walls and marble facings and ornamental plaster at the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> broke off in the temblor
the ground along the <unk> the street that skirts the city eastern boundary and piers dropped six inches after the quake wreaking major damage to at least one of the piers
at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> shock waves wrecked the control tower knocking down computers and shattering glass
offices of the city <unk> <unk> were destroyed
<unk> <unk> <unk> billion estimate does n't include damage to freeway arteries leading into the city some of which remained closed
a major chunk of the <unk> billion is expected to be eaten up by overtime for city workers deployed in the emergency said <unk> a spokesman for <unk> <unk>
all of the city n million emergency reserve was spent in the first n hours on overtime salaries he said n
insurers struggled to to get a firm grasp on the volume of claims pouring into their offices
at <unk> <unk> <unk> a spokesman said n n claims were received in the first n hours after the quake and the company is braced for as many as <unk> claims from its n residential and n business policyholders in the affected area
claims range from a scratched fender and there were an awful lot of cars damaged in this to a major processing plant a spokesman said
we delivering a check for <unk> to an automotive business in <unk> that burned on <unk>
<unk> is part of a n million syndicate that supplies business interruption insurance to the city on the <unk> <unk> which must pay employees during the three weeks or more n it is expected to be out of service and deprived of toll income
<unk> lawmakers want to eliminate temporarily a n million cap on the amount of federal highway relief for each state for each disaster as well as a prohibition on using the emergency highway aid to repair toll roads
in addition under the highway - relief program the federal government provides n of emergency highway aid for only the first <unk> days of a repair effort
after that the federal share diminishes
for interstate highways the federal share normally would drop to <unk> of the cost of repairs and the state would have to pick up the remainder of the cost
but lawmakers want to extend the period for n federal funding for several months
those changes also would apply to two areas hit hard by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> according to an aide to <unk> <unk>
meanwhile the <unk> announced a toll - free telephone number n n to expedite service to victims of the earthquake
lines will be available n hours a day n to take applications for such disaster relief as temporary housing and emergency home repairs by phone
transportation officials are expecting utter traffic pandemonium beginning <unk> and growing worse over the next several weeks
some n cars normally cross the closed <unk> <unk> between <unk> and <unk> <unk> daily
officials say n it is clear that alternate routes ca n't handle the overflow
the state is calling in a flotilla of navy landing vessels and other boats n to expand ferry service across the bay and hopes to add numerous new bus routes and train departures to help alleviate the traffic problem
moreover state officials are urging freight haulers to bypass many of the area main highways and to travel late at night or during predawn hours
even so we looking for chaos said <unk> <unk> <unk> a deputy district director at the <unk> <unk> of <unk>
if there any way n you can do it you ought to go to <unk> and go fishing for a while
most of <unk> <unk> tourists and business travelers already have left despite hotel offers of rate cuts
everyone left said <unk> <unk> reservations manager of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
the <unk> <unk> <unk> hotel which survived the <unk> earthquake and fire currently is less than n occupied
we still have our die - hard baseball fans a spokesman said
one lady from <unk> <unk> said n she not going home until the <unk> <unk> is over
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> in <unk> contributed to this article
is an american <unk> of <unk> seriously suggesting that the <unk> <unk> should help govern <unk>
apparently so
there are no easy choices in <unk> but we ca n't imagine that it benefits the <unk> to become the catalyst for an all - too-familiar process that could end in another round of horror in <unk>
now that <unk> appears to have pulled out its occupation army the <unk> <unk> is talking again about accepting an interim coalition government in the cambodian capital of <unk> <unk>
the coalition would include the current <unk> - backed <unk> <unk> regime the two non - communist resistance groups led by <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk>
the aim would be to end the guerrilla war for control of <unk> by allowing the <unk> <unk> a small share of power
the <unk> <unk> says that any <unk> <unk> participation would have to be minimal
the usual problem with including communists in interim coalition governments is that their ideology and methods require n they squeeze out everyone else
recall that <unk> sandinistas came into <unk> as partners in a coalition government with anti - <unk> moderates
within two years the moderates were exiled or in prison <unk> had gone communist and the sandinistas were building one of the biggest armies in <unk> <unk> and threatening their neighbors
in <unk> when the western powers bowed to pressure for such a coalition it turned out n they were opening the door to communist domination
even <unk> <unk> - <unk> <unk> began in <unk> with a partnership between the communists and a number of smaller non - communist parties
what complicates the scene in <unk> is that the current regime is already communist as are its vietnamese overseers back in <unk> as are the <unk> <unk> who are the strongest of the three guerrilla groups
it not clear which crew of communists might prevail in a coalition government but the one good bet is that the non - communists would disappear
that would leave <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk>
the <unk> <unk> regime has sent thousands of conscript laborers to die of malaria and malnourishment while building <unk> equivalent of the <unk> <unk> near the <unk> border
the <unk> <unk> however carry an unsurpassed record for cambodian tyranny
these utopians caused the deaths by starvation disease or execution of well over one million cambodians
the cambodian horror was so bad that the vietnamese occupation in <unk> was a perverse form of relief
the world might want to believe that the <unk> <unk> ca n't still be such bad guys just as in the late <unk> it was reluctant to credit the reports of genocide then taking place
but there is no solid evidence that the <unk> <unk> have changed
some of our sources in <unk> say n the notorious old <unk> <unk> leader <unk> <unk> has been holed up this summer in <unk> <unk> camps near the <unk> - <unk> border
so it difficult to swallow the notion that <unk> <unk> is willing to accept conditions that would help the <unk> <unk> set up shop again in <unk> <unk>
true <unk> <unk> backs the idea of such a coalition at least for this week
but <unk> <unk> has backed all sorts of ideas over the years and done rather better by himself than by <unk>
nor should the <unk> worry much about offending <unk> which still aids the <unk> <unk>
it time <unk> the <unk> <unk> recognized that <unk> does not play by gentlemen rules
for the <unk> to lend even the slightest support to the most infamous killers on <unk> bleak scene could only disturb <unk> allies elsewhere
it would be entirely rational for communist insurgents in countries such as the <unk> or <unk> to conclude the following <unk> viciously enough and the <unk> under the banner of pragmatism might eventually help negotiate your way to victory
<unk> diplomacy has done it before and it will likely do it again
the administration and <unk> have lately tangoed around the idea of sending military aid to <unk> non - communists
but now the possibility of diplomatic movement <unk> withdrawal the <unk> initiative has put that plan on hold with the proviso that if the going got rough the <unk> would then rearm the opposition
why the timidity
at the very least the odds are heavily weighted against the prospects of preventing the <unk> <unk> and <unk> communists from ultimately moving against their opponents
when that day comes it would be particularly awful to know that the <unk> <unk> sat on military aid and deprived these people of the means n to settle their fate with at least a little honor
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was named executive vice president <unk> <unk> for the <unk> <unk> the business newspaper published by this company that also has interests in book publishing fine china oil services and investment banking

as the ad tone implies the <unk> spirit is pretty xenophobic these days and <unk> <unk> is n't alone in trying to take advantage of that
from <unk> trucks to <unk> iced tea to a host of battling banks the state has been inundated with broadcast commercials and print advertising campaigns celebrating texans and castigating outsiders
while advertisers have long appealed to texans state pride and prejudices the latest trend has been sparked in part by the state recent hard economic times
that has taken some of the swagger out of natives who like to brag that <unk> is the only state that was once a nation but it has increased their legendary resentment of outsiders
in the past writes <unk> <unk> <unk> columnist <unk> <unk> outlanders were accepted only after passing a series of tests <unk> to prove <unk> they had the right <unk> attitudes and of course they had to be dipped for parasites
there is no small irony in the fact that some of the most - jingoistic advertising comes courtesy of you guessed it outsiders
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> parent for instance hails from <unk> <unk>

all kinds of landmark <unk> real estate has been snapped up by out - of-staters
even the beloved <unk> cowboys were bought by an <unk> oil man
<unk> has lost its distinctiveness leaving texans with a hunger to feel proud about themselves says <unk> <unk> a sociology professor at <unk> <unk> <unk>
this plays right into the hands of the advertising agencies

real texans do n't play paddleball at least i hope not

in the third quarter last year <unk> had net income of n million or n cents a share on sales of n million
<unk> <unk> attributed the earnings slide to new product delays such as a laptop scheduled for <unk> that wo n't be introduced until early <unk>
some delays have been caused by a shortage of micoprocessors notably <unk> <unk> newest chip the <unk> but others apparently have been caused by <unk> explosive growth and thinly stretched resources
they got a lot of different balls in the air at the same time observes <unk> <unk> a computer securities analyst with <unk> - based <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>

product delays however have left <unk> buffeted by harsher competition in its bread - and-butter line of desktop computers as powerhouse competitors <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> machines <unk> price their pcs more aggressively
the result has been thinner margins which have been further eroded by an ambitious research and development effort and rapid overseas expansion
<unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> believes <unk> <unk> response has been to place increased emphasis on product quality in an effort to rise above some of that price pressure
but that has been the key to <unk> success he adds n whereas <unk> carved out its market niche as a direct seller of low - cost but reliable computers and it might be too late in the game for a shift in strategy

the incentives boosted sales for a while but the pace had cooled by last month
the result <unk> dealers had a bloated <unk> supply of the <unk> as of the end of last month and a <unk> supply of the <unk> pickup which <unk> also builds
a n to <unk> supply is considered normal

to be economically feasible the n billion canadian dollar <unk> n billion project requires almost a doubling of natural gas export prices
it also faces numerous other hurdles including an agreement on a pipeline route for the gas
the board said <unk> the export licenses would be issued on the condition that canadian interests would also be allowed to bid for the <unk> delta gas on terms similar to those offered to <unk> customers
<unk> buyers have already been lined up
they include <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the project could result in the <unk> taking more than n of its natural gas supplies from <unk> up from about <unk> currently
it would bring <unk> gas fields into production at a combined rate of about <unk> billion cubic feet a day
the board estimated that the cost of building a pipeline from the <unk> delta to <unk> would be about c$ n million

where do americans put their money
it depends on when you look
in <unk> for instance less than n of assets went into bank deposits
that rose to nearly n during the depression and has n't changed much since
pension reserves on the other hand made up a relatively small part of household assets until the last decade when they skyrocketed
and there has been a drastic decline in the importance of unincorporated business assets thanks to industry consolidation and a decline in family farms
that some of what emerges from the following charts which show how americans have changed their investment patterns over the past <unk> years
some results are self - explanatory
but other figures are surprising
housing for instance has remained a fairly steady component of household assets over the past decade although common wisdom would have expected an increase
there is a lot of attention paid to housing as a form of household wealth says <unk> <unk> <unk> professor of economics at <unk> <unk> <unk>
but it has n't increased much relative to other assets
it suggests that households accumulate wealth across a broad spectrum of assets
and housing though it appears in the popular mind as being the major growing household asset is n't
in addition investors desire to hold stocks directly and through mutual funds has held surprisingly steady stocks importance among assets largely reflects the ups and downs of the stock market and not a shift in stock - holding preferences
stocks have not spread to the general public despite the fact that the environment is much different concludes <unk> <unk> an economist at <unk> <unk>
to me it says that despite all the views that we spend too much of our wealth on paper assets we have ways of holding wealth similar to n years ago

<unk> which has agreed with <unk> <unk> to merge their cellular - telephone businesses said then that it would n't take a position on <unk> revised tender offer
earlier this month <unk> revised its offer to <unk> a share for n million <unk> shares
<unk> is seeking n of the cellular and broadcasting concern the revised offer includes a feature requiring <unk> to begin an auction process in <unk> <unk> that would buy out remaining holders at a per - share price roughly equivalent to what a third party might then have to pay for all of <unk>
the letter outlines broad powers for an independent group of directors provided for in the revised offer
in a statement <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman and chief executive officer of <unk> said we trust <unk> <unk> will take no further actions that favor <unk>
<unk> said n the three independent directors provided for in the offer would be designated by the current board
the successors would be nominated by the independent directors
<unk> would have a priority right to pursue all opportunities to acquire <unk> cellular interests in markets other than those in which <unk> holds an interest or which are contiguous to those markets unless <unk> has an interest there or contiguous to it
independent directors would have veto rights to any acquisition if they unanimously decide n it is n't in <unk> best interest
independent directors would be able to block transactions n they unanimously deem n would be likely to depress the private market value of <unk> at the time n it is to be sold in five years
if <unk> is put up for sale rather than purchased by <unk> in five years <unk> wo n't submit a bid unless the independent directors request it and the independent directors will run the bidding
the directors would be able to sell particular assets to enable such buyers as the regional <unk> operating companies to purchase the company interests

here then is where the <unk> workers have come to make apartheid last stand
their idea is to create a city first and then an entire nation without blacks
this may seem to be a preposterous and utterly futile effort in <unk>

but their ideal of an afrikaner homeland an all - white reserve n to be carved out of present - day <unk> <unk> is a mainstream desire of the right - wing which embraces about one - third of the country five million whites

we must either integrate honestly or segregate honestly
<unk> has long been a special domain of <unk>
according to <unk> <unk> the early afrikaner pioneers were the first people n to settle in the eastern <unk> even before the blacks
then when <unk> was incorporated in <unk> the farmer who owned the land stipulated that only whites could reside in town blacks could work there but they had to leave at night
today <unk> is a town of <unk> whites and two paved roads

if you think <unk> earnings will grow at <unk> a year it all right to pay <unk> times earnings he says
but do n't pay <unk> times earnings for a company that expected to grow at <unk> a year
<unk> <unk> thinks <unk> the market will probably go higher but will be ruthless with stocks if the earnings are n't there
<unk> <unk> cautions that investors should n't slavishly follow any specific price\/earnings sell trigger
if you say sell anytime <unk> a company price\/earnings ratio exceeds n that knocks out all your growth stocks he says
you eliminate companies with substantial prospects that are moving up in price

<unk> <unk> reported a n jump in third - quarter earnings as its rocket - like recovery from nearly ruinous losses several years ago continued to be fueled by growth in consumer loans higher interest margins and negligible loan losses
for the quarter <unk> said <unk> it earned n million or <unk> a share compared with n million or n cents a share a year earlier
<unk> spokesmen said <unk> preliminary reports indicate n the company was n't materially affected by the <unk> earthquake
all but eight of the <unk> branches which had some structural damage reopened yesterday for business
automated teller machine operations also were up and operating yesterday a bank spokesman said n
for the first time in nearly two years <unk> results failed to improve in consecutive quarters but the decline from the second quarter was attributable to special factors
third - quarter profit was n below the n million or <unk> a share earned in the <unk> second quarter
the company cited higher tax credits in the second quarter totaling n million compared with n million in the third quarter
excluding tax credits profit was n below the second quarter
but that drop was caused entirely by a decline in brazilian interest paid to n million from n million the second quarter
moreover <unk> continued to build its reserve against troubled foreign loans by boosting its loan - loss provision to n million about the same as the previous quarter but well above the n million in the year - earlier quarter
the provision rate was far above <unk> actual net credit losses of n million in the third quarter compared with n million in the second period and n million a year earlier
as a result <unk> said <unk> its reserve against troubled foreign - country loans once below <unk> now amounts to n of the <unk> billion of non - trade debt n it calculates n it is owed by those nations
that level is about the same as some other big banks but far below the <unk> and <unk> reserves of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> respectively
by any measure third - quarter earnings were still robust equivalent to a n return on assets even excluding tax credits
by that key measure of operating efficiency <unk> turned in a better performance than its well - regarded <unk> <unk> - based competitor <unk> <unk> <unk> which posted a n return in the third quarter
but it continued to badly trail its <unk> <unk> neighbor <unk> <unk> <unk> which reported an extraordinary n return on assets
both returns do n't include any tax credits
they <unk> continue to show good performance said <unk> <unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
in composite trading yesterday on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> common stock edged up <unk> cents to close at <unk> a share

the n net interest margin or the difference between the yield on a bank investments and the rate <unk> it pays for deposits and other borrowings was still markedly higher than the <unk> ratio a year earlier and is among the best in the industry analysts said n
the high margin partly stems from continued strong growth in high - yielding consumer loans which jumped <unk> to n billion from a year earlier and residential mortgages which rose <unk> to n billion

many plant floors currently resemble a <unk> of <unk> with computers robots and machine tools that generally speak their own language and have trouble talking to each other
as a result if a problem develops on a production line it is unlikely n some supervisor sitting in front of a personal computer or workstation will know about it or be able to correct it
so <unk> will be announcing more than <unk> products that will be aimed at letting even the dumbest machine tool talk to the smartest mainframe or anything in between
in an unusual display of openness <unk> also will be helping customers tie together operations that include lots of equipment made by <unk> competitors
in addition the executives said <unk> <unk> will be offering programming tools designed to let anyone working on a factory floor write ad - hoc software for instance n to do statistical analysis that would pinpoint a problem on a manufacturing line
in <unk> <unk> an <unk> spokeswoman confirmed that <unk> executives will be announcing some computer - integrated-manufacturing plans next week but declined to elaborate
the industry executives said that as usual with such broad announcements from <unk> this one will be part reality and part strategy
so it will take many quarters for <unk> to roll out all the products that customers need and it will take years for customers to integrate the products into their operations
also as usual the products will appeal mostly to heavy users of <unk> equipment at least initially
still consultants and industry executives said <unk> the products could help make manufacturing operations more efficient and provide a boost to the computer - integrated-manufacturing market a market that <unk> <unk> a research firm has said n may double to n billion by n
this is a step in the right direction said <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> analyst
he added though that a lot of this is intentions
we have to wait and see how the plan develops
the announcements also should help <unk> go on the offensive against <unk> <unk> <unk> on the plant floor
while <unk> has traditionally dominated the market for computers on the business side of manufacturing operations and has done well in the market for design tools <unk> has dominated computerized manufacturing
<unk> - <unk> <unk> also has begun to gain share in the whole computer - integrated-manufacturing arena
<unk> will face an uphill climb against <unk> given <unk> reputation for being better than <unk> at hooking together different manufacturers computers
in addition <unk> - <unk> while a much smaller player has made a big commitment to the sorts of industry standards that facilitate those hookups and could give <unk> some problems
both can be expected to go after the market aggressively <unk> <unk> <unk> a research firm estimated <unk> the <unk> gets <unk> of its revenue from the manufacturing market and <unk> - <unk> gets n
<unk> which <unk> <unk> said <unk> generates n of its revenue in this market should be able to take advantage of its loyal following among buyers of equipment
that is because many companies will standardize on certain types of equipment as the various parts of the manufacturing market merge and <unk> is the biggest player
but much will depend on how quickly <unk> can move
the whole idea of computer - integrated manufacturing <unk> seems to be making a comeback after losing a little luster over the past couple of years when it became apparent that it was n't a panacea that would make <unk> plants more efficient and banish foreign competition
<unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> analyst said n organizational changes may still be required to really take advantage of <unk> capabilities someone on the shop floor may not like having someone in an office using a personal computer to look over his shoulder for instance and may be able to prevent that from happening
but he said <unk> a system such as <unk> should help significantly
in making polyethylene sheets out of plastic chips for instance a chip sometimes does n't melt gets caught in the machinery and creates a run in the sheets
that can be expensive because the problem may not be noticed for a while and the sheets are typically thrown away
but <unk> <unk> said that if computers can be integrated into the process they could alert an operator as soon as the problem occurred
they could also check through the orders on file to find a customer that was willing to accept a lower grade of polyethylene
the computer would let the machine run just until that order was filled eliminating waste
this sort of improved link figures to eventually become a significant weapon for some companies
companies might be able to tell salespeople daily for instance about idle equipment so they could offer discounts on whatever that equipment produces
salespeople also could get a precise reading on when products could be delivered in much the same way that <unk> <unk> has marketed its ability to tell exactly where a package is in the delivery system
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the company first new car franchise in the <unk> since the <unk> was unveiled in <unk> now will share <unk> fate
<unk> said yesterday n it will halt imports of the <unk> <unk> a <unk> luxury sedan built by <unk> of <unk> in <unk> <unk>
the cars are sold under a separate franchise with its own sign in front of <unk> - <unk> dealers as opposed to new models such as <unk> or <unk> which are sold under existing <unk> divisions
the move to halt imports announced n years and n months to the day after <unk> <unk> <unk> declared that the <unk> division and its gawky car would be scrapped kills the four - year-old <unk> brand in the <unk> market
it will continue to be sold in the european market
<unk> death is n't nearly as costly to <unk> as was the <unk> debacle because <unk> was a relatively low - budget project with limited sales goals
still <unk> demise is a setback for <unk> at a time when the company image as the <unk> auto maker with the golden touch is showing signs of strain
the no . n auto maker new <unk> and <unk> <unk> models have n't met sales expectations in the year since they were introduced and <unk> trucks are losing ground to their <unk> rivals
this fall <unk> introduced only one new product a restyled version of its hulking <unk> <unk> <unk> luxury model
the demise of <unk> pronounced mare - <unk> comes after a <unk> in which <unk> <unk> dealers managed to sell only <unk> <unk>
total <unk> sales for the first nine months dropped <unk> from a year ago to just n cars
<unk> is n't the only european luxury brand having problems in the <unk>
the japanese assault on the luxury market is rapidly overshadowing such european makes as <unk> and <unk> which at least have clear brand images
<unk> as an import on domestic car lots suffered from the same sort of image confusion that is hobbling sales of imports at <unk> motors <unk> and <unk> <unk>

it was downhill from there however
one major factor was the decline of the dollar against the mark which began less than a year after <unk> <unk> launch
as the west german currency rose so did <unk> prices
the <unk> cars also suffered from spotty quality some dealers say n
it was like a comedy of errors says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a big dealer whose <unk> <unk> - <unk> operation in <unk> <unk> sold more n than any other dealership
but by the third quarter of <unk> <unk> had a high satisfaction rating in internal <unk> studies a spokesman said n
apparently however the improvement came too late
last fall <unk> announced n it would discontinue the n in the <unk> at the end of the <unk> model year
<unk> said then n it would keep the <unk>
this year <unk> sales plummeted and at the current sales pace it would take <unk> <unk> days to sell off the current <unk> inventory of about <unk> cars

after more than <unk> years something new has happened to pencils said <unk> <unk> <unk> in a <unk> report that publicly described the previously secret item
eagle plastic type sharpens and looks like a wooden pencil
a major difference is that a snapped wooden pencil will have a slivered break while a plastic model will break cleanly
the softness of the core constrains the plastic models to no . n no . n or no . n pencils which account for the bulk of the market

margins are the difference between the yield on the company earning assets and its own cost of funds
but a reduction in one - time gains on the sale of various assets and an increase in the company provision for loan losses held down the earnings gain the company said n
great western provision for loan losses was increased to n million for the recent quarter compared with n million a year ago primarily as a result of continued weakness in various commercial and multifamily real estate markets outside <unk>

third - quarter sales of <unk> credit services were disappointingly below sales of a year earlier <unk> <unk> said <unk>
as previously reported those sales have been declining this year in the wake of allegations that the company engaged in unfair sales practices that encouraged customers to overpurchase services

<unk> - <unk> <unk> exceeding some analysts expectations said <unk> third - quarter earnings rose n to n million or <unk> a share from n million or <unk> a share in the year - earlier period
sales increased <unk> to n billion from n billion
per - share earnings were enhanced by the company share buy - back program which reduced the average shares outstanding to n million in the quarter from n million in the same quarter of <unk>
with strong prices in the company two major areas building products as well as pulp and paper analysts had expected a roaring quarter
but the performance exceeded some estimates of around <unk> a share
fueling the growth among other things were higher - than-expected prices for certain building products

the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> approved a bill that would give the <unk> <unk> power to block airline leveraged buy - outs despite a clear veto threat from the <unk> administration
the <unk> vote clears the way for consideration on the <unk> floor next week or the week after
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a letter to the committee warned that he would urge <unk> <unk> to veto the legislation if it passed <unk>
the <unk> <unk> <unk> already has approved similar legislation
on <unk> a letter from <unk> <unk> deputy <unk> <unk> said <unk> the administration opposed the legislation in its present form
some of the bill supporters had taken heart from the fact that the letter was n't signed by <unk> <unk> and that it did n't contain a veto threat
the stepped - up administration warnings annoyed some lawmakers especially senior republicans who supported the bill because they thought <unk> the <unk> <unk> favored it
we backed this bill because we thought <unk> it would help <unk> one <unk> said and now we out there dangling in the wind
a few weeks ago <unk> <unk> testified before <unk> that it would be cleaner more efficient if he had authority to block buy - outs in advance
but he never took an official position on the bill and has steadfastly maintained that he already has enough authority to deal with buy - outs
under the committee bill the <unk> secretary would have n days and an additional n days if needed to review any proposed purchase of <unk> or more of a major <unk> airline voting stock
the secretary would be required to block an acquisition if he concluded that it would so weaken an airline financially that it would hurt safety or reduce the carrier ability to compete or if it gave control to a foreign interest
although the legislation would apply to any acquisition of a major airline it is aimed at transactions financed by large amounts of debt
supporters of the bill are concerned n an airline might sacrifice costly safety measures in order to repay debt
the panel action occurs in a politically charged atmosphere surrounding recent buy - out proposals their apparent collapse and the volatile conditions in the stock market
it became apparent in hearings that there ought to be regulation of leveraged buy - outs of some sort <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman of the <unk> <unk> <unk> said during the panel deliberations
i do n't believe <unk> in the airline business you can be totally laissez - faire because of the high degree of public interest at stake
but <unk> <unk> disagreed calling the legislation a retreat from the policy of deregulaton of the airline industry
in his letter to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the secretary also said n the bill would be at odds with the administration policies welcoming open foreign investment and market allocation of resources
currently the <unk> <unk> does n't have the authority to block a takeover in advance
however if the secretary concludes that a transaction has made a carrier unfit to operate the department may revoke its certificate grounding the airline
such authority is more than adequate say <unk> opponents of the legislation
but supporters argue that grounding an airline is so drastic that the department would hesitate doing it
the panel rejected a proposal pushed by <unk> <unk> the parent of <unk> airlines to allow the transportation secretary to block corporate raiders from waging proxy fights to oust boards that oppose a leveraged buy - out
it also voted down proposals to give the secretary much more discretion on whether to block a buy - out and to require the department to consider the impact of a buy - out on workers
<unk> shares rallied to post strong gains after initial fears evaporated that the <unk> earthquake would depress <unk> <unk> prices
<unk> stocks which rebounded strongly <unk> extended their gains yesterday but most other asian and pacific markets closed sharply lower

the mood changed after dealers reappraised the direct impact of the disaster on shares and <unk> <unk> rebounded from early losses
the <unk> <unk> <unk> index settled <unk> points higher at n

<unk> composite or non - life insurers which some equity analysts said <unk> might be heavily hit by the earthquake disaster helped support the <unk> market by showing only narrow losses in early trading
the insurers relative resilience gave the market time <unk> to reappraise the impact of the <unk> disaster on <unk> equities dealers said n
dealers said n the market still has n't shaken off its nervousness after its bumpy ride of the past several sessions caused by interest - rate increases last week and <unk> <unk> <unk> plunge <unk>
but technical factors including modest gains in the value of the pound helped draw buying back into the market and reverse losses posted a day earlier
among composite insurers <unk> <unk> rose <unk> pence to <unk> <unk> a share <unk> <unk> climbed <unk> to <unk> pence <unk> <unk> rose <unk> to <unk> and <unk> <unk> jumped <unk> to n
life insurers fared similarly with <unk> <unk> advancing <unk> to <unk> although <unk> fell <unk> to <unk> <unk>

we think n there a good prospect that competition is going to get pretty fierce in this market said <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> vice president
we see it becoming a bargain - basement kind of business
the company estimated that the transaction would enhance its book value which stood at <unk> a share on <unk> n by more than n million or about <unk> a share
the company also said n the transaction would bolster after - tax earnings by <unk> a share when completed and boost its primary capital ratio to <unk> from <unk>

we in no way committed to a deal going through at all
we not rushing into anything
we do n't want to be party to a second rejection he said adding that coming up with a revised offer could easily take several weeks
<unk> <unk> remarks confirming a report in the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> wants to start from scratch in any new bid for the nation second - largest airline helped push <unk> stock lower for the fourth straight day

under the original buy - out approved by the <unk> board <unk> <unk> <unk> pilots planned to put up n million in cash and make n million in annual cost concessions for a <unk> stake
<unk> management was to pay n million for n and british <unk> was to receive a <unk> stake
the buy - out fell through when <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> unexpectedly failed to obtain bank financing
since then <unk> stock has fallen <unk> in what may rank as the largest collapse of a takeover stock ever
the tenor of <unk> <unk> remarks seemed to indicate that british <unk> will take a more active high - profile role in pursuing any new bid
he said <unk> he believes <unk> <unk> management was badly advised on the funding of its original transaction
<unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> has n't received any new buy - out proposals from the labor - management group led by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and has n't received any indication of when one might be forthcoming
as far as we concerned we waiting for the dust to settle he said
although british <unk> is waiting to see what the buy - out group comes up with <unk> <unk> said <unk> a revised transaction with less debt leverage is likely to be more attractive to banks
he said n the original proposal is dead and all aspects of a revised version are up for change in light of the changes in <unk> market price the amount of debt n banks are willing to fund and the price <unk> <unk> <unk> would be willing to pay
<unk> <unk> said <unk> he expects n the new price will be considerably lower but declined to specify a figure
asked whether a n figure circulating in the market yesterday is too low he said it certainly not too low
he added n the original offer was a pretty full price and that british <unk> contribution was quite a large chunk for us
british <unk> was originally attracted to the chance of obtaining a <unk> stake in the company but was n't particularly happy with paying n million
if the new deal had us putting up less money but still having n that would be a point in our favor he said
in any new proposal <unk> <unk> would expect a greater rate of return than the n in the original proposal
in the event that the buy - out group stalls in reviving its bid the <unk> board could remain under some pressure to seek another transaction even without any legal obligation to do so
roughly one - third of its stock is believed held by takeover stock traders who could vote to oust the board if they become impatient
meanwhile the buy - out group task of holding its fragile coalition together in the face of the bid collapse and internal opposition from two other employee groups has been further complicated by an apparent rift in the ranks of the pilot union itself
a pilot representing a group of <unk> pilots hired during <unk> <unk> strike filed suit <unk> in <unk> federal court to block the takeover
the dissident pilots oppose the plan because it would cause them to lose their seniority
<unk> management agreed to reduce the seniority of those pilots in exchange for the support of the <unk> pilot union for the buy - out proposal
the <unk> pilots involved in the suit are n't members of the union
the airline had allowed them to move ahead of some union members in seniority following the n strike a move n the union had contested in a previous lawsuit

corporate efforts to control health - care costs by requiring evaluations prior to planned hospitalization and surgery have n't been sweeping enough to reduce the long - term rate of cost increases according to a study by the <unk> of <unk>
in the last decade many corporations have embraced the utilization management cost containment strategy as a way n to control health - care costs for employees
these programs vary widely but often require second opinions on proposed surgery preadmission reviews of elective hospitalizations and reviews of treatment during illnesses or recovery periods
between <unk> and <unk> of today workers are covered by such plans up from <unk> five years ago
although it probably has reduced the level of expenditures for some purchasers utilization management like most other cost containment strategies does n't appear to have altered the long - term rate of increase in health - care costs the <unk> of <unk> an affiliate of the <unk> <unk> of sciences concluded after a two - year study
employers who saw a short - term moderation in benefit expenditures are seeing a return to previous trends
while utilization management frequently reduces hospitalization costs these savings are often offset by increases in outpatient services and higher administrative costs according to the report by a panel of health - care experts
the report suggested that current review programs are too narrow
the unnecessary and inappropriate use of the hospital and not the actual need for a particular procedure has been the main focus the panel said
as a general rule prior - review programs have not made case - by-case assessments of the comparative costs of alternative treatments or sites of care
the report said that utilization management should have more of an impact as federal research on the effectiveness of medical treatments helps lead to medical practice guidelines
<unk> <unk> a panel member and a vice president of <unk> <unk> <unk> said that utilization management will also do a better job of containing costs as it spreads to cover medical services delivered outside of hospitals
there pretty good evidence that utilization management has reduced inappropriate hospitalization he said
but at the same time spending on physician services and ambulatory care have mushroomed
it like squeezing a balloon <unk> <unk> said
<unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said that clients of his consulting firm report that utilization management reduces their hospital care bills by about n but he agreed that for the health - care system as whole some of these savings are offset by administrative and outpatient care costs
<unk> <unk> chairman of the panel agrees that administrative costs of utilization management programs can be high
you have a whole staff standing ready to evaluate the appropriateness of recommended treatment he said n
<unk> <unk> who also is president of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> hospitals in <unk> noted that the hospitals n he runs deal with more than n utilization management firms and that many of them have different procedures and requirements
the panel urged greater efforts to reduce the complexity paperwork and cost of utilization review
utilization management needs to better demonstrate that it reduces the wasteful use of resources improves the appropriateness of patient care and imposes only reasonable burdens on patients and providers the panel concluded

<unk> and <unk> are expected to invest a total of about three billion french francs n million in the venture including <unk> <unk> billion for design and development costs
in addition the companies will each spend about <unk> n billion on tooling up their plants
<unk> <unk> said <unk> the joint venture represents considerable savings for both <unk> and <unk> since both companies would in any case have had to renew their existing ranges of light goods vehicles
by pooling their resources the two groups have effectively halved the design and development costs that would otherwise have been entailed he said n
<unk> officials said <unk> the potential european market for light trucks in the <unk> to <unk> range is between <unk> and n vehicles annually and <unk> and <unk> are aiming for a combined market share of about <unk>
both <unk> and <unk> will have world - wide marketing rights for the new range of vans and light trucks

the <unk> <unk> family of the <unk> holds an additional n of <unk> capital
the <unk> <unk> <unk> is the standard object of suggestions for organizational and institutional changes for two reasons
first its position in the government is anomalous
it has an unusual kind of independence from elected officials and still has authority over one of the most powerful of government instruments the control of the money supply
thus we have a condition that is easily described as undemocratic
second the responsibilities of the <unk> <unk> as guardian of the currency which means as guardian of the stability of the price level sometimes lead it to take measures that are unpopular
as former <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> used to say they would have to take the punch bowl away just as the party is getting interesting
so the <unk> <unk> is an attractive target for complaint by politicians
the <unk> is easily assigned the blame for unpleasantness like high interest rates or slow economic growth while the politicians can escape responsibility by pointing to the <unk> independence
this leads to proposals for reform of the <unk> which have the common feature of making the <unk> more responsive to the administration to the <unk> and to public opinion without however any assumption of additional responsibility by the politicians
these proposals include changing the term of the chairman shortening the terms of the members eliminating the presidents of the <unk> <unk> banks from the decision - making process putting the <unk> of the <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> having the <unk> audited by an arm of <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> putting the <unk> expenditures in the budget and requiring prompt publication of the <unk> minutes
some of these ideas are again under consideration in <unk>
but these proposals do not rest on a view of what the <unk> problem is or if they do they rest on an incorrect view
they would not solve the problem they would make it worse
the problem is not that the <unk> is too unresponsive to the public interest
on the contrary it is too responsive to an incorrect view of the public interest
the price level in the <unk> is now about <unk> <unk> times as high as it was n years ago
on average something that cost <unk> n years ago now costs <unk>
or a wage that was <unk> n years ago would buy only <unk> worth of stuff today
on two occasions the inflation rate rose to more than <unk> a year
in each case the ending of this unsustainable inflation caused a severe recession the two worst of the postwar period
the enormous inflation over the past <unk> years was largely due to monetary policy
at least it would not have happened without the support of monetary policy that provided for a <unk> increase in the money supply during the same period
and that increase in the money supply would not have happened without the consent of the <unk> <unk>
the basic problem of monetary policy to which reform of the <unk> should be addressed is to prevent a recurrence of this experience
there were two general reasons for the mistaken monetary policy of the past <unk> years
n to some extent the <unk> <unk> shared the popular but incorrect view that expansionary monetary policy could yield a net improvement in employment and output
n even where the <unk> did not share this view it felt the need to accommodate to it
despite all the formal provisions for its independence the <unk> seems constantly to feel that if it uses its independence too freely it will lose it
the common proposals for reforming the <unk> would only make the situation worse if they had any effect at all
putting the <unk> of the <unk> on the <unk> of governors one of the leading proposals today is an example
the secretary is the world biggest borrower of money
he has a built - in constant longing for lower interest rates
moreover he is a political agent of a political president who naturally gives extraordinary weight to the way n the economy will perform before the next election and less to its longer - run health
these days the secretary suffers the further disqualification that he is a member of a club of seven finance ministers who meet occasionally to decide what exchange rates should be which is a diversion from the real business of the <unk> <unk> to stabilize the price level
how should a reasonable member of the <unk> <unk> <unk> interpret a congressional decision to put the secretary on the board
could he plausibly interpret it as encouragement for the <unk> to give primary emphasis to stabilizing the price level
or would he interpret it as instruction to give more weight to these other objectives that the secretary represents low interest rates short - run economic expansion and stabilization of exchange rates at internationally managed levels
the answer seems perfectly clear
true a succession of <unk> chairmen has given color to the notion that the <unk> of the <unk> belongs on the <unk>
by their constant readiness to advise all and sundry about federal budgetary matters the chairmen have encouraged the belief that fiscal policy and monetary policy are ingredients of a common stew in which case it is natural that the <unk> and the <unk> and probably also the <unk> should be jointly engaged in stirring the pot
the <unk> case for its own independence would be a little stronger if it were more solicitous of the independence of the rest of the government
the <unk> problem is not that it is too independent or too unpolitical
the <unk> is responsive to and can not help being responsive to the more overtly political part of the government
the <unk> exercises a power given to it by <unk> and the president
but <unk> and the president accept no responsibility for the exercise of the power n they have given the <unk>
critics of the present arrangement are correct to say that it is undemocratic
what is undemocratic is the unwillingness of the more political parts of the government to take the responsibility for deciding the basic question of monetary policy which is what priority should be given to stabilizing the price level
to leave this decision to an independent agency is not only undemocratic
it also prevents the conduct of a policy that has a long - term rationale because it leaves the <unk> guessing about what are the expectations of its masters the politicians who have never had to consider the long - term consequences of monetary policy
the greatest contribution <unk> <unk> could make at this time would be to declare that stabilizing the price level is the primary responsibility of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
legislation to this effect has been introduced in <unk> in this session by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
it is not the kind of thing that is likely to be enacted however
<unk> would be required to make a hard decision and <unk> would much prefer to leave the hard decision to the <unk> and retain its rights of complaint after the fact
people will say that the nation and the government have other objectives in addition to stabilizing the price level which is true
but that is not the same as saying that the <unk> <unk> has other objectives
the government has other agencies and instruments for pursuing these other objectives
but it has only the <unk> n to pursue price - level stability
and the <unk> has at most very limited ability to contribute to the achievement of other objectives by means other than by stabilizing the price level
the two objectives most commonly thought to be legitimate competitors for the attention of the <unk> are high employment and rapid real growth
but the main lesson of economic policy in the past <unk> years is that if the <unk> compromises with the price - stability objective in the pursuit of these other goals the result is not high employment and rapid growth but is inflation
a former chairman of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> advisers <unk> <unk> is an <unk> <unk> <unk> fellow
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> joined the list of banks boosting reserves for losses on loans to less - developed countries setting out a n million provision and posting a n million third - quarter net loss as a result
the per - share loss was <unk>
in the year earlier period the <unk> <unk> parent of <unk> <unk> <unk> had net income of n million or <unk> a share
excluding the provision <unk> earned n million up <unk> from a year ago
the bank medium - term and long - term loans to less - developed countries total n million of which n million are n't accruing interest the bank said <unk>
republic total of nonperforming assets was n million at <unk> <unk> with its reserve for loan losses now standing at n million
abortion - rights advocates won last week battles but the war over the nation most - contentious social question is about to pick up again on turf that favors those seeking to restrict abortions
strict new regulations seem certain to pass the state <unk> in <unk> next week with easy approval by the <unk> and by democratic <unk> <unk> <unk> expected shortly thereafter
legislation n to require the consent of parents before their daughters under the age of <unk> can have abortions will probably pass both houses of the <unk> legislature and set up a grinding battle to override the expected veto of democratic <unk> <unk> <unk>
the short - term shift in the political climate surrounding abortion reflects two factors that are likely to govern the debate in the next several months the reawakening of the abortion - rights movement as a potent force after years of lassitude and the ability of each side to counter the other advance in one arena with a victory of its own elsewhere
the action in <unk> for example will follow last week collapse of a special session of the <unk> legislature n to enact restrictions on abortions in that state and the vote here in <unk> by the <unk> to permit federally paid abortions for poor women who are victims of rape or incest
but <unk> <unk> is expected to veto the congressional legislation and that along with the easy approval of the <unk> measure is likely to mute the abortion - rights activists claims of momentum and underline the challenges faced by this resurgent movement
it great to feel good for once in n years says <unk> <unk> a consultant to abortion - rights advocates reflecting the relief of his compatriots after last week victories the first major events since the <unk> <unk> in its <unk> <unk> <unk> decision permitted the states to enact restrictions on abortions
but how many more times we going to feel good in the next <unk> is another question
indeed abortion - rights activists still face their greatest tests
the pro - choice movement has shown finally that it can mobilize says <unk> <unk> - <unk> a <unk> <unk> political scientist who specializes in how state legislators handle the abortion question
but it still has n't shown that it can win in a state like <unk> or <unk> where abortion has been clearly an electoral issue and where it been an emotional issue for a long time
the foes of abortion hold the strong whip hand in <unk> where abortion - rights activists are so much on the defensive that their strategy is less to fight the proposed legislation than it is to stress how the state legislature does n't reflect the viewpoints of the state citizens
as a result <unk> state <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> the legislature leading foe of abortion has been given all but free rein n to press a strict seven - point plan to restrict abortion and he hopes n to force the <unk> <unk> directly to reassess its <unk> <unk> v. <unk> decision that established the right of abortion in the first place
the <unk> legislation the state <unk> <unk> <unk> approved it in <unk> this week and the full <unk> <unk> is expected to take up the bill next <unk> includes a provision n to ban abortions after n weeks of pregnancy except to avert the death of the mother
<unk> <unk> calculates that the provision which attacks the trimester standards that <unk> established will make it necessary for the <unk> <unk> to review <unk> and perhaps to overturn it
but the <unk> measure also includes an informed consent provision that may become widely imitated by abortion foes who want to make women contemplating abortion as uncomfortable as possible with the procedure and with themselves
under this legislation a woman must be informed <unk> hours before the operation of the details of the procedure and its risks
regardless of whether one supports or opposes the right to an abortion <unk> <unk> argues it is virtually impossible for any rational human being to disagree with the concept that a woman has the right to have all of the appropriate materials and advice made available to her before she makes a decision which one way or the other might remain with her for the rest of her life
in <unk> where the state <unk> is expected to approve parental - consent legislation by the end of next week <unk> <unk> is the principal obstacle for anti - abortionists
<unk> <unk> a consultant to abortion - rights activists in the state takes comfort from the fact that the state <unk> abortion opponents have n't been able to muster the votes n to overturn a veto on abortion in n years
but proponents believe n they may be able to shake enough votes loose to override the veto if they are successful in portraying the legislation as a matter of parents rights
in <unk> lawmakers will vote before next spring on legislation requiring physicians to perform tests on fetuses at n weeks to determine their gestational age weight and lung maturity along with a provision requiring that if fetuses survive an abortion a second doctor must be on hand to help it survive
the legislation failed by one vote to clear the <unk> rules <unk> <unk> but anti - abortionists still may succeed in bringing the measure to the floor this fall
<unk> <unk> executive director of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> says <unk> she and her allies are cautiously optimistic n they can defeat it if it comes to a floor vote
abortion foes in <unk> meanwhile expect a parental - consent bill to be sent to the state assembly floor by early <unk> and are hopeful of prevailing in both houses by next <unk>
in <unk> abortion opponents want to pass parental - consent legislation along with a statewide ban on the use of public funds personnel and facilities for abortion and viability tests for fetuses n weeks and older
the anti - abortionists are urging <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to press the issues in a special session scheduled to run <unk> n to <unk> n
the prognosis is only fair says <unk> <unk> administrative director of the <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk>
next year is an election year and the legislators just do n't want to do anything about this now
this legislative activity comes as both sides are undertaking new mobilization efforts plunging into gubernatorial races in <unk> and <unk> <unk> and girding for next autumn state elections
at the same time abortion foes have developed a national legislative strategy deciding to move on what <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> director of state organizational development calls reasonable measures that an overwhelming mainstream majority of americans support
these include bans on the use of abortion for birth control and sex selection and the public funding of alternatives for abortion
those who are on the other side can hardly oppose alternative funding if they continue to insist on calling themselves pro - choice rather than pro - abortion says <unk> <unk> the group associate state legislative coordinator
over the weekend the <unk> <unk> rights <unk> <unk> singled out eight politicians including <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> targets and held a <unk> seminar designed to train its leaders in political techniques including how to put the anti - abortionists on the defensive in state legislatures
we now see pro - choice legislators going on the offensive for the first time says <unk> <unk> executive director of the group

final approval came on a simple voice vote in the <unk> and the swift passage contrasted with months of negotiations over the underlying bill which is laced with special - interest provisions for both members and the executive branch
an estimated n million was added for university and science grants including n million for <unk> <unk>
and <unk> lawmakers were a driving force behind n million for u.s.-mexico border facilities or more than double the administration request
more than n million is allocated for pensions and expenses for former presidents and the budget for the official residence of <unk> <unk> <unk> is more than doubled with n designated for improvements to the property
even the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> is remembered with an extra n million n to help offset pay costs that other government departments are being asked to absorb
within the <unk> nearly n billion is provided for processing tax returns a <unk> increase over fiscal n and double what the government was spending five years ago
investigation and taxpayer service accounts would grow to n billion and <unk> specifically added n million for stepped up criminal investigations of money laundering related to drug traffic
the large increase in <unk> <unk> air - interdiction funds is also intended to counter smuggling and the annual appropriations level has more than quadrupled in five years
the n million provided for fiscal <unk> anticipates the purchase of a <unk> <unk> surveillance aircraft and five <unk> <unk> ii jets
despite administration reservations the plan has had the quiet backing of customs officials as well as influential lawmakers from <unk> home state <unk>
among legislative provisions attached to the bill is a ban on any <unk> <unk> expenditure for enforcement of a <unk> tax provision intended to counter discrimination in employee - benefit plans
small - business interests have lobbied against the so - called section n tax rules
repeal is considered likely now but the <unk> <unk> bill has been used as a vehicle to raise the profile of the issue and block any action in the interim
less noticed is a bit of legislative legerdemain by <unk> republicans on behalf of <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> to retroactively move a <unk> hospital from one county to the next to justify higher <unk> reimbursements

a <unk> - <unk> conference reached agreement <unk> <unk> on virtually all major provisions of the bill but final settlement has been stalled because of differences between the two men over the fate of a modest <unk> - based program <unk> to provide technical information to farmers seeking to reduce their dependence on chemical fertilizers and pesticides
the program nonprofit sponsors received <unk> in fiscal n through an <unk> <unk> grant but <unk> <unk> has been adamant in insisting that the program be cut in <unk>
the <unk> <unk> takes a more orthodox entrenched view of agriculture policy than those in the movement to reduce chemical use but as a master of pork - barrel politics he is believed to be annoyed as well that the project moved to <unk> from a <unk> center near <unk> and the northern <unk> border

<unk> <unk> <unk> may delay aspects of its defensive restructuring plan including the sale of its <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> units in the wake of the current upheaval in financial markets company officials said n
the british conglomerate planning its own defensive restructuring to fight off a <unk> billion n billion takeover bid by <unk> - french financier <unk> <unk> <unk> intends to press ahead with an extraordinary shareholder vote today to clear the way for its value - boosting measures
if anything the gyrations in world stock markets and in <unk> share price since last <unk> sharp <unk> <unk> sell - off have increased the likelihood of shareholder approval for the restructuring analysts and several big institutional holders said n
thank <unk> <unk> we have some deal on the table said <unk> <unk> a director at <unk> <unk> <unk> managers which intends to vote its roughly <unk> stake in favor of the restructuring
investors in <unk> have been on a roller coaster
<unk> has been <unk> best - performing blue chip over the past six months up <unk> against a <unk> rise in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
but this week <unk> has been hit harder than other big <unk> stocks first by the market gyrations then by <unk> <unk> <unk> earthquake which could leave <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> insurance unit facing big claims
<unk> rose five pence eight cents to <unk> pence n in <unk> yesterday as a late market rally erased a n fall earlier in the day
to fight off predators <unk> plans to spin off about <unk> billion in assets largely by selling such <unk> retailing units as <unk> <unk> and <unk> and by floating its big paper and <unk> retailing business via share issues to existing holders
proceeds will help pay for a planned buy - back of <unk> of its shares and a <unk> dividend increase
i think n the restructuring will get the required support said <unk> <unk> an analyst at <unk> stockbroker <unk> <unk> <unk>
the shareholders effectively will support the share price by clearing the share buy - back
but <unk> restructuring which was never going to happen quickly now will take longer because of the market upheaval
company officials holders and analysts who previously expected the disposals to be substantially complete by the end of next year first half now say n the market gyrations could delay the actions well into the second half
we are n't forced sellers
we do n't have an absolute deadline and if market conditions are truly awful we might decide <unk> it is not the right time n to take particular steps said <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> spokesman
even if <unk> receives approval for the restructuring the company will remain in play say n shareholders and analysts though the situation may unfold over the next <unk> months rather than six
the new <unk> will be a smaller tobacco and financial - services hybrid whose price - earnings ratio may more closely reflect the lower - growth tobacco business than the higher - multiple financial - services business these holders believe n
thus <unk> restructuring may only make the company a more manageable target for other corporate predators possibly such acquisitive bidders as <unk> <unk>
the last few days will surely slow down the pace of events says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
but i would n't write off <unk> <unk> or other potential bidders
among possible delays the sales of <unk> and <unk> <unk> which were expected to be on the block soon after the crucial <unk> season may slide into the second quarter or second half
analysts estimate that sales of the two businesses could raise roughly n billion
<unk> is n't predicting a postponement because the units are quality businesses and we are encouraged by the breadth of inquiries said <unk> <unk> <unk>
but the delay could happen if <unk> does n't get adequate bids he said n
people familiar with <unk> say <unk> possible acquirers for the units include managers from both retailing chains and <unk> <unk> <unk> which is interested in bidding for <unk>
other potential bidders for parts of <unk> <unk> retail unit include <unk> <unk> stores <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> has declined to identify the potential bidders
though <unk> <unk> has said <unk> he intends to mount a new bid for <unk> once approval from <unk> insurance regulators is received jitters over prospects for junk - bond financing and <unk> leverage buy - outs are making investors more skeptical about <unk> <unk> prospects
his initial offer indicated <unk> he needed to raise as much as <unk> of the takeover financing through the debt markets
market uncertainty also clouds the outlook for <unk> attracting a premium price for its <unk> retailing properties

right now most of the roads into the <unk> area are closed but the list of closings changes about every n minutes
this <unk> morning the <unk> <unk> bridge was open and now we are informed that it is closed <unk> <unk> said

a <unk> spokesman said that although none of the company terminals trucks or airplanes were damaged in the quake road shutdowns and power failures have impeded its pickup and delivery of packages
the spokesman noted four - hour to five - hour traffic delays on the <unk> <unk> bridge for example
in addition power failures prevented its package - sorting facilities from operating causing delays
but freight railroads reported that damage to their facilities was relatively minor with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> rail unit the least affected by the quake
<unk> <unk> stopped freight trains <unk> night while its officials inspected track but resumed service at n p.m. when they found no damage
<unk> <unk> <unk> rail unit said that except for damage to shipping containers in its <unk> yard its track bridges and structures were unharmed
that railroad is operating trains but with delays caused by employees unable to get to work
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the hardest hit of the three railroads in the <unk> area said n service on its north - south coastline which is used by an <unk> train between <unk> <unk> and <unk> was suspended temporarily because of kinked rails near the epicenter of the quake
but service on the line is expected to resume by noon today
we had no serious damage on the railroad said a <unk> <unk> spokesman
we have no problem to our freight service at all expect for the fact <unk> businesses are shut down
<unk> said n it suspended train service into its <unk> station which sustained heavy structural damage during the quake
the passenger railroad said n it terminated some runs in <unk> relying on buses to ferry passengers to the <unk> area

the highway system is screwed up by the earthquake <unk> <unk> said <unk>
the transit system is how people are going to be getting around
he added that <unk> <unk> trolley cars and trolley buses were also running at full service levels
although air - traffic delays in <unk> <unk> were significant yesterday they did n't appear to spread to other airports
the earthquake shattered windows at <unk> <unk> <unk> air - traffic control tower and rained pieces of the ceiling down on controllers three of whom suffered minor injuries
terminals at <unk> <unk> <unk> also were damaged but the tower itself was intact
<unk> night thousands were diverted to other airports and had to wait a day to resume travel
runways at <unk> <unk> were n't damaged but traffic was being limited yesterday to n arrivals and n departures an hour down from <unk> to n an hour normally mainly because the noise level in the control tower was overwhelming without the windows an <unk> spokeswoman said n
while the airport was closed flights were diverted to airports in <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>

in terms of diversions <unk> <unk> <unk> may have experienced the most far - flung a <unk> flight from <unk> was rerouted there
i think n that the first nonstop commercial passenger flight from <unk> <unk> to land here an airport spokesman said
a <unk> <unk> <unk> spokesman said <unk> its flights into and out of <unk> <unk> were n't affected but getting information about its operations was difficult
its telecommunications headquarters in <unk> <unk> had been knocked out since the quake
we in the dark he said
<unk> <unk> put its spirits division up for sale triggering a scramble among global groups for the british company brands
<unk> already has been approached by about half a dozen companies interested in buying all or part of the spirits business a spokesman said n
analysts expect the spirits operations and some <unk> vineyards that also are being sold to fetch about n million n million
among the brands for sale are <unk> gin the no . n imported gin in the <unk> and <unk> single - malt whiskey
also for sale are <unk> <unk> <unk> which distributes <unk> <unk> blended whiskey in the <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> vineyards in <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> alone is worth as much as n million analysts said n
<unk> bought the <unk> distillery two years ago for n million
that purchase represented an attempt by <unk> a venerable british brewer to become a major player in the global liquor business
but <unk> has been squeezed by giant rivals amid widespread consolidation in the industry
now it wants to concentrate on beer and its newer hotel and restaurant operations
for rival liquor companies the <unk> auction is a rare opportunity to acquire valuable brands
it not very often <unk> something like this comes up said <unk> <unk> a liquor company analyst at <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>
the division will be sold off quite rapidly predicted <unk> <unk> an analyst at <unk> brokers <unk> <unk> <unk>
among possible buyers <unk> <unk> <unk> might find <unk> a useful addition to its portfolio
<unk> <unk> owns <unk> gin the no . n imported gin in the <unk> rival <unk> <unk> has the no . n imported brand <unk>
the <unk> spirits auction is an extremely interesting development and naturally we be considering it carefully a <unk> <unk> spokesman said n
<unk> which owns several leading whiskey brands plus <unk> gin the world no . n gin is considered less likely to bid for the <unk> spirits
a <unk> spokesman declined to comment
two other global liquor giants <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> - <unk> <unk> also are possible buyers
<unk> gin is the world no . n gin brand but the company does n't own any of the major gin brands imported in the <unk>

we will certainly have to take a look at the <unk> spirits business an <unk> - <unk> spokesman said n
we would certainly like to have a major white - spirits brand in our portfolio
a <unk> spokesman in <unk> <unk> would n't comment
smaller liquor companies such as <unk> - <unk> <unk> and <unk> brands <unk> of the <unk> also are likely to be interested
such companies are increasingly being left behind in the global liquor business says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>

<unk> had total pretax profit in the year ended <unk> <unk> of n million on sales of n billion
<unk> spirits auction occurs amid a parallel shakeup in the british beer industry
earlier this year the government announced plans to foster increased competition in the industry
british brewers currently own thousands of pubs which in turn sell only the breweries beer and soft drinks
under new rules many of the country pubs would become free houses selling beers of their choice
<unk> now intends to bolster its brewing interests in an effort to grab a share of sales to free houses
the company which last month paid n million for regional british brewer <unk> <unk> <unk> has about <unk> of the british beer market
<unk> also owns the license to brew and distribute <unk> and <unk> <unk> beers in <unk>
in addition <unk> intends to focus on its newer hotel liquor store and restaurant businesses in <unk> and <unk> <unk>
in <unk> those interests include the <unk> steakhouse chain and joint ownership with <unk> <unk> of the country <unk> <unk> chain
in <unk> and the <unk> <unk> owns the <unk> chain of steak and seafood restaurants
focusing on beer restaurants and hotels means n we can concentrate our skills and resources more effectively <unk> <unk> <unk> managing director said <unk> in a statement
the spirits business would require substantial additional investment to enable it to compete effectively in the first division of global players
<unk> also announced that <unk> <unk> who is <unk> will become the company chief executive <unk> n

but an uninvited guest is expected to try to crash the party
on the morning of the long - planned announcement <unk> <unk> machines <unk> is to introduce its own new mainframe
their attitude is you want to talk mainframes we talk mainframes says one computer industry executive
they deliberately trying to steal our thunder a <unk> executive complains
maybe we should take it as a compliment
digital target is the n billion market for mainframe computers the closet - sized number - crunchers that nearly every big company needs to run its business
<unk> based in <unk> <unk> has dominated the market for decades
that does n't scare <unk> which has grown to be the world second - largest computer maker by poaching customers of <unk> mid - range machines
<unk> based in <unk> <unk> hopes to stage a repeat performance in mainframes and it has spent almost n billion developing the new technology
a spoiler nimble <unk> computers <unk> in <unk> <unk> jumped into the fray earlier this week with an aggressively priced entry

the surge in competition is expected to stir new life into the huge mainframe market where growth has slowed to single digits in recent years
<unk> traditional mainframe rivals including <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> have struggled recently

and unlike <unk> water - cooled mainframes it does n't need any plumbing
the challengers will have a big price advantage
<unk> is expected to tag its new line from about n million to n million and up depending on configuration
that about half the price of comparably equipped <unk> mainframes
<unk> pricing is just as aggressive
the heightened competition will hit <unk> at a difficult time
the computer giant current mainframe line which has sold well and has huge profit margins is starting to show its age
the new <unk> due next week will boost performance by only about <unk> to n

still no one expects <unk> rivals to deliver a knockout
<unk> has a near - monopoly on mainframes with an estimated n share of the market
<unk> is five times the size of <unk> and <unk> times the size of <unk> and wields enormous market power
it counts among its customers a majority of the world largest corporations which entrust their most critical business information to <unk> computers
we not going to walk in and replace a company corporate accounting system if it already running on an <unk> mainframe concedes <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> president
he says <unk> <unk> will target faster - growing market segments such as on - line transaction processing which includes retail - sales tracking airline reservations and bank - teller networks
<unk> which already specializes in on - line transaction processing is a potent competitor in that market
a key marketing target for <unk> will be the large number of big customers who already own both <unk> and <unk> systems
one such company is bankers <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> a vice president technological and strategic planning at bankers <unk> says that despite <unk> low prices we are n't about to unplug our <unk> mainframes for a <unk> machine

the government said <unk> <unk> of americans or n million people were living in poverty in <unk>
while last year figure was down from <unk> in <unk> and marked the fifth consecutive annual decline in the poverty rate the <unk> <unk> said <unk> the <unk> drop was n't statistically significant
the bureau report also showed that while some measures of the nation economic well - being improved modestly in <unk> the fruits of prosperity were shared less equitably than the year before
summarizing data derived from a <unk> <unk> survey of <unk> households <unk> <unk> associate director of the <unk> <unk> said that most groups either stayed the same or improved
but he added n since the late <unk> the distribution of income has been slowly getting less equal
there was no reversal of that trend between <unk> and <unk>
per capita income a widely used measure of a nation economic health hit a record in <unk> rising n after inflation adjustment to <unk>
but the median income of american families fell n the first time n it has failed to rise since <unk>
<unk> <unk> said <unk> the divergence in the two measures reflects changes in family size and structure including the rising number of female - headed families and a sharp increase in income reported by americans who are n't living in families
as a result of last year decline the government estimate for the number of people living below the poverty line declined by about <unk>
the poverty threshold defined as three times food expenses as calculated by the <unk> <unk> last year was <unk> for a family of four
the <unk> <unk> counts all cash income in determining whether families are below the line but it does n't consider other government benefits such as <unk>
thanks largely to the continued growth of the <unk> economy the poverty rate is now substantially lower than the <unk> peak of <unk> but the improvements have been modest in the past couple of years
poverty remains far more widespread among blacks than other americans
in <unk> <unk> of blacks lived in poverty compared with n for whites and n for hispanics
but two - thirds of all poor americans were white

more than three - fourths of poor black families were headed by women
the poverty rate of children under n years old dropped last year to <unk> from <unk> in <unk> but remained far higher than a decade ago
the rate among the elderly <unk> in <unk> was n't significantly lower than the year before
if it were n't for <unk> <unk> payments more than three times as many elderly would be below the poverty line <unk> <unk> said <unk>
the <unk> <unk> also said
some n of all money income received by families in <unk> went to the wealthiest n of all families up from <unk> in <unk>
that is the greatest share reported for any year since <unk> although changing definitions over the years distort the comparison
the top fifth of all families got n of the income up from <unk> a decade earlier
the bottom fifth of all families got n of the income down from <unk> a decade earlier
confirming other government data showing that wages are n't keeping pace with inflation earnings of year - round full - time male workers fell <unk> in <unk> after adjusting for higher prices the first such drop since <unk>
earnings of female workers were unchanged
women working full - time earned n cents for every dollar earned by men a penny more than in <unk> and seven cents more than in <unk>
median household income which includes both those living in families and those who are n't rose <unk> last year to <unk> after inflation
it rose sharply in the <unk> and <unk> and fell slightly in the <unk> and <unk>
median family income was <unk> down <unk>
per capita income of blacks though still only <unk> that of whites rose n in n while per capita income of whites rose only n
among married couples the gap between blacks and whites narrowed sharply as income of black families shot up n while income of whites did n't budge
fueling a controversy that has been simmering for years the <unk> <unk> also said <unk> its figures would look far rosier if it recalculated the poverty threshold using an improved consumer - price measure adopted in <unk>
the bureau said <unk> some n million fewer people would have fallen below the poverty line in <unk> and the poverty rate would have been n instead of <unk> under the alternative calculation
critics on the left and right have been calling for all sorts of revisions to the measure for years

the sense grows that modern public bureaucracies simply do n't perform their assigned functions well
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> developer <unk> <unk> have agreed in principle to a n million settlement of shareholder litigation stemming from <unk> alleged greenmail payment to <unk> <unk>
according to lawyers familiar with the settlement talks the verbal agreement to end a lawsuit filed more than two years ago was reached last week and will soon be submitted to a federal judge in <unk> <unk>
in <unk> <unk> <unk> thwarted a possible hostile takeover bid from <unk> <unk> by agreeing to buy <unk> million of <unk> <unk> n million <unk> shares for n million more than n million above market price
the term greenmail refers to a situation where a company pays a premium over market value to repurchase a stake held by a potential acquirer
lawyers for shareholders <unk> and <unk> <unk> all declined to talk publicly about the proposed settlement citing a request by a federal court magistrate not to reveal details of the agreement until it is completed
but some attorneys who are familiar with the matter said <unk> the n million payment will be shared by <unk> and <unk> <unk> with the casino and hotel concern probably paying the bulk of the money
the amount <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> will pay to settle the class - action suit pales in comparison to the <unk> million <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> agreed to pay to settle a similar suit in <unk>
that settlement represented the first time <unk> shareholders were granted a major payment in a greenmail case
<unk> <unk> made a n million profit on the sale to <unk> of his investment in the company in <unk>
but lawyers said <unk> <unk> <unk> probably faced much more potential liability because when he sued <unk> during his takeover battle he filed on behalf of all shareholders
when <unk> offered to pay <unk> <unk> a premium for his shares the <unk> <unk> investor did n't demand <unk> the company also pay a premium to other shareholders
when <unk> <unk> sued <unk> he sued only on behalf of himself
<unk> <unk> and <unk> also appeared to have some leverage in the case because in the state of <unk> where <unk> is incorporated courts have held that greenmail is often protected by the business - judgment rule
that rule gives boards of directors wide latitude in deciding how to deal with dissident shareholders

yesterday <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> faced his jury the full <unk> <unk> and said i am not guilty of having committed any crime
seventeen articles of impeachment against the <unk> judge one of the few blacks on the <unk> bench were approved by the <unk> in <unk> <unk>
the central charge against <unk> <unk> is that he conspired with a <unk> lawyer to obtain a <unk> bribe from defendants in a criminal case before the judge in return for leniency
he is also accused of lying under oath and of leaking information obtained from a wiretap n he supervised
the <unk> public gallery was packed with <unk> <unk> supporters who erupted into applause after he finished his argument

the <unk> will deliberate behind closed doors today and is scheduled to vote on the impeachment tomorrow

companies seeking to make insurers pay for pollution cleanup win court victory
in a case involving <unk> industries <unk> and its insurer <unk> <unk> . the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of appeals in <unk> <unk> ruled in favor of the company on two issues that lawyers say n are central to dozens of pollution cases around the country
travelers and other insurers have maintained that cleanup costs are n't damages and thus are n't covered under commercial policies
they also have argued that government proceedings notifying a company of potential responsibility do n't fit the legal definition of a lawsuit thus such governmental proceedings are n't covered by the policies the insurers say n
the appeals court disagreed on both counts
<unk> was notified by <unk> officials in n that it was potentially responsible for a cleanup at an oil - recycling plant
<unk> asked travelers to defend it in the state proceeding but the insurer did n't respond
the appeals court upheld a district judge ruling that the insurer had to defend the company in such proceedings
the appeals court also said n we think n an ordinary businessman reading this policy would have believed himself covered for the demands and potential damage claims stemming from any cleanup
this decision will have a very considerable impact said <unk> <unk> <unk> professor of environmental law and insurance law at the <unk> of <unk> because many commercial insurance policies are issued by companies based in <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> an attorney for the <unk> manufacturers <unk> said that while other appeals courts have ruled differently on whether cleanup costs are damages the influence of the appeals court in <unk> <unk> will make insurers sit up and listen
he said <unk> the decision was the first in which a federal appeals court has ruled whether administrative government proceedings qualify as litigation
<unk> <unk> <unk> an attorney for <unk> said there are procedural bases on which this case will be appealed further
new <unk> poor face nearly three million legal problems a year without legal help
that is the conclusion of a report released by the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the report was based on a telephone survey of <unk> low - income households across the state a mail survey of major legal - services programs and on - site interviews with individuals in the field
the report provides detailed documentation of the extent and nature of the problem and indicates how we may want to shape solutions said <unk> <unk> chairman of the committee that oversaw the survey and a partner at the law firm of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
according to the study slightly more than <unk> of those surveyed reported having at least one housing problem every year for which they had no legal help

other areas targeted by the survey respondents included difficulty obtaining or maintaining public benefits n consumer fraud <unk> and health - care issues n
during the <unk> survey <unk> of all legal - services programs said that at some period they were unable to accept new clients unless they had an emergency

after failing to find a buyer for the <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is negotiating with <unk> pension fund adviser <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to refinance the property for close to n million according to people close to the negotiations
under the proposed agreement involving the world tallest building <unk> - based <unk> would receive about half the money through conventional mortgage financing and the other half as a convertible mortgage
at the end of the term of the convertible loan <unk> could still own half the building and <unk> could own the other half
neither side would comment
the parties are currently negotiating over who would manage the building which will be emptied of <unk> employees from <unk> merchandise group which is moving elsewhere
the new manager will face the daunting task of leasing n million square feet in a relatively soft <unk> real estate market
also it has not yet been decided exactly how much of the mortgage <unk> will be able to convert into equity
convertible mortgages have become an increasingly popular way n to finance prestigious buildings of late
in a convertible mortgage the investor lends the building owner a certain amount in return for the option to convert its interest into equity usually less than n at the end of the loan term
during the term the lender can either receive a percentage of cash flow a percentage of the building appreciation or a fixed return
the main advantage of a convertible mortgage is that it is not a sale and therefore does not trigger costly transfer taxes and reappraisal
<unk> said n it would put the n tower on the block almost a year ago as part of its anti - takeover restructuring
but japanese institutions shied away from bidding on the high - profile tower out of fear n their purchase of the property would trigger anti - japanese sentiment
last summer <unk> appeared to have a deal with canadian developer <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
but that deal fell through in <unk> after it became clear that the sale would lead to a major real estate tax reassessment raising property taxes and making it difficult to lease the building at competitive prices
real estate industry executives said <unk> <unk> investment banker <unk> <unk> <unk> sought financing in <unk>
however japanese authorities apparently were concerned that a refinancing also would attract too much publicity
<unk> then went back to <unk> the <unk> pension adviser that had proposed a convertible debt deal during the first round of bids last spring
<unk> has n billion of real estate investments nationwide according to a spokesman
<unk> <unk> said n it signed a definitive agreement to acquire two units of <unk> <unk> of <unk> for cash
the amount was n't disclosed
the electronics maker and retailer previously estimated the sale price at between n million and n million for <unk> <unk> microcomputer and <unk> hand - held computer subsidiaries
in addition <unk> will acquire rights to the <unk> and <unk> names for computers
during <unk> the <unk> subsidiaries had combined sales in excess of n million
the transaction will give <unk> a well - known european computer brand that includes n dealers and distributors marketing to medium - sized business and educational institutions
closing of the transaction is subject to certain conditions and regulatory approvals the company said n
two rules in pending congressional legislation threaten to hinder leveraged buy - outs by raising the price tags of such deals by as much as <unk>
<unk> <unk> is seething over the rules which would curtail the tax deductibility of debt used in most lbos
the provisions in deficit - reduction bills recently passed by the <unk> and <unk> could further cool the takeover boom that has been the driving force behind the bull market in stocks for much of the <unk> some tax experts and investment bankers argue n
indeed some investment bankers have already started restructuring deals to cope with the expected rules
<unk> <unk> has all but conceded on the issue and is now lobbying for the less onerous <unk> version of one of the provisions
at issue is the deductibility of certain junk bonds that are used in most lbos
such high - yield debt is similar to a zero - coupon bond in that it is sold at a discount to face value with interest accruing instead of being paid to the holder
under current rules that accrued interest is deductible by the company issuing the debt
the <unk> version of the legislation would kill that deduction and label any such debt as equity which is n't deductible
the less - rigorous <unk> version would defer the deductibility for roughly five years
you see these in just about every <unk> said <unk> <unk> senior vice president in charge of tax issues at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
it becomes a source of cash for the company making the lbo because it gets a deduction and does n't have to repay the debt for several years
typically <unk> <unk> estimates n this type of debt makes up <unk> to n of the financing for lbos
these types of bonds have been used in buy - outs of companies such as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> communications <unk> and <unk> <unk>
a second provision passed by the <unk> and <unk> would eliminate a rule allowing companies that post losses resulting from lbo debt to receive refunds of taxes paid over the previous three years
for example if a company posted a loss of n million from buy - out interest payments the existing rule would allow the concern to be able to receive a refund from the tax n it paid from <unk> through n when it may have been a profitable public company
but that rule is being virtually overlooked by <unk> <unk> which is concentrating on coping with the deduction issue
prices for lbos have to come down if you do n't have that feature argued <unk> <unk> managing director for merchant banking at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
several <unk> <unk> officials say n the proposed legislation already is having an impact
an investment group led by <unk> <unk> family recently lowered a <unk> billion bid for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> hills <unk> because of the threat of the legislation
moreover one investment banker who requested anonymity said <unk> his firm did n't raise the ante for a target company earlier this month after a stronger bid emerged from a public company that was n't concerned about the financing provision
we would have paid more if we thought <unk> that law was n't going to pass he said
one possible solution for <unk> <unk> is to increase the equity part of the transaction that is give lenders a bigger stake in the surviving company rather than just interest payments
that would force the buy - out firm and the target company management to reduce their level of ownership
the pigs in the trough may have to give a little bit of the slop back and then the deal can go through said <unk> <unk> <unk> tax partner at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
another solution said <unk> a tax lawyer who requested anonymity is for firms to use convertible bonds that sell at a discount
since they have a lower interest rate they would n't fall under the junk - bond category that would lose its deductibility
the <unk> version of the bill would make debt non - deductible if it pays five percentage points above <unk> notes has at least a five - year maturity and does n't pay interest for at least one year out of the first five
the bill would then declare that the debt is equity and therefore is n't deductible
the <unk> bill would only deny the deduction until interest is actually paid
currently even though the issuer does n't pay tax the debt holder is taxed on the accrued interest
but those holders are often foreign investors and tax - exempt pension funds that do n't pay taxes on their holdings
the <unk> estimates that its version of the provision would yield n million the first year and a total of n million over five years
the <unk> version would raise slightly more
even if <unk> <unk> finds ways around the new rules a <unk> aide contends <unk> lbos will become somewhat more difficult
there no question n it will make lbos more expensive he said
the interest deduction was the engine that made these things more productive
the average publicly offered commodity fund fell n in <unk> largely because of the volatile markets in foreign currencies according to <unk> securities
the firm said that losers outnumbered gainers by more than three to one among the <unk> funds n it tracks
for the first nine months of the year <unk> said <unk> the average fund has lost n
the government moved aggressively to open the spigots of federal aid for victims of the <unk> earthquake but its reservoir of emergency funds must be replenished soon if the aid is to continue
<unk> <unk> signed a disaster declaration covering seven northern <unk> counties
the declaration immediately made the counties eligible for temporary housing grants and low - cost loans n to cover uninsured property losses
in addition an unusually wide array of federal agencies moved to provide specialized assistance
the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> prepared to make as many as <unk> vacant houses available for those left homeless the <unk> <unk> was set to divert food from the school - lunch program to earthquake victims and the <unk> was providing everything from radio communications to blood transfusions to military police for directing traffic
but the pool of federal emergency - relief funds already is running low because of the heavy costs of cleaning up <unk> <unk> and <unk> will be under pressure to allocate more money quickly
in <unk> wake <unk> allocated n billion in relief funds and <unk> <unk> spokesman <unk> <unk> said <unk> n million of that money remains and could be diverted for quick expenditures related to the earthquake
now though enormous costs for earthquake relief will pile on top of outstanding costs for hurricane relief
that obviously means that we wo n't have enough for all of the emergencies that are now facing us and we will have to consider appropriate requests for follow - on funding <unk> <unk> said
the federal government is n't even attempting yet to estimate how much the earthquake will cost it
but <unk> <unk> said there will be i think quite obviously n a very large amount of money required from all levels of government
in <unk> lawmakers already are looking for ways <unk> to add relief funds
money could be added to a pending spending bill covering the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which coordinates federal disaster relief
more likely relief funds could be added to an omnibus spending bill that <unk> is to begin considering next week
but it is n't just <unk> relief dollars that are spread thin its relief manpower also is stretched
<unk> still has special disaster centers open n to handle the aftermath of <unk> and spokesman <unk> <unk> acknowledged that we pretty thin
<unk> <unk> says <unk> <unk> now possibly may have the heaviest caseload in its history
to further complicate relief efforts the privately funded <unk> <unk> <unk> also finds itself strapped for funds after its big <unk> operation
it been a bad month money - wise and every other way said <unk> <unk> a spokeswoman for the <unk> <unk>
it just makes it a little rough when you have to worry about the budget
the <unk> <unk> has opened <unk> shelters in the <unk> area serving n people
twenty - five trucks capable of cooking food were dispatched from other states
all the precise types of federal aid that will be sent to <unk> wo n't be determined until state officials make specific requests to <unk> agency officials said n
and in the confusion after the earthquake the information flow is a little slow coming in from the affected area said <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> spokesman
still some aid is moving westward from <unk> almost immediately
<unk> officials said n they will make available as many as <unk> <unk> area houses that are under <unk> loans but now are vacant after the houses have been inspected to ensure n they are sound
additional housing vouchers and certificates will be made available officials said <unk> and some housing and community - development funds may be shifted from other programs or made available for emergency use
another federal agency not normally associated with disaster relief the <unk> <unk> <unk> moved quickly as well
the <unk> said n it will waive certain tax penalties for earthquake victims unable to meet return deadlines or make payments because of the quake devastation
the agency plans to announce specific relief procedures in the coming days
and the <unk> said <unk> residents of the <unk> <unk> area will be able to cash in savings bonds even if they have n't held them for the minimum six - month period
one advantage that federal officials have in handling earthquake relief is the large number of military facilities in the <unk> <unk> <unk> area facilities that provide a ready base of supplies and workers
even before the full extent of the devastation was known <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ordered the military services to set up an emergency command center in the <unk> and prepare to respond to various <unk> requests for assistance
by yesterday afternoon <unk> <unk> transport planes began moving additional rescue and medical supplies physicians communications equipment and <unk> personnel to <unk>
a military jet flew a congressional delegation and senior <unk> administration officials to survey the damage
and the <unk> said <unk> dozens of additional crews and transport aircraft were on alert awaiting orders to move emergency supplies
two <unk> <unk> facilities near <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> miles northeast of <unk> <unk> were designated to serve as medical - airlift centers
some victims also were treated at the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> and at the <unk> <unk> in <unk>
in addition n military police from the <unk> a military base in <unk> <unk> are assisting with traffic control and a <unk> ship was moved from a naval station at <unk> <unk> near the <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to help fight fires
to help residents in northern <unk> rebuild <unk> intends to set up n disaster assistance offices in the earthquake area in the next several days and to staff them with <unk> to n workers from various agencies said <unk> <unk> <unk> chief of the agency individual assistance division
at these offices earthquake victims will be helped in filling out a one - page form that they will need to qualify for such federal assistance as home - improvement loans and to repair houses
and federal officials are promising to move rapidly with federal highway aid to rebuild the area severely damaged road system
the <unk> <unk> <unk> has an emergency relief program n to help states and local governments repair federally funded highways and bridges seriously damaged by natural disasters
the account currently has n million
and though federal law dictates that only n million can be disbursed from that fund in any one state per disaster administration officials expect <unk> to move in to authorize spending more now in <unk>
to get that money states must go through an elaborate approval process but officials expect red tape to be cut this time
<unk> <unk> special assistant to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> also said that after the n <unk> <unk> earthquake in <unk> <unk> the state set tougher standards for bridges and with federal aid began a program n to retrofit highways and bridges for earthquake hazards
the first phase of the program has been completed but two other phases are continuing
the two major structures that failed <unk> night he said n were both built well before the <unk> earthquake the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> completed in the <unk> and the section of <unk> built in the n
the <unk> section had completed the first phase of the retrofitting

still many were confident that in a day or two everything should be back to normal according to a spokeswoman for the <unk> <unk> <unk> based in <unk>
<unk> for instance said <unk> it anticipates returning to a normal work schedule by the weekend at its <unk> <unk> plant which puts out disk drives for the <unk> family of mainframes

<unk> <unk> <unk> with major facilities in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> said that all of its engineering and manufacturing sites had reported to corporate headquarters in <unk> <unk> <unk> night
none sustained significant damage a spokesman said n adding that the delicate manufacturing process machines were checked and were all found to be operating normally
for many companies of course there is still a slew of nagging problems n to grapple with some of which have the potential to become quite serious
for example a spokesman for <unk> <unk> <unk> said n the <unk> chip maker is worried about blackouts
a sudden surge or drop in electric power could ruin integrated circuits being built
but given what might have happened to the fragile parts that are at the heart of the microelectronics business the bulk of <unk> companies seemed to be just about shouting hosannas
several factors apparently spared the <unk> a sprawling suburban stretch from <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> from the kind of impact felt in <unk> <unk> an hour drive north
for one thing buildings there tend to be newer and thus in step with the latest safety codes
also the soil in the <unk> is solid unlike the landfill of <unk> <unk> downtown <unk> <unk> which was hit with fires and vast destruction
in addition some microelectronics companies said n they were prepared for tremulous conditions like <unk>
their machine tools are even bolted to the shop floor
<unk> said that over the past decade it has installed computer sensors and shutoff valves sensitive to the shake of an earthquake in the pipes that snake through its plants
like other large <unk> companies <unk> also noted that it has factories in several parts of the nation so that a breakdown at one location should n't leave customers in a total pinch
that certainly good news for such companies as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which has only a four - day supply of microprocessors from the <unk> on hand because of a just - in-time manufacturing approach that limits the buildup of inventory
<unk> said <unk> it foresees no difficulties in obtaining parts in the immediate future

<unk> <unk> <unk> contribued to this article
<unk> <unk> offered the world a faster way n to break eggs
as thanks the egg industry tried to break him
and the egg producers have done a pretty good job
they tried to put <unk> <unk> out of business by an act of <unk>
<unk> - industry lobbying helped persuade six states to ban <unk> <unk> automatic egg - breaking machine because of fears over salmonella
his company <unk> <unk> <unk> was forced to seek protection from creditors under federal bankruptcy law in <unk> and has since been liquidated
monthly sales of his <unk> <unk> machine which he now is marketing through a new company have sunk to about half a dozen from a peak of <unk> says n the n businessman
<unk> <unk> is n't the first entrepreneur n to bump up against entrenched interests
but his case is notable both for the scale of the fight it is n't often that a congressional hearing is held to determine whether one small businessman is a threat to the republic and for what it tells about the pitfalls of marketing a new product
now one might ask why people who sell eggs would fight someone who is trying to make it easier to crack them
part of the answer lies in the nature of the industry
many larger egg producers are also egg processors who crack inspect and sanitize billions of eggs turning them into powdered liquified or frozen egg products
however dozens of bakers restaurant chefs and other food preparers who flocked to <unk> <unk> defense say that products ranging from egg bread to eclairs lose some zip when the eggs come in <unk> cans instead of shells
but for companies that use hundreds of eggs a day breaking them by hand can get well out of hand
the idea behind the <unk> <unk> is pretty simple put the eggs into a cylinder that contains perforated baskets spin them at a high speed to break the shells and strain the edible part through the baskets
one <unk> <unk> which at just under four feet tall and two feet wide has been likened to the robot n can crack about <unk> eggs an hour
because fresh eggs are less expensive than processed ones a big egg user can recover the <unk> <unk> <unk> cost in a few months says <unk> <unk> <unk>
such centrifugal egg breakers have been around since the <unk>
but when <unk> <unk> came forward with his machine in the early n nobody else was offering them in the <unk>
the main reason salmonella
chickens carry this bacteria which can cause upset stomachs and in rare cases death among people
hens sometimes pass salmonella to the eggs and it can also be found on unclean shells
thus any machine that breaks large amounts of eggs at once has the potential to spread salmonella if a bad egg gets in with the good ones
<unk> <unk> claims n this is a manageable problem
the <unk> <unk> carries written instructions to break only high - grade eggs that have been properly sanitized and as an added precaution to use the eggs only in products that will be cooked enough to kill bacteria
with nearly n machines in use there have been no salmonella problems as long as instructions were followed <unk> <unk> boasts <unk>
he says <unk> the handful of salmonella cases involving products that may have used eggs broken by an <unk> <unk> stemmed from a failure to adequately cook the products
but he says n that no more a reason for banning <unk> kings than bad drivers are a reason for banning cars
opponents do n't buy such arguments
human nature being what it is people do n't always follow instructions says <unk> <unk> chief of food protection for the <unk> <unk> state <unk> <unk>
leading the assault against the <unk> <unk> has been <unk> <unk> producers
the <unk> <unk> trade group has issued a briefing book that claims n the machine is a health hazard and that <unk> <unk> is trying to make a fast buck at the expense of the nation egg producers
the <unk> declines to comment but the group attorney <unk> <unk> says <unk> the group actions are motivated solely by health concerns
an early battleground was the <unk> <unk> of <unk>
<unk> <unk> initially won approval for his machine to be used at egg - processing facilities regulated by the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
unfortunately for <unk> <unk> another branch of the <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> was in charge of eggs
after receiving complaints from egg producers this branch got the other branch to rescind its approval thus limiting the machine potential market to bakeries and restaurants and other establishments that are n't regulated by the <unk>
the egg producers also lobbied the <unk> and <unk> <unk>
but the <unk> in a <unk> letter to the <unk> <unk> producers said that there was little likelihood of a health problem as long as instructions were followed
so the producers went to <unk> <unk> where a congressman from <unk> introduced a measure to ban centrifugal egg - breaking machines
<unk> <unk> whose company at the time was based in <unk> <unk> <unk> enlisted his local congressman and the battle was joined
<unk> <unk> forces finally defeated the measure though it took a vote on the floor of the <unk> of representatives to do it
even then opponents managed to get a congressional hearing to examine what one congressman called an unscrupulous method for breaking eggs
foiled in their effort to get a national ban the egg producers turned their attention to the states
so far <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> have outlawed <unk> <unk> device citing health concerns
an antitrust suit that <unk> <unk> company filed in <unk> <unk> federal court against the <unk> <unk> producers and others only added to the entrepreneur woes
the judge dismissed the suit and ordered <unk> <unk> company to pay over n in legal fees to the defendants lawyers
<unk> <unk> says <unk> the ruling pushed his company into bankruptcy court
now he has moved to <unk> where costs are lower and started a new company <unk> <unk> n to market his machine
but so far the change of scenery has n't ended his string of bad breaks
<unk> <unk> recently fell from a horse and fractured his arm
<unk> <unk> ca n't chew gum and sing at the same time
but on the evidence of the <unk> <unk> boys that may be the only thing n she ca n't do at least when she acting in movies
as the tough slinky lounge chanteuse in the <unk> <unk> boys <unk> <unk> sings for herself and more than passably well
her <unk> <unk> handles a song the way n the greats do like she hearing the way n it should sound inside her head and she concentrating on matching that internal tone
yet her intensity stops and starts with the music
when she is n't performing for an audience she prepares for a song by removing the wad of gum from her mouth and indicates that she finished by sticking the gum back in
like almost everything in this wonderfully romantic and edgy movie <unk> <unk> <unk> seems like someone n you seen before in numerous show - biz stories even her name <unk> <unk> sounds like a character <unk> <unk> <unk> must have played
yet nothing about <unk> boys and certainly nothing about <unk> <unk> really is like something from the video vault
<unk> <unk> the young writer and director he is n't yet n has only one produced picture to his credit he wrote the screenplay for racing with the <unk> a lovely coming - of-age picture set in the n
both movies are infused with the nostalgic sensibility of someone much older someone who does n't dismiss dreams but who also has enough experience to see his limits
however <unk> <unk> directs his own material without sentimentality and at its own eccentric pace <unk> boys is both bluesy and funny
he put a fresh spin on material that could come off terribly cliched for example the way <unk> <unk> wows an audience the first time <unk> she sings with the <unk> boys
of course it does n't hurt that <unk> <unk> has made up for his lack of experience behind the camera with technicians who know exactly what they doing
much of the picture sensuality emerges from cinematographer <unk> <unk> slyly seductive lens work
after working for years with <unk> <unk> <unk> the late german director and more recently with <unk> <unk> after <unk> the <unk> of money the last temptation of <unk> <unk> <unk> has developed a distinctively fluid style
and <unk> <unk> witty score embraces the banal requirements of banquet - hall musicianship <unk> is a must without condescension
though <unk> <unk> has the flashy part she gets the best comic bits and to wear glamorous dresses and spiked heels the boys are pretty great too
what seemed like a good idea to cast the bridges brothers <unk> and <unk> as the <unk> brothers actually turned out to be a good idea
anyone who tried to appear natural in front of a camera knows that it much more natural to end up looking like a stiff
so it quite possible that the terrific play between the brothers is n't natural at all that <unk> and <unk> had to work like crazy to make their brotherly love and resentment and frustration and rage seem so very real
when the movie opens the <unk> brothers are doing what they done for n years professionally and twice as long as that for themselves they playing proficient piano face - to-face on twin pianos
they small time in the small time - hotels not the best ones and restaurants in <unk>
yet they do n't disparage their audiences by disparaging their act
they wear tuxedos most nights unless circumstances a regular gig at a tropical lounge for example require them to wear special costumes like hawaiian shirts
<unk> <unk> looking eager to please with his arched eyebrows and round face plays the older brother <unk>
<unk> plans the program takes care of business and approaches the work like any other job
he even able to think of a job that takes him out of the house <unk> nights a week as an ordinary job
he got a wife and two kids and a house in the suburbs the audience sees only the house and only near the end of the movie
<unk> grovels a little for the bookers probably no more or less than he would have to if he worked for a big corporation
on his off - hours he wears cardigan sweaters
<unk> <unk> is the younger brother <unk> who fancies himself the rebellious artist he lives in a loft with his sick dog and the occasional visit from the little girl upstairs who climbs down the fire escape
yet <unk> the one who can remember every dive n they ever played and when and he dutifully shows up for work night after night he consoles himself with booze and by showing up at the last minute
looking leaner than he has in a while the younger <unk> <unk> <unk> is sexy and cynical and a far sadder case than <unk> who managed to chisel his dreams to fit reality without feeling too cheated
he can live with little pleasures
<unk> <unk> has put together some priceless moments
these include <unk> <unk> audition to be the <unk> boys girl singer
<unk> <unk> of the tweety - bird voice showed great comic promise during her stint as the mobster girlfriend on the television show <unk> <unk> blues
here she delivers especially during her enthusiastically awful rendition of the <unk> man which she sings while prancing around in a little cotton candy pink angora sweater that could n't be more perfect
it matches her voice
and <unk> <unk> particular version of making <unk> and the way <unk> <unk> <unk> photographs her from the tips of her red high heels right up her clingy red velvet dress might make you think of <unk> <unk> if <unk> <unk> had n't gone and become a star in her own right
video tip

despite recent declines in interest rates money funds continue to offer better yields than other comparable investments
the average seven - day compound yield on the n taxable funds tracked by <unk> was <unk> in the latest week down from <unk>
compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends and that current yields continue for a year

money - fund yields tend to lag interestrate trends as portfolio managers adjust the maturities of their investments short - term <unk> securities commercial paper and the like to capture the highest yields
maturities usually are shorter when rates are rising and longer when they are falling
the average maturity of the funds tracked by <unk> remained at <unk> days for the third consecutive week
it was as short as <unk> days at the start of this year when rates were marching steadily upward and hit <unk> days in <unk>
the average seven - day simple yield of the funds fell to n this week from <unk>

whose <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> agency created liar <unk> <unk> among others announced a massive restructuring that largely removes it from the advertising business and includes selling the majority of its advertising unit to <unk> - based <unk>
the complex restructuring which was long expected transforms <unk> - based <unk> from primarily a creator of advertising into one of <unk> largest buyers of advertising time and space
it also creates a newly merged world - wide ad agency controlled by <unk> and headed jointly by <unk> <unk> ad man <unk> <unk> <unk> and two top <unk> executives
the merged agency admittedly ambitious goal to become one of the world n largest agencies while attracting more multinational clients than n the agencies were able to attract alone
<unk> restructuring reflects the growing importance of media buying in <unk> where the only way n to get a good price on advertising time and space is to buy it in bulk
for <unk> meanwhile the move gives it a strong <unk> foothold in <unk> <unk> and more than quadruples the size of its ad agency business world - wide
it also gives the outspoken <unk> <unk> <unk> who often generates as much publicity for himself as for his clients an international platform that he most certainly wo n't be loath to use
according to terms <unk> will pay n billion french francs n million for the <unk> <unk> it does n't already own of <unk> <unk> <unk> one of <unk> largest media buyers
meanwhile <unk> which had held n of <unk> ad unit will pay n million n million to raise its stake to <unk>
that price also covers <unk> raising to <unk> its <unk> stake in <unk> <unk> <unk> a joint venture ad agency network <unk> it owns with <unk>
<unk> will also have the right to buy the remaining n of the merged ad agency group in six years
the transaction places the three executives squarely at the helm of a major agency with the rather unwieldy name of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk>
the merged agency will include <unk> <unk> <unk> based in <unk> <unk> <unk> various agencies in <unk> the <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> other advertising and direct marketing operations
<unk> <unk> <unk> will be joint chairman with former <unk> executive <unk> <unk>
both will report to <unk> <unk> a former <unk> executive who will be chief executive officer at the new agency
in an interview in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> fresh from a <unk> flight from <unk> where executives had worked through most of the night outlined big plans for the new agency
our goal is to develop quite rapidly to a n position by the end of three years from now
it implies very dramatic growth he said
he added that <unk> and <unk> had agreed to provide a development fund of n million for acquisitions
the new agency group is already in discussions about a possible purchase in <unk> while <unk> <unk> said n it also plans to make acquisitions in <unk> <unk> and elsewhere
cracking the top n within three years will be difficult at best
<unk> <unk> had billings of just n million last year and ranked as the <unk> <unk> ad agency
the merged company that it now becomes part of will have billings of just more than n billion most of that in <unk> bringing it to about <unk> world - wide
to make it to n status it would have to leapfrog over such formidable forces as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
the merged agency game plan to attract multinational packaged - goods advertisers may prove equally difficult
when <unk> created <unk> <unk> <unk> out of the merger of three smaller agency units in <unk> it said <unk> it did so in order to attract larger clients especially packaged - goods companies
since then <unk> <unk> won <unk> <unk> as an international client and also does work for a few packaged - goods clients including <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
but major packaged - goods players of the world such as <unk> <unk> <unk> - <unk> and <unk> have steadfastly eluded the agency
three of our favorite names <unk> <unk> <unk> calls that roster adding hopefully we a much more attractive agency to large multinationals today than we were yesterday
still the restructuring could create one of the most powerful alliances between advertising and media - buying firms that <unk> has seen
as part of the restructuring <unk> and <unk> said n they will look for ways <unk> to combine their media buying across <unk>
what more both <unk> and brothers <unk> and <unk> <unk> who founded <unk> will acquire <unk> stakes in <unk> <unk> creating a powerful link between <unk> and <unk>
<unk> will receive its <unk> stake as part of payment for the <unk> <unk> stake that <unk> is buying while <unk> said n it expects to pay about n million for its <unk> stake
<unk> <unk> <unk> says n he plans to remain heavily involved in the creative product at the world - wide agency serving as a sort of creative conscience
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> president will continue running the <unk> agency day - to-day
they and other top executives signed long - term employment contracts and <unk> <unk> <unk> will receive an additional multimillion - dollar sum which some industry executives pegged at about n million
<unk> <unk> for its part will now be able to follow its longstanding plan of becoming a holding company for a series of media - related businesses said <unk> <unk> <unk> the firm chief executive
in addition to <unk> <unk> will hold onto its public relations tv programming and other businesses
<unk> says n its debt will be cut to n million from n million as a result of the transaction
for <unk> meanwhile the alliance with <unk> and <unk> is intended to strengthen its own push outside <unk>
<unk> <unk> brothers invented the idea of large - scale buying of media space
by buying the space in bulk they obtain discounts as high as n which they can pass on to customers
they thus have won the french space - buying business of such advertising giants as <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a. <unk> and <unk>
but now other agencies are getting into the business with their own competing media - buying groups and <unk> wants to expand to the rest of <unk>
to help finance the <unk> purchase <unk> said n it plans an issue of euroconvertible preferred shares once the market settles down
but <unk> added that in the light of the current uncertainty in the equity markets it has arranged medium - term debt financing which would be underwritten by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
earthquake
<unk> earthquake brought the <unk> <unk> ad scene to a screeching halt yesterday with only a few staffers showing up at their offices mainly to survey the damage or to wring their hands about imminent new - business presentations
while no agencies reported injuries to employees the quake damaged the offices of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> among others spokesmen for those agencies said n
staffers at <unk> whose offices are in the ultramodern <unk> <unk> watched pictures drop from the walls and then felt the skyscraper sway seven to eight feet according to a spokeswoman
plaster fell and windows were broken at <unk> a spokesman for that agency said <unk>
late yesterday afternoon <unk> <unk> executives were scrambling to figure out what to do about a new business presentation that had been scheduled for today a spokesman said n
<unk> <unk> office building may have sustained structural damage the spokesman added n
all operations have stopped he said
a number of agencies including <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> said n some employees who live outside of <unk> <unk> fearful that they would n't be able to get home spent the night at the agency

one of the most remarkable features of the forced marches of the ethnic turks out of <unk> over the past five months has been the lack of international attention
the deportation of more than n men women and children by the bulgarian regime adds up to one of the largest migrations seen in the postwar years
yet some people are advancing a chilling casuistry that what we are seeing is somehow the understandable result of the historical sins committed by the turks in the <unk> century
today turks in <unk> in other words deserve what is coming to them four centuries later
as if this were n't enough the <unk> <unk> <unk> is getting into the act
on <unk> it approved <unk> <unk> <unk> proposed commemorative resolution designating <unk> n <unk> as the <unk> <unk> of <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the armenian <unk> of <unk> suffered at the hands of the warring <unk> <unk>
there can be no quibbling that the armenians endured terrible suffering but one has to wonder what possible good such a resolution will achieve
it puts great strain on a longstanding <unk> friendship with <unk> a country that has been one of <unk> strongest allies in <unk>
the resolution also comes at a time when <unk> has been seeking help from the <unk> <unk> in resolving its bulgarian emigration controversy and pursuing democratic reforms that may lead to membership in the <unk> <unk>
<unk> has been fighting its past for years and thus far has been only partially successful
must it now accept that one of its strongest allies blames it for the genocide of another people
such sentiment only encourages the adverse feelings toward <unk> that surfaced when <unk> asked for assistance in dealing with its bulgarian emigration crisis
<unk> <unk> odd effort notwithstanding most of <unk> political problems lie with the europeans
part of the problem n some europeans have with <unk> seems to stem from its location <unk> is n't really part of <unk>
why they wonder n should it belong to the <unk>
another anti - turkish hook is the islamic faith of the majority of the turkish people <unk> we are told <unk> is not a christian nation its people simply wo n't fit in with the western european <unk> - christian tradition
it when these rationalizations fall on deaf ears that the old standby of retribution for treatment at the hands of the <unk> <unk> comes to the fore
no one has to accept the sins of the <unk> <unk> to reject that argument
<unk> in any event is long past it
the country has in recent years accepted more than n refugees from at least four bordering nations
kurds suffering what many people consider to be a current extermination campaign at the hands of <unk> <unk> and <unk> have inundated eastern <unk>
now it is their fellow turks arriving as refugees from <unk>
the turkish refugee tragedy and the ongoing crisis can not be ignored and shuttled off to that notorious dustbin of history that has become so convenient recently
surely the past suffering of any people at any time can not be simply filed away and forgotten
but what the <unk> <unk> <unk> has done in supporting the strongly worded armenian resolution achieves no useful end it merely produces more controversy and embittered memories
<unk> has enough difficulty dealing with the realities of the world as it currently exists
<unk> government has been behaving beyond the pale for months and the <unk> does its values no credit by ignoring that while casting its votes into the past
many in <unk> say <unk> <unk> <unk> will have to raise taxes to pay for his war on drugs
we have a better idea dismantle <unk> to pay for the war on drugs
<unk> and <unk> <unk> budget is n billion
from what we and the nation have been reading the money is n't being spent very well
the single most important contribution n the government could make now to help the poor is to get the specter of drugs out of their neighborhoods
if that takes money take it away from this discredited federal department
but of course the democrats pillorying <unk> in hearings and in the press have no such solution in mind
instead they scrambling to protect the very programs at the heart of the <unk> scandal
this month <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> unveiled a series of proposed reforms n to improve management at <unk>
no doubt many of his ideas are worthy but ultimately he is proposing to make fundamentally flawed programs work slightly more fairly and efficiently
<unk> is unlikely to go even that far
last week <unk> <unk> ran into a buzzsaw of criticism from <unk> <unk> <unk> members
they were appalled for instance that he wanted to target more of the <unk> billion <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> program to low - income projects and zero out the notorious discretionary funds that have allowed <unk> officials to steer contracts to political cronies
these development grants mainly enrich developers who want to put up shopping centers and parking garages
they also give those in <unk> political credit for bringing home the pork and so they are popular with such members as <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> a <unk> from <unk> wants a n million grant so <unk> can build an <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk>
she says n it create n jobs and bring <unk> tourist revenue
<unk> says n the project does n't qualify and <unk> <unk> says that rock roll musicians and the music industry ought to put up the money
at the hearing <unk> <unk> started wailing about phoney baloney regulations that would stand between her and housing for downtown <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> an <unk> <unk> rallied to the cause i think n the gentlelady is making an important statement
the implication that if a congressman calls about a project in his district there something wrong i think n is most unfortunate
we sure n some theologian can explain the difference between what the republican consultants have been doing with <unk> and what these gentleladies and gentlemen want to do with <unk>
our view is that given <unk> attitude toward <unk> the place probably is beyond reform
for more than n years the federal government has tried various ways <unk> to provide housing for the poor and revive cities
in the process <unk> has wasted untold billions created slums and invited corruption
much of <unk> spending actually is disguised welfare for developers or the middle class
that includes the <unk> funds and the <unk> <unk> <unk> which loans out money for private home mortgages and has just been discovered to be n billion in the hole
selling the <unk> loan portfolio to the highest bidder would save the taxpayers untold billions in future losses
some <unk> money actually does trickle down to the poor and zeroing out housing middlemen would free up more money for public housing tenants to manage and even own their units
the rest ought to be used to clean out drugs from the neighbhorhoods
rival gangs have turned cities into combat zones
even suburban <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> reported last week n there have been a record n killings there this year most of them drug - related
innocent bystanders often are the victims
a man in a wheelchair was gunned down in the crossfire of a <unk> drug battle
a three - year-old <unk> boy was used as a shield by a drug dealer
decent life in the inner cities wo n't be restored unless the government reclaims the streets from the drug gangs
until then the billions <unk> <unk> spends on inner - city housing simply is wasted
it still unclear whether <unk> <unk> wants to completely overhaul the engine room at <unk> or just tighten a few screws here and there
no doubt he believes n the place can be salvaged
having seen the hypocrisy with which <unk> has addressed the <unk> scandals we disagree
it time n to scrap the politically infested spending machine <unk> <unk> has become and channel the resources into the drug war
<unk> <unk> was named chairman and chief executive officer of this grocery chain
<unk> <unk> <unk> years old succeeds <unk> <unk> <unk> who died in a plane crash on <unk> at the age of <unk>
<unk> <unk> retains his position as president
natural upheavals and most particularly earthquakes are not only horrible realities in and of themselves but also symbols through which the state of a society can be construed
the rubble after the armenian earthquake a year ago disclosed quite literally a city whose larger structures had been built with sand
the extent of the disaster stemmed from years of chicanery and bureaucratic indifference
the larger parallel after the earthquake centered south of <unk> <unk> is surely with the state of the <unk> economy
did the stock - market tremors of <unk> <unk> n presage larger fragility far greater upheavals
are the engineering and architecture of the economy as vulnerable as the spans of the <unk> <unk>
the eerie complacency of the <unk> - <unk> era has produced panglossian paeans about the present perfection of <unk> economic and social arrangements
a licensed government intellectual <unk> <unk> recently announced in the <unk> <unk> that history is so to speak at an end since the course of human progress has now culminated in the glorious full stop of american civilization
his observations were taken seriously
but we are in reality witnessing the continuing decline of the political economy of capitalism not so much the end of history but the history of the end
the financial equivalent of the sand used by those armenian contractors is junk bonds and the leveraged buy - outs associated with them
builders get away with using sand and financiers junk when society decides n it okay necessary even to look the other way
and by the early n <unk> capitalists had ample reason n to welcome junk bonds to look the other way
by that time they found extremely low profit rates from non - financial corporate investment
government statistics in fact show that the profit rate net pretax profits divided by capital stock peaked in <unk> at n
that same calculation saw profit rates fall to n in the recession year <unk> and the supposed miracle that followed has seen the profit rate rise only to <unk> in <unk> and <unk> in <unk>
corresponding to the fall in profit rates was in the early <unk> the drop in the number arrived at if you divide the market value of firms by the replacement costs of their assets the famous <unk> ratio associated with <unk> . <unk> <unk>
in theory the value attached to a firm by the market and the cost of replacing its assets should be the same
but of course the market could decide that the firm capital stock its assets means nothing if the firm is not producing profits
this is indeed what the market decided
by <unk> the ratio was n meaning that the market was valuing every dollar worth of the average firm assets at n cents
from the history of capitalism we can take it as a sound bet that if it takes only n cents to buy a dollar worth of a firm capital stock an alert entrepreneur wo n't look the other way
his assumption is that the underlying profitability rate will go up and <unk> the capital assets n he bought on the cheap will soon be producing profits thus restoring the market faith in them
hence the lbo craze
but here is where the entrepreneur made a very risky bet and where society was maybe foolish to look the other way
the profit rate is still low and the <unk> ratio was only <unk> in <unk> and <unk> in <unk>
result a landscape littered with lemons huge debt burdens crushing down upon the arch and spans of corporate <unk>
the mounting risks did not go unobserved even in the n
but there were enough promoters announcing the end of history in this case suspension of normal laws of economic gravity for society to continue shielding its eyes
mainstream economists and commentators craning their necks up at the great pyramids of junk financing swiveling their heads to watch the avalanche of leveraged buy - outs claimed <unk> the end result would be a leaner meaner corporate <unk> with soaring productivity and profits and the weaker gone to the wall
but this is not where the rewards of junk financing were found
the beneficiaries were those financiers whose icon was the topic figure of <unk> capitalism <unk> <unk> n million salary in one year
left - stream economists n i associate with fellows in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> economists most particularly <unk> <unk> of the economics faculty at the <unk> of <unk> at <unk> were not hypnotized in the manner of their pliant colleagues
all along they have been noting the tremors and pointing out the underlying realities
profit rates after the great merger wave are no higher and now we have an extremely high - interest burden relative to cash flow
the consequences of building empires with sand are showing up
in contrast to previous estimates reckoning the default rate on junk bonds at <unk> or <unk> a <unk> study published in <unk> of this year and discussed in a lead story in the <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> n found n the default rate on these junk bonds is n
what is the consequence of a high - interest burden high default rates and continued low profitability
corporations need liquidity in the form of borrowed funds
without liquidity from the junk - bond market or cash flow from profits they look to the government which obediently assists the natural motions of the capitalist economy with charity in the form of cuts in the capital - gains tax rate or bailouts
the consequence can be inflation brought on as the effect of a desperate bid to avoid the deflationary shock of a sudden crash
attacks on inflation come with another strategy of capital of a very traditional sort an assault on wages
<unk> <unk> peering through binoculars at the end of history said in his essay that the class issue has actually been successfully resolved in the <unk>
the egalitarianism of modern <unk> represents the essential achievement of the classless society envisioned by <unk>
<unk> <unk> might want to consult some american workers on the subject of class and egalitarianism
from its peak in <unk> of <unk> the average american weekly wage had fallen to <unk> in <unk> both figures being expressed in n dollars
in other words after the glory boom of the <unk> years wages had sunk from the post <unk> <unk> <unk> peak by <unk> as capitalists helped by the government turned down the screws or went offshore
but there are signs now the strikes by miners <unk> workers telephone workers etc . that this attack on wages is being more fiercely resisted
these are long - term <unk> readings on american capitalism
the whole structure is extremely shaky
governments have become sophisticated in handling moments of panic a word <unk> the <unk> <unk> forbade my father to use when he was reporting the <unk> <unk> crash in <unk>
but sophistication has its limits
the s&l bailout could cost n billion computing interest on the government loans
these are real costs
under what weights will the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> totter
capitalism may now be engineered to withstand sudden shocks but there are fault lines the crisis in profits the assault on wages the structural inequity of the system that make fools of those who claim that the future is here and that history is over
<unk> <unk> is a columnist for the <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> reportedly plan to form an international air - freight company this year a move that could further consolidate the industry
japanese newspaper <unk> <unk> <unk> reported that the three giants plan to integrate their cargo computers and ground - cargo and air - cargo systems
they reportedly will invest a total of n billion yen n million in the venture whose headquarters would be in <unk> or <unk> <unk>
the action follows <unk> <unk> <unk> acquisition of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>
after that it would make sense for airlines to talk about doing things jointly said <unk> <unk> <unk> director of cargo services for <unk> <unk> consulting firm <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> said <unk> such discussions are motivated by the competitive threat posed by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and other fast - growing air - freight companies
many airlines are talking about cargo ventures and there have been rumors about such a tie between <unk> and european airlines
in <unk> a <unk> spokesman said n he could n't confirm or deny the latest japanese report
but he said <unk> <unk> is talking to <unk> and <unk> <unk> about some sort of cargo venture
it is just one of a number of strategies <unk> <unk> has embarked upon to come to terms with the situation in <unk> after <unk> the deadline for ending trade barriers in the <unk> he said n
in <unk> a <unk> spokesman confirmed n talks are under way but declined to comment
a <unk> spokeswoman in <unk> said <unk> the head of <unk> cargo operations had been in <unk> last week for talks with <unk>
in <unk> <unk> <unk> declined to comment
nothing is defined or signed at this point <unk> <unk> said of the talks
whatever accord the three carriers reach he said n he is skeptical <unk> it would create a separate airline
if the three companies pool their air - freight businesses their clout would be considerable
according to figures from the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> they carried a combined n million tons of freight last year
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> as separate companies carried a combined n million tons
<unk> <unk> and <unk> last month concluded a far - reaching cooperation accord that includes air - freight activities
they plan to increase cooperation in freight ground - handling and create a world - wide computer system <unk> to process cargo
other airlines would have access to the system they said <unk> and negotiations with partners were already under way
both european airlines operate extensive fleets of <unk> <unk> freighters and <unk> <unk> aircraft that carry both freight and passengers on the main deck
they currently have large orders for cargo planes
several airlines including <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> airways are working on a so - called global cargo system and are trying to attract other carriers to join <unk> <unk> said <unk>
<unk> also has signaled n it is looking for toeholds in <unk> before the end of <unk>
last month the carrier said n it wanted to lease crews and planes from <unk> airways so it could funnel its passengers from <unk> to other european destinations
<unk> <unk> said <unk> it has n't received a proposal from <unk>
but last week there were air - traffic negotiations between the <unk> and <unk> a likely first step to any commercial agreement between <unk> and <unk> airways or another <unk> carrier
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> it completed the previously announced purchase of <unk> <unk> <unk> a closely held maker of paper cups based in <unk> <unk>
terms were n't disclosed
<unk> <unk> has annual sales of approximately n million

in a move to prevent any dislocation in the financial markets from the <unk> earthquake the securities and <unk> <unk> said <unk> it temporarily reassigned options listed on the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the american <unk> <unk> and <unk> stock exchanges and to the <unk> <unk> options <unk>
the decision which affects millions of dollars of trading positions was made late yesterday because the <unk> exchange options floor was shut down as a result of <unk> earthquake
the <unk> faced with a major squeeze on options positions said <unk> it was necessary to ensure that options listed on the exchange could be traded today and tomorrow
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> the cooperation by the exchanges would enable investors to buy and sell options listed solely on the <unk> exchange guaranteeing the liquidity of the market
officials at the four exchanges said n well over <unk> traders from the <unk> exchange were taking flights from <unk> <unk> late yesterday to the american <unk> <unk> and <unk> exchanges and to the <unk> where they would continue making markets in the <unk> - listed options
the <unk> <unk> said n carpenters quickly erected a new options floor n to accomodate n traders from the <unk> exchange
in addition specialists on the exchanges agreed to provide backup capital for market - making in <unk> exchange options traded on the exchanges
trading was light on the <unk> <unk> <unk> yesterday with workers at the exchange main floor in <unk> <unk> struggling to execute orders by flashlight as a result of a continuing power outage
the most pressing problem was the suspension of options trading
the <unk> exchange has options for n underlying stock issues including highly active <unk> hotels <unk> which is listed on the <unk> <unk>
investors were concerned that they might be unable to exercise options that expire tomorrow
but professionals said throughout the day that the shutdown would n't be a cause for alarm even if it were to persist for several days
i told my staff and clients that they still have the ability to exercise their options because they are guaranteed by the options <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> a senior registered options strategist at <unk> <unk>
the <unk> reassigned trading in the options however to allow investors to do more than simply exercise the options
while the exchange equities floor in <unk> <unk> remained open on a limited basis orders were being routed and executed in <unk> <unk>
workers could dial out but they could n't receive telephone calls
it a very uncertain situation right now said <unk> <unk> administrative assistant of trading floor operations of the exchange which has daily volume of about n million shares
because the exchange computer was rerouting orders to the exchange trading operations in <unk> <unk> business is as usual <unk> <unk> said <unk>
if one city is down the other can take over
meanwhile the brokerage firms in <unk> <unk> were trying to cope
<unk> <unk> chairman and chief executive officer of <unk> <unk> said <unk> traders came to work at n a.m. <unk> many on foot because of uncertain road and traffic conditions but learned that they would have to await a required inspection by the city in order to turn the power back on at the company two main facilities there
that should happen by today he said n
traders worked with the help of sunlight streaming through windows despite large cracks in the walls and a lack of incoming phone calls
also most of the telecommunications equipment was out
the traders were executing municipal bond mutual fund and other orders through a sister firm <unk> <unk> <unk> which is also owned by <unk> <unk> <unk> securities but is based in <unk> <unk>
we are having a regular day
volume is down out of <unk> <unk> but not out of the <unk> outlying offices <unk> <unk> added
<unk> <unk> office executed orders through the <unk> office which was n't affected by the quake
others like <unk> - <unk> securities <unk> which has eight offices in the <unk> <unk> area set up an n number yesterday morning for customers to obtain market commentary and other help
at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> branch manager <unk> <unk> received calls yesterday morning from workers in <unk> <unk> who offered to work in <unk>
then she discovered that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> lines were down because they are normally tied in through a system that goes through <unk> <unk>
so the <unk> brokers had to call other company offices to get quotes on stocks
at <unk> the company <unk> call - in <unk> which swung into action for the first time last month for <unk> <unk> assembled a tactical team at n a.m. yesterday n to begin rerouting lines and restore service to brokers and traders
the company dispatched as many as n people in the <unk> <unk> area <unk> to do the work though most of the rerouting was done by computer
service appeared to be down throughout the financial district in downtown <unk> <unk> while just parts of <unk> and <unk> <unk> were knocked out
but <unk> <unk> director of the emergency center said <unk> service was being restored to outlying <unk> <unk> areas
in <unk> yesterday options <unk> confirmed that it guarantees the <unk> exchange options
the firm also will permit its members and the public to exercise their put and call options contracts traded on the <unk> exchange even if the exchange is closed said <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman of options <unk>
put options give holders the right but not the obligation to sell a financial instrument at a specified price while call options give holders the right but not the obligation to buy a financial instrument at a specified price
investors and traders in <unk> exchange options are protected to the extent that they can convert their put and call options into the underlying instrument <unk> <unk> said <unk>
we are seeing such exercises today in fact
<unk> <unk> machines <unk> said <unk> its board approved the purchase of <unk> billion of its common shares a move that should help support its battered stock
even as the stock market has generally done well this year <unk> shares have slipped steadily from its <unk> high of n
yesterday closing price of <unk> down n cents in composite trading on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> puts the stock at about <unk> <unk> times book value which is as low as it has sunk over the past decade
the announcement came after the market close
the move by <unk> was n't exactly a surprise
the company has spent some n billion over the past <unk> <unk> years to buy back n million common shares or roughly <unk> of those outstanding
in addition despite <unk> well - publicized recent problems the computer giant still generates enormous amounts of cash
as of the end of the second quarter it had <unk> billion of cash and marketable securities on hand
as a result some securities analysts had predicted in recent days that <unk> would authorize additional purchases
in <unk> <unk> a spokesman said that although <unk> did n't view its spending as necessarily a way n to support the stock it thought <unk> the purchases were a good way n to improve such financial measurements as per - share earnings and return on equity
we view it as a good long - term investment the spokesman said
in the short term the move is likely to have little effect
at yesterday closing price n billion would buy back about n million shares or less than n of the roughly n million outstanding
in addition as of <unk> n the company still had authorization to buy <unk> million of stock under a prior repurchase program
over the long term however <unk> stock repurchases along with its hefty <unk> annual dividend and generally loyal following among large institutional investors are providing a floor for the stock price
although <unk> last year produced its first strong results in four years and was expected to continue to roll this year it began faltering as early as <unk>
first it had trouble manufacturing a chip for its mainframes <unk> bread - and-butter business
then it had a series of smaller glitches including problems manufacturing certain personal computers and the delay in the announcement of some important workstations
finally <unk> had to delay the introduction of some high - end disk drives which account for <unk> of its <unk> billion of annual revenue
none of the problems is necessarily fatal and they are n't all necessarily even related
there are also other factors at work that are outside <unk> control such as currency exchange rates
the strong dollar which reduces the value of overseas earnings and revenue when they are translated into dollars is expected to knock <unk> to n cents off <unk> per - share earnings for the full year
without that problem <unk> might have matched last year earnings of <unk> billion or <unk> a share
still investors will take some convincing before they get back into <unk> stock in a big way
<unk> <unk> a securities analyst at <unk> <unk> said that while investors were looking for an excuse n to buy <unk> shares a year ago even the big institutional investors are looking for a reason n to avoid the stock these days
on <unk> <unk> yesterday northern <unk> killer earthquake was just another chance to make a buck
at the opening bell investors quickly began singling out shares of companies <unk> expected to profit or suffer in some way from the <unk> disaster including insurers construction - related companies refiners and housing lenders
brokerage houses jumped in touting post - quake demand stocks and <unk> <unk> <unk> set up a toll - free hot line for <unk> <unk> who might need emergency investment advice and help in transferring funds
<unk> <unk> thinks of everything in terms of money says <unk> <unk> a senior <unk> <unk> trader
however he added <unk> such event - driven trading moves typically last only a few hours and are often made without full information
the most popular plays of the day were insurance companies such as <unk> <unk> <unk> which rose <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> up <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> up <unk> to <unk> and <unk> <unk> up <unk> cents to <unk>
yesterday the brokerage firm <unk> <unk> said <unk> insurers will use the earthquake as an excuse n to raise insurance rates ending their long price wars
before this bullish theory surfaced some insurance stocks initially fell indicating that investors thought n the quake might cost insurers a lot of money
in fact <unk> <unk> <unk> which ended the day off <unk> cents to <unk> said <unk> earthquake damage would slightly hurt fourth - quarter profit
on the prospect for rebuilding northern <unk> investors bid up cement - makers <unk> <unk> up <unk> to <unk> and <unk> <unk> industries <unk> up <unk> to n

<unk> stock market plunge claimed its second victim among the scores of futures and options trading firms here
<unk> options an options trading firm owned by the family of the deceased former <unk> <unk> of <unk> chairman <unk> <unk> is getting out of the trade clearing or processing and guaranteeing business after sustaining a multimillion dollar loss <unk> options industry officials said n
nearly n options traders on the <unk> <unk> options <unk> who cleared trades through <unk> including a handful of traders who lost between <unk> to n million themselves as a result of <unk> debacle are trying to transfer their business to other clearing firms <unk> members said n
<unk> <unk> <unk> chief executive officer confirmed that <unk> was withdrawing from the clearing business
the owners of the company got a look at the potential risks in this business and after <unk> they felt n they did n't want to be exposed any more he said
he added that <unk> remained in compliance with all industry capital requirements during the market rapid plunge <unk> and <unk> rebound
a <unk> spokeswoman declined comment on <unk>
over the weekend <unk> <unk> another options trading firm transferred the clearing accounts of about <unk> traders to <unk> options of <unk> a unit of <unk> <unk> <unk> because it could n't meet regulatory capital requirements after <unk> market slide
the unprecedented transfer of accounts underscored the options industry desire not to have its credibility tarnished by potentially widespread trading defaults on <unk>
the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> options <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> owner of <unk> joined in putting up n million to guarantee the accounts at <unk> options
the head of another small options clearing firm who asked not to be identified said that the heightened volatility in the financial markets in recent years makes it increasingly difficult for any but the largest financial trading firms to shoulder the risk inherent in the highly leveraged options and futures business
prior to the introduction of financial futures in the late n most trading firms clustered around the <unk> <unk> financial district here were family operations handed down from one generation to the next
most also were relatively undercapitalized compared with the size of most <unk> <unk> securities firms
<unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> legend among the post - <unk> <unk> <unk> generation of commodity traders was rumored to have amassed a multimillion - dollar fortune from commodity trading and other activities by the time n he died in <unk>
part of a <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a mild - mannered homemaker and grandmother in rural <unk> <unk> <unk>
but put her behind a shopping cart and she turns ruthless
if <unk> toothpaste offers a tempting money - saving coupon she cross <unk> off her shopping list without a second thought
never mind that her husband prefers <unk>
some weeks when her supermarket runs a double - coupon promotion she boasts that she shaves n off her bill
money is n't the only thing that makes her dump once favorite brands
after she heard about the artery - clogging hazards of tropical oils in many cookies she dropped <unk> <unk> and started buying brands free of such oils
i always thought <unk> <unk> <unk> was tasty and high quality <unk> <unk> says
but i do n't want any of that oil for my grandkids
<unk> <unk> says n it ca n't tell exactly how many customers it has lost but it hopes to remove the objectionable tropical oil from all its products by year end
clearly people like <unk> <unk> are giving marketers fits
she represents a new breed of savvy consumer who puts bargain prices nutritional and environmental concerns and other priorities ahead of old - fashioned brand loyalty
while brand loyalty is far from dead marketing experts say n it has eroded during the n
marketers themselves are partly to blame they increased spending for coupons and other short - term promotions at the expense of image - building advertising
what more a flood of new products has given consumers a dizzying choice of brands many of which are virtually carbon copies of one other
marketers have brought this on themselves with their heavy use of promotions contends <unk> <unk> <unk> an executive vice president at the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ad agency
without some real product improvements it going to be difficult to win that loyalty back
the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of buying survey this year found that most consumers switch brands for many of the products n they use
for the survey <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> associates asked some n consumers including <unk> <unk> whether they usually buy one brand of a certain type of product or have no brand loyalty
more than half the users of <unk> of the n products included in the survey said <unk> they brand switchers
overall <unk> of consumers are n't brand loyal for any of the <unk> product categories
about n are loyal for one to five of the products
only <unk> are brand loyal in <unk> to n of the categories and no one is loyal for more than n types of products
for such products as canned vegetables and athletic shoes devotion to a single brand was quite low with fewer than <unk> saying n they usually buy the same brand
only for cigarettes mayonnaise and toothpaste did more than <unk> of users say n they typically stick with the same brand
people tend to be most loyal to brands that have distinctive flavors such as cigarettes and ketchup
<unk> <unk> a respondent in the <unk> survey from <unk> <unk> says <unk> her husband is adamant about eating only <unk> ketchup
he simply ca n't stomach the taste of <unk> she says n
the n homemaker adds the only other thing <unk> i really loyal to is my <unk> <unk> cigarettes
<unk> and <unk> are all the same to me and i usually buy whichever brand of coffee happens to be on sale
brand imagery plays a significant role in loyalty to such products as cigarettes perfume and beer
people often stay with a particular brand because they want to be associated with the image n its advertising conveys whether that macho <unk> cigarettes or <unk> <unk> perfume
loyalty lags most for utilitarian products like trash bags and batteries
only n of trash - bag users in the <unk> survey usually buy the same brand and just n of battery buyers stick to one brand
underwear scored a middling n in brand loyalty but consumer researchers say <unk> that actually quite high for such a mundane product
in the past you just wore <unk> of the <unk> and did n't care says <unk> <unk> <unk> director of consumer behavior research for the <unk> <unk> <unk> ad agency
the high score reflects the attempts to make underwear more of a fashion image business for both men and women
he believes n there opportunity for a smart gasoline marketer to create a strong brand image and more consumer loyalty
what loyalty n there is to gas brands he believes <unk> is a matter of stopping at the most conveniently located service stations
brand loyalty was stronger among older consumers in the <unk> survey
nearly one - fourth of participants age n and older claim brand loyalty for more than <unk> of the n products in the survey only n of those age <unk> to n have such strong allegiance
higher - income people also tend to be more brand loyal these days the <unk> survey and other research studies indicate n
marketers speculate that more affluent people tend to lead more pressured lives and do n't have time n to research the products n they buy for the highest quality and most reasonable price
an established brand name is insurance that at least the product will be of acceptable quality if not always the best value for the money
it sort of loyalty by default
meanwhile the bottom end of the market is becoming less loyal says <unk> <unk> <unk> vice chairman of the ad agency <unk> <unk> partners
they buying whatever cheaper
the biggest wild card in the brand loyalty game how those hotly pursued but highly unpredictable baby boomers will behave as they move into middle age
they grew up with more brand choices than any generation and have shown less allegiance so far
but now that they settling down and raising families might they also show more stability in their brand choices
<unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> does n't think so
he believes <unk> baby boomers will continue to be selective in their brand loyalties
earlier generations were brand loyal across categories he says but boomers tend to be brand loyal in categories like running shoes and bottled water but less so in others like toilet paper and appliances
while not as brand loyal as in the past consumers today do n't buy products capriciously either
rather they tend to have a set of two or three favorites
sometimes they choose <unk> spaghetti sauce other times it will be <unk>
advertisers attribute this shared loyalty to the striking similarity among brands
if a more absorbent pampers hits the market you can be sure n a new and improved huggies wo n't be far behind
the <unk> <unk> ad agency studied brand parity and found that consumers believe <unk> all brands are about the same in a number of categories particularly credit cards paper towels dry soups and snack chips
when there a clutter of brands consumers simplify the complexity by telling themselves all brands are the same so what difference does it make which i buy says <unk> <unk> a senior vice president at <unk>
too often advertising imagery has n't done a good job of forging a special emotional bond between a brand and the consumer
but given such strong brand disloyalty some marketers are putting renewed emphasis on image advertising
a small but growing number of companies are also trying to instill more fervent brand loyalty through such personalized direct - marketing ploys as catalogs magazines and membership clubs for brand users
while discount promotions are essential for most brands some companies concede <unk> they went overboard in shifting money from advertising to coupons refunds and other sales incentives
some people argue that strong brands can afford to stop advertising for a time because of the residual impact of hundreds of millions of dollars spent on advertising through the years
but most companies are too afraid to take that chance
and perhaps with good reason
says <unk> <unk> president of the <unk> <unk> ad agency <unk> division every time n n hours pass without any advertising reinforcement brand loyalty will diminish ever so slightly even for a powerful brand like <unk>
consider for example what happened to <unk> <unk> coffee
the <unk> <unk> foods brand stopped advertising for about a year in <unk> and gave up several market share points and its leadership position in the coffee business
but since returning to advertising <unk> <unk> has regained the lost share and is running neck and neck with archrival <unk>
now <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> foods parent company is committed to the coffee business and to increased advertising for <unk> <unk> says <unk> <unk> president of the <unk> foods <unk> division
even though brand loyalty is rather strong for coffee we need advertising to maintain and strengthen it
<unk> <unk> <unk> for one has concluded that it makes good sense to focus more on its most loyal customers than on people who buy competitive brands
the probability of converting a non - user to your brand is about three in <unk> says <unk> <unk> the company vice president for marketing research
the best odds are with your core franchise
our heavy users consume two to three cans of soup a week and we like to increase that
so <unk> is talking to its brand enthusiasts probing their psychological attachment to its soup
in one consumer focus group a fan declared that <unk> soup is like getting a hug from a friend
that helped persuade the company to introduce a new advertising slogan a warm hug from <unk>
insurers face the prospect of paying out billions of dollars for damages caused by this week <unk> earthquake
getting a grip on the extent of the damages is proving a far more difficult task than what insurers faced after <unk> <unk> ripped through the <unk> and the carolinas last month
the earthquake toll including possible deep structural damage goes far beyond the more easily observed damage from a hurricane says <unk> <unk> <unk> a vice president in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> claims division
but investors are betting that the financial and psychological impact of the earthquake coming so soon after the hurricane will help stem more than two years of intense price - cutting wars among business insurers
reflecting that logic insurance - company stocks posted strong gains
<unk> and other insurers are hiring engineers and architects <unk> to help them assess structural damage
most insurers already have mobilized their catastrophe teams to begin processing claims from their policyholders in northern <unk>
since commercial air travel is interrupted <unk> based in <unk> <unk> chartered three planes n to fly claims adjusters into <unk> and then planned for them to drive to the <unk> area
about n adjusters were dispatched yesterday afternoon along with laptop computers cellular phones and blank checks
some adjusters already in other parts of <unk> drove to the disaster area with recreational vehicles and mobile homes that could be used as makeshift claims - processing centers
insurers will be advertising <unk> numbers probably on the radio that policyholders can call to get assistance on how to submit claims
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the largest home and auto insurer in <unk> believes n the losses from the earthquake could be somewhat less than the <unk> million in damages n it expects to pay out for claims resulting from <unk> <unk>
state <unk> based in <unk> <unk> is also the largest writer of personal - property earthquake insurance in <unk>
earthquake insurance is sold as a separate policy or a specific endorsement rider on a homeowner policy in <unk> because of the area vulnerability to earthquakes
<unk> <unk> said <unk> about n of its policyholders in <unk> have also purchased earthquake insurance
<unk> <unk> <unk> a unit of <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> about n of its personal property policyholders about <unk> in the <unk> <unk> area also have earthquake coverage
the <unk> of <unk> <unk> companies estimated n damage to residential property could total n million but only n million to n million is insured it said <unk>
officials from the <unk> <unk> <unk> property - claim service division which coordinates the efforts of the claims adjusters in an area after a natural disaster will be flying to <unk> <unk> today
they expect to have a preliminary estimate of the damages in a day or two
roads and bridges in the <unk> area appear to have suffered some of the most costly damage
highways such as the section of <unk> <unk> that collapsed in <unk> generally do n't have insurance coverage
industry officials say n the <unk> <unk> unlike some bridges has no earthquake coverage either so the cost of repairing it probably would have to be paid out of state general operating funds
however the bridge which charges a n toll each way does have loss of income insurance n to replace lost revenue if the operation of the bridge is interrupted for more than seven days
that coverage is provided by a syndicate of insurance companies including <unk> <unk> <unk> based in <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> based in <unk>
earthquake - related claims are n't expected to cause significant financial problems for the insurance industry as a whole
instead even with the liabilities of two natural disasters in recent weeks analysts said n the total capital of the industry is likely to be higher at year end than it was at midyear
indeed the earthquake could contribute to a turnaround in the insurance cycle in a couple of ways
for example insurers may seek to limit their future exposure to catastrophes by increasing the amount of reinsurance n they buy
such increased demand for reinsurance along with the losses <unk> the reinsurers will bear from these two disasters are likely to spur increases in reinsurance prices that will later be translated into an overall price rise
reinsurance is protection taken out by the insurance firms themselves
we are saying n this is the breaking point this is the event that will change the psychology of the marketplace said <unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk> a <unk> firm that specializes in the insurance industry
his firm along with some others issued new buy recommendations on insurer stocks yesterday
among the insurance stocks big gainers included <unk> <unk> <unk> up <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> up <unk> to <unk> <unk> up <unk> to <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> up <unk> to n
still a few individual companies most likely smaller ones could be devastated
i think n there is a damned good chance n someone is going to hit the skids on this said <unk> <unk> analyst <unk> <unk>
he suspects n some insurers who had purchased reinsurance to limit their exposure to catastrophes will discover <unk> that reinsurance was used up by <unk> <unk>
british west german <unk> and other overseas insurers are bracing for big claims from the <unk> <unk> earthquake disaster
although it unclear how much exposure the <unk> market will face <unk> underwriters traditionally have a large reinsurance exposure to <unk> catastrophe coverage
<unk> <unk> chairman of <unk> <unk> said n this disaster will test the catastrophe reinsurance market causing these rates to soar
the catastrophe losses sustained by insurers this year will probably be the worst on an inflation - adjusted basis since <unk> when another earthquake sparked the great <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> an insurance consultant in <unk> <unk> estimates that the <unk> <unk> <unk> destruction on an inflation - adjusted basis included insured losses of <unk> billion
he is estimating n this week disaster will generate insured losses of <unk> billion to n billion following about <unk> billion in costs to insurers from <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> first - quarter profit rose sharply to n million or n cents a share from n million or six cents a share a year ago
the maker of computer workstations said <unk> a surge of government orders contributed to the increase
revenue rose <unk> to n million from n million the year earlier
in national over - the-counter trading the company closed yesterday at <unk> a share down n cents
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said n it reached a preliminary accord on the sale of its environmental consulting and services business for about n million and assumption of related debt
the buyer was n't identified
the company said n it also is making progress in negotiating the buy - out of its design division by management
in addition <unk> said n it will use proceeds from a private placement of n million of preferred shares to purchase an interest in a start - up company n to underwrite environmental impairment insurance
<unk> wants to concentrate its resources on the insurance business and on a project n to store hazardous wastes in salt domes
<unk> <unk> chairman said <unk> he hopes to reach a friendly pact with <unk> motors <unk> within a month that may involve the british luxury - car maker producing a cheaper executive model
<unk> <unk> <unk> told reporters at <unk> <unk> yesterday <unk> he would be disappointed if we could n't do the deal within a month
he said <unk> the tie - up would mean <unk> <unk> could develop cars down range in price from where we are by offering access to <unk> high - volume parts production
besides creating joint manufacturing ventures the accord is expected to give <unk> about a <unk> stake that eventually would rise to about <unk>
<unk> figures n a friendly alliance with <unk> will fend off unwelcome advances from <unk> <unk> <unk>
but <unk> <unk> biggest shareholder since lifting its stake to n this week is pressing harder for talks with <unk> <unk>
we getting to the point where we are going to have to meet with him one <unk> official said <unk> yesterday
<unk> probably will renew its request for such a meeting soon he added n
<unk> <unk> has spurned <unk> advances since the <unk> auto giant launched a surprise bid for as much as <unk> of <unk> last month
<unk> has signaled n it might acquire a majority interest later
i not obligated to sit down and talk to anybody the <unk> chairman asserted yesterday
he did n't rule out negotiations with <unk> however
the fiercely proud but financially strapped british company prefers to remain independent and publicly held despite <unk> promise of access to cash and technological know - how
<unk> <unk> noted that <unk> a longtime <unk> supplier agrees n we should remain an independent company
he said <unk> <unk> started negotiating with <unk> and several other car makers over a year ago but the rest dropped by the wayside ever since the share price went above <unk> <unk> a share
<unk> shares stood at <unk> pence before <unk> initial announcement but the subsequent takeover frenzy has driven them up
the stock traded late yesterday on <unk> stock exchange at <unk> pence up n pence
developing an executive - model range would mark a major departure for <unk> leading luxury - car maker
a typical british executive car is mass produced and smaller than a luxury car
it generally fetches no more than <unk> <unk> roughly n less than the highest - priced jaguars which are all known for their hand - crafted leather work
we have designs for such executive cars but have never been able to develop them <unk> <unk> said
<unk> help would make it possible for <unk> to build a wider range of cars
an executive model would significantly boost <unk> yearly output of <unk> cars
you are talking about a couple hundred thousand a year said <unk> <unk> an auto - industry analyst at <unk> brokerage <unk> <unk> <unk>
a pact with <unk> may emerge in as little as two weeks according to sources close to the talks
the deal would require approval by a majority of <unk> shareholders
we have to make it attractive enough that holders would accept it <unk> <unk> said
that may be difficult the <unk> chairman acknowledged n when you have somebody else breathing down your neck
<unk> probably would try to kill the proposal by enlisting support from <unk> takeover - stock speculators and holding out the carrot of a larger bid later said <unk> <unk> <unk> european auto analyst at <unk> brokers <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> ca n't make a full - fledged bid for <unk> until <unk> government restrictions expire
the anti - takeover measure prevents any outside investor from buying more than <unk> of <unk> shares without permission until <unk> n <unk>
but with its <unk> stake <unk> can convene a special <unk> shareholders meeting and urge them to drop the restrictions prematurely
it a very valuable weapon in their armory which could enable <unk> to bid sooner for <unk> observed <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
otherwise <unk> may have to tolerate the two <unk> auto giants each owning a <unk> stake for more than a year
it would be difficult to see how a car company can be owned by a collective <unk> <unk> said
it has never been done before but there always a first
although two <unk> bells showed strong growth in access lines usage and unregulated business revenue one reported a modest gain in third - quarter net while the other posted a small drop
<unk> <unk> earnings increased n after strong revenue gains were offset somewhat by refunds and rate reductions imposed by regulators in its midwest territory

the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> consists of two separate door - to-door nationwide polls conducted for the <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> associates and the <unk> <unk>
the two surveys which asked different questions were conducted using national random probability samples
the poll conducted by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> interviewed <unk> adults age n and older from <unk> n to <unk> <unk> <unk>
the poll conducted by the <unk> <unk> interviewed <unk> adults age n and older from <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>
responses were weighted on the basis of age and gender to conform with <unk> <unk> data
for each poll the odds are n out of <unk> that if pollsters had sought to survey every household in the <unk> using the same questionnaire the findings would differ from these poll results by no more than <unk> <unk> percentage points in either direction
the margin of error for subgroups for example married women with children at home would be larger
in addition in any survey there is always the chance that other factors such as question wording could introduce errors into the findings
program traders were buying and selling at full steam <unk> the first trading session after the stock market n plunge <unk>
they accounted for a hefty n of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> volume <unk> the fourth busiest session ever
on <unk> <unk> of volume was in computer - guided program trades
in <unk> by contrast program trading averaged <unk> of daily <unk> <unk> turnover
program traders were publicly castigated following the <unk> crash <unk> <unk> <unk> and a number of brokerage firms pulled back from using this strategy for a while
but as the outcry faded by the spring of <unk> they resumed
some observers thought that after <unk> sharp drop the firms would rein in their program traders to avoid stoking more controversy
but the statistics released yesterday show n the firms did nothing of the sort
one reason they said <unk> was that the official reports on the <unk> crash exonerated program trading as a cause
stock - index arbitrage is the most controversial form of program trading because it accelerates market moves if not actually causing them
in it traders buy or sell stocks and offset those positions in stock - index futures contracts to profit from fleeting price discrepancies
under the exchange definitions program trading also describes a number of other strategies that in the opinion of some traders do n't cause big swings in the market
the <unk> <unk> disclosure of program trading activity on these two days was unusual
though it collects such data daily its monthly reports on program trading usually come out about three weeks after each month ends
the <unk> figures are due to be released this week
the <unk> <unk> declined to name the <unk> <unk> firms involved in the activity <unk> and <unk> or the type of strategies used
but traders on the exchange floor who can observe the computer - guided trading activity on monitor screens said n most of the top program - trading firms were active both days
through <unk> the top five program trading firms in volume were <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
though brokerage officials defended their use of program trading one sign of what an issue it remains was that few executives would comment on the record
besides reciting the pardon for program trading contained in the <unk> <unk> report they said n stock - index arbitrage was actually needed <unk> to restore the markets equilibrium
on <unk> the stock - index futures market was unhinged from the stock market when the <unk> <unk> <unk> halted trading in <unk> <unk> <unk> futures contract a circuit breaker procedure instituted after the <unk> crash and implemented for the first time
futures trading resumed a half - hour later but the session ended shortly thereafter leaving the stock market set up for more sell programs traders said n
by <unk> morning they said n stock - index arbitrage sell programs helped re - establish the link between stocks and futures
but stunning volatility was produced in the process
the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> plunged a breathtaking n points in the first n minutes of trading <unk> as stock - index arbitrage sell programs kicked in
at about n a.m. <unk> the market abruptly turned upward on stock - index arbitrage buy programs
by day end the <unk> industrials had rebounded <unk> points or nearly half of <unk> drop
frederick of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> its board voted a <unk> increase in the specialty boutique - store operator semiannual dividend to five cents a common share
the dividend is payable <unk> n to stock of record <unk> n
<unk> <unk> <unk> reported a third - quarter net loss of n million or <unk> a share and suspended its quarterly dividend because of potential losses on its <unk> real estate holdings
the <unk> - based holding company for <unk> largest bank said <unk> it added n million to its allowance for losses on loans and for real estate owned
the company earned n million or n cents a share a year earlier
for the nine months <unk> <unk> posted a net loss of n million or <unk> a share
it had profit of n million or <unk> a share in the n period
<unk> <unk> had been paying a quarterly dividend of <unk> cents a share
the <unk> real estate market continues to be depressed and there is still uncertainty as to when values will recover <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman said
the decision to increase the loan - loss reserve and suspend the dividend is both prudent and in the best long - term interest of the shareholders he said n
<unk> <unk> said <unk> it made the decision on the basis of an overall assessment of the marketplace and the condition of its loan portfolio and after reviewing it with federal regulators
the addition to reserves comes on top of a provision of n million that was announced in <unk>
in <unk> <unk> downgraded n million of the company debt saying n the bank holding company had n't taken adequate write - offs against potential losses on real estate loans despite its second - quarter write - down
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> executive vice president said then that the company believed n the write - downs were adequate and did n't plan to increase its reserves again
<unk> <unk> a banking analyst with <unk> <unk> a <unk> brokerage firm said <unk> <unk> <unk> is n't out of the woods yet
the key will be whether <unk> real estate turns around or at least stabilizes he said n
they stepped up to the plate to take the write - downs but when markets head down a company is always exposed to further negative surprises <unk> <unk> said
<unk> <unk> closed yesterday at <unk> a share down n in national over - the-counter trading
two years of coddling down the drain
that the way n a lot of brokers feel today on the second anniversary of the <unk> stock - market crash
ever since that fearful <unk> <unk> they been tirelessly wooing wary individual investors trying to convince them that <unk> n <unk> was a fluke and that the stock market really is a safe place <unk> for average americans to put their hard - earned dollars
and until last <unk> it seemed n those efforts were starting to pay off
some of those folks were coming back says <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman of discount brokers <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
we had heard from people who had n't been active for a long time
then came the frightening n plunge in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and a new wave of stock - market volatility
all of a sudden it was back to square one
it going to set things back for a period because it reinforces the concern of volatility says <unk> <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
i think n it will shake confidence one more time and a lot of this business is based on client confidence
brokers around the country say n the reaction from individual investors this week has been almost eerie
customers and potential customers are suddenly complaining about the stock market in the exact way n they did in post - crash n
the kinds of questions <unk> you had before have resurfaced says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman of regional brokerage firm <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
i can just tell <unk> the questions are right back where they were what going on ca n't anything be done about program trading does n't the exchange understand where is the <unk> on this
<unk> <unk> says <unk> he convinced n the public still wants to invest in common stocks even though they believe <unk> the deck is stacked against them
but these wide swings scare them to death
all of this is bad news for the big brokerage firms such as <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> that have big retail or individual - investor businesses
after expanding rapidly during the bull - market years up to the <unk> crash retail brokerage operations these days are getting barely enough business to pay the overhead
true the amount of money n investors are willing to entrust to their brokers has been growing lately
but those dollars have been going into such safe products as money market funds which do n't generate much in the way of commissions for the brokerage firms
at discount brokerage <unk> <unk> <unk> such cash - equivalent investments recently accounted for a record n billion of the firm <unk> billion of client assets
the brokers hope has been that they could soon coax investors into shifting some of their hoard into the stock market
and before last <unk> they were actually making modest progress
a slightly higher percentage of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> volume has been attributed to retail investors in recent months compared with post - crash n according to securities <unk> <unk> data
in <unk> an average n of <unk> <unk> volume was retail business with the monthly level never more than n
the retail participation dropped to an average n in <unk> and shriveled to barely n some months during the year
yet in <unk> retail participation has been more than <unk> in every month and was <unk> in <unk> the latest month for which figures are available
<unk> <unk> the <unk> research director says that all of his group retail - volume statistics could be overstated by as much as five percentage points because corporate buy - backs are sometimes inadvertently included in <unk> <unk> data
but there did seem to be a retail activity pickup
but <unk> did n't help things says <unk> <unk> <unk>
with the gyrations of recent days says <unk> <unk> <unk> senior vice president at <unk> <unk> many small investors are absolutely convinced that they should n't play in the stock market
<unk> <unk> president of retail sales and marketing at <unk> <unk> <unk> still thinks that individual investors will eventually go back into the stock market
investors will develop thicker skins and their confidence will return he says n
<unk> plunge he is telling <unk> brokers <unk> was nothing more than a tremendous reaction to leveraged buy - out stocks
meanwhile <unk> remains among the leaders in efforts to simply persuade investors to keep giving <unk> <unk> their money
it more of an important issue to keep control of those assets rather than push the investor to move into specific products such as equities <unk> <unk> says
the equity decision will come when the client is ready and when there a semblance of confidence
it could be a long wait say n some industry observers
some investors will tiptoe back in says <unk> <unk> a market research director for <unk> <unk> in <unk>
then there be another swing
given enough of these this will drive everyone out except the most hardy he adds
<unk> <unk> who has been studying retail investors perception of risks in the brokerage industry said n a market plunge like <unk> shatters investors confidence in their ability to make any judgments on the market
the long - term outlook for the retail brokerage business is miserable <unk> <unk> declares <unk>

<unk> <unk> <unk> an investment - newsletter publisher and three venture - capital firms n he organized were enjoined from violating the registration provisions of the securities laws governing investment companies

in <unk> in another consent agreement with the <unk> <unk> <unk> was enjoined from violating the stock - registration and anti - fraud provisions of the securities laws
without any admission or denial of guilt by <unk> <unk> that agreement settled <unk> charges that <unk> <unk> sold unregistered securities and misled investors
in charges filed last week in federal district court in <unk> <unk> the <unk> alleged that <unk> capitalists <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of <unk> failed repeatedly to file proper documents
the <unk> also charged that <unk> <unk> acted as an officer or director of <unk> <unk> in violation of his previous consent agreement
some companies were delinquent in filings and other actions all of which cost money <unk> <unk> said
two of <unk> <unk> business associates who worked for <unk> capitalists <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> also consented to being enjoined from violations of registration provisions of the securities laws

in consenting to the injunctions none of the individuals or companies admitted or denied the allegations
<unk> republicans have settled on a proposal that would cut the capital - gains tax for individuals and corporations
at the same time a small group of <unk> democrats are working on a similar plan and may introduce it soon
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the lead sponsor of the <unk> proposal said <unk> he intends to unveil the plan today and to offer it as an amendment to whatever legislation comes along particularly this month bill <unk> to raise the federal borrowing limit
he gave <unk> odds that a capital - gains tax cut of some sort would be approved this year though it probably wo n't be included in the pending deficit - reduction bill
he added that he expects to talk to the democrats who also wanted to cut the gains tax about drafting a joint proposal
for individuals the <unk> plan would exclude from income n of the gain from the sale of a capital asset held for more than one year
the exclusion would rise five percentage points for each year n the asset was held until it reached a maximum of <unk>
the exclusion would apply to assets sold after <unk> n <unk>
as an alternative he said n taxpayers could chose to reduce their gains by an inflation index
for corporations the top tax rate on the sale of assets held for more than three years would be cut to <unk> from the current top rate of n
that rate would gradually decline to as little as <unk> for corporate assets held for n years
the <unk> plan would also include a proposal designed by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that would expand and alter the deduction for individual retirement accounts
the <unk> plan would create a new non - deductible <unk> from which money could be withdrawn tax - free not only for retirement but also for the purchase of a first home and to pay education and medical expenses
current iras could be rolled over into the new iras but would be subject to tax
for their part the group of democrats are working on a plan that like the <unk> proposal would grant larger exclusions to assets the longer n they were held by individuals and companies
newly acquired assets would get a bigger break than those currently held
an extra exclusion would be given to long - held stock in small and medium - size corporations just starting up
no one in the <unk> is considering the capital - gains plan passed by the <unk>
that plan would provide a n exclusion to assets sold over a <unk> <unk> period ending <unk> <unk> <unk>
after then the <unk> measure would boost the tax rate to n and exclude from tax the gain attributable to inflation
senators are focusing on making a capital - gains differential permanent
separately <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> ways and means <unk> said <unk> he did n't want the capital - gains tax cut or any other amendments attached to the pending bill raising the federal borrowing limit
the current debt limit expires <unk> n
he also urged <unk> and <unk> negotiators to rid the deficit - reduction bill of all provisions that increase the budget deficit including the <unk> - passed capital - gains provision
from a helicopter a thousand feet above <unk> after the second - deadliest earthquake in <unk> history a scene of devastation emerges a freeway crumbled into a concrete sandwich hoses pumping water into once - fashionable apartments abandoned autos
but this quake was n't the big one the replay of n that has been feared for so many years
despite the tragic loss of more than <unk> lives and damage estimated in the billions most businesses and their plants and offices in the <unk> area were n't greatly affected
the economic life of the region is expected to revive in a day or two although some transportation problems may last weeks or months
a main factor mitigating more widespread damage was the location of the quake epicenter <unk> miles from the heart of the <unk> <unk> and more than <unk> miles from downtown <unk> <unk> and <unk>
also the region insistence on strict building codes helped prevent wider damage
the tremendous energy of the quake was dissipated by the distance so that most parts of the valley and the major cities suffered largely cosmetic damage broken windows falling brick and cornices buckled asphalt or sidewalks
of course the quake was the worst since the emergence of the computer era turned <unk> <unk> into the nation capital of high technology
like other major american cities the <unk> <unk> <unk> area owes its current prosperity more to its infrastructure of fiber - optic cables linking thousands of computer terminals and telephones than to its location astride one of the world great natural harbors
when the tremors struck the region largely unseen high - tech fabric held up surprisingly well despite the devastation visible from the air
<unk> <unk> <unk> vice president for network technology at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> says <unk> nearly all the network computer switches which move thousands of calls a minute from one location to another changed to battery power when the city lost power
the battery packs have enough power for only three hours but that gave emergency crews time n to turn on an emergency system that runs primarily on diesel fuel
of some n switches in <unk> <unk> network only four went down
one of those was in <unk> <unk> near the earthquake epicenter
few telephone lines snapped
that because the widely used fiber - optic cable has been installed underground with <unk> extra feet of cable between junction points
the slack absorbs the pulling strain generated by an earthquake
nevertheless phone service was sporadic many computer terminals remained dark and by late yesterday a third of <unk> <unk> remained without power
business in the nation fourth - largest metropolitan region was nearly paralyzed an estimated one million members of the work force stayed at home
the economic dislocation was as abrupt as the earthquake itself as virtually all businesses shut down
the <unk> <unk> area economy represents one - fourth of the economy of the nation most populous state and accounts for <unk> to n of the nation total output of goods and services according to the <unk> for <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
in high - tech the <unk> area accounts for <unk> to n of the <unk> computer - related industry
this has been a major disruption for the <unk> area economy says <unk> <unk> the chief economist at the <unk> <unk> of <unk>
obviously things are going to have to go on hold for many companies
the damage to the <unk> area roadways could cause significant economic hardship
a quarter of a million people cross the <unk> <unk> every day far more than the n that use the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> system <unk> which was working but was n't stopping in the city <unk> <unk> yesterday afternoon because electricity was shut off and the area was being checked for gas leaks
<unk> state transportation officials interviewed by telephone say n they nevertheless do n't expect serious problems for commerce in and out of the <unk> area
all major roadways except <unk> <unk> known as the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> were open by <unk> p.m. yesterday
officials expect difficulty routing traffic through downtown <unk> <unk>
the earthquake caused many streets to buckle and crack making them impassible
other roads were obstructed by collapsed buildings and damaged water and power lines an emergency relief spokesman says n
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> estimated the damage to his city alone at n billion
but many predicted that the commercial disruption would be short - lived
of the scores of companies contacted by this newspaper few reported any damage that they did n't expect to have remedied within a day or two
it is possible of course that some of the most seriously damaged companies could n't be reached particularly in areas nearest the epicenter
typical perhaps was the situation at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> motors <unk> joint - venture auto plant in <unk> about <unk> miles south of <unk>
ten of the plant workers were injured when the quake hit about a half - hour into the afternoon shift seven were hospitalized
metal racks on the plant floor fell over and water mains ruptured a spokeswoman says n
the plant was evacuated and workers sent home
but the plant was able to resume limited production of its <unk> corollas and <unk> <unk> by n a.m. yesterday and absenteeism was only n of the work force about twice normal
computer maker <unk> - <unk> <unk> based in <unk> <unk> says <unk> one of its buildings sustained severe damage when it was knocked off its foundation
other buildings had broken glass dangling light fixtures and broken pipes a spokesperson says n estimating the cost of reconstruction in the millions
most banks were closed but were expected to reopen today with few problems anticipated
at the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> says n operations were steaming along as usual yesterday afternoon
when the quake hit we turned on our emergency generator and brought our computers up he says
the <unk> serves as a middleman for banks taking checks from one bank and sending them to another an operation that it handled smoothly <unk> night after the quake
the volume n we received from the banks was a lot lower than usual he says
a disaster - contingency plan in which the <unk> <unk> <unk> would come to <unk> <unk> aid was n't needed he adds n
most of the telephone problems in the immediate aftermath stemmed from congestion
the telephone network simply could n't handle the large number of people seeking to make a call at the same time
the volume resulted in dial - tone delays that were as short as <unk> seconds and as long as five minutes
<unk> <unk> puts traffic volume at <unk> to <unk> times normal
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> communications <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> unit were blocking phone calls into the <unk> area to alleviate congestion
the companies block traffic much as highway on - ramps are blocked when traffic backs up
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> vice president of customer services for the <unk> area says n most long - distance companies were blocking about <unk> of all calls
<unk> <unk> says <unk> its <unk> <unk> unit also was blocking about <unk> of its calls locally
ironically the long - term effect of the earthquake may be to bolster the <unk> area economic fortunes and indeed the nation gross national product
it may also lead to new safeguards in major construction projects such as double - deck highways
it would in the near - term give a boost to the <unk> <unk> economy because there will be an influx of people n to help says <unk> <unk> <unk> a regional economist at <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> forecasting firm
the construction industry is sure to feel increased demand
there will be a big influx of federal dollars and gains in state federal and local employment <unk> <unk> says
adds <unk> <unk> an economist at <unk> <unk> <unk> there nothing positive about an earthquake but it will probably generate more construction activity
<unk> <unk> reacted swiftly yesterday to the disaster by bidding up stocks of construction and related companies
shares of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a cement maker rose sharply in anticipation of stepped - up demand
in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> spokesman <unk> <unk> says <unk> obviously with an earthquake of this size there are likely to be construction projects that would n't otherwise have been anticipated
but any increase is n't likely to be any kind of a surge
it something likely to be spread out over a long period of time
there will be a lot of repair work that wo n't require the quantities of cement or concrete that new constructon would
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> facilities were n't damaged in the quake
the earthquake is likely to reduce <unk> negligibly in the near term and then could raise it a bit as rebuilding begins
the first effects are of course negative as work is disrupted and people lose income and cut spending
corporate profits may also dip initially
many of the lost tourism dollars wo n't be recovered many trips delayed never take place
subsequently however the ill effects are likely to be offset at least in economic terms as construction activity begins
because of the way n the government keeps its books the damage to the <unk> <unk> however costly wo n't be counted as a minus
the money spent on repairs will be counted as a plus
it very difficult to model the long - term impact of this says <unk> <unk> who studies the public - policy and crisis - management aspects of earthquakes at the <unk> for <unk> <unk> studies in <unk> <unk>
you certainly can say n it going to be extremely severe
we really are talking about shutting down a major american city for a number of days maybe for a few weeks
<unk> <unk> says <unk> the cost of the earthquake will definitely top n billion and could reach <unk> billion
he cautions that early damage estimates are often low the damage totals in <unk> <unk> increased tenfold as more information was received
the earthquake damage of course would have been far greater if the epicenter had been in downtown <unk> <unk>
a direct hit on a major city <unk> <unk> figures <unk> would cause n billion to <unk> billion of damage
experts caution that it is far too soon for reliable estimates of the quake total damage but it clear that insurers are likely to pay out enormous sums
<unk> <unk> the chairman of <unk> <unk> <unk> which is based in <unk> <unk> estimates n insured losses resulting the earthquake could total <unk> billion
the impact on the insurance industry will be big and harsh but less than <unk> <unk> says <unk> <unk> <unk> who toured the <unk> area by car yesterday afternoon to get a sense of the company exposure to the earthquake
<unk> <unk> says <unk> <unk> <unk> will probably pay hundreds of millions in primary claims but after taxes and use of its reinsurance lines the company fourthquarter charge against earnings should n't top n million
the company was able to assess its damage liability quickly because it has computerized maps of northern <unk> showing the exact locations of all the property n it insures
<unk> <unk> had claims adjusters on the streets of <unk> <unk> right after sunrise yesterday and was paying as many claims as it could right on the spot
<unk> <unk> insures <unk> homes and autos and n businesses in the <unk> area
in addition to paying for earthquake and fire damage the insurer must cover worker - compensation claims and also losses due to businesses being shut down by lack of power or phone service
but many californians may not have adequate insurance coverage <unk> to pay for damages to their property
the <unk> <unk> agents of <unk> says n fewer than one of every five <unk> homeowners has earthquake insurance
a somewhat higher percentage of people living in the <unk> area have bought the additional insurance protection but the great majority are n't covered
earthquake insurance typically runs n or more a year for a small house
whatever the long - term economic effect the scene from the helicopter above <unk> is one of tragedy
gargantuan sections of a double - decker freeway have been heaved about like plastic building blocks
atop them sit cars and trucks abandoned in a terrifying scramble to safety the day before
in areas where the freeway made giant concrete sandwiches of itself lie cars that police say n have been flattened into foot - thick slabs
on the periphery rescue workers seem from the air to move in slow motion
they peck away at the <unk> <unk> section of rubble searching for more of the <unk> people thought to have died here
about n other deaths were also attributed to the earthquake
the heart of the earthquake <unk> on the <unk> scale was <unk> miles to the south near <unk> <unk> but its terrible fist struck here on the <unk> <unk> a major artery serving the <unk> <unk> between <unk> and <unk> <unk>
along the way the quake toppled a mall in <unk> <unk> knocked down buildings in <unk> <unk> fashionable <unk> <unk> and sent a wall of bricks crashing on motorists in the city <unk> <unk>
just a short span across the bay to the west the quake also showed its mettle a four - square-block area of the <unk> <unk> lies smoldering under a steady stream of seawater being pumped onto rubble to prevent it from blazing anew
many of the buildings mostly condominiums and apartments were flattened almost instantly as the underlying soil much of it landfill was literally turned to ooze by the quake intensive shaking rupturing gas lines
onlookers say n three persons died when one of the buildings exploded into a fireball shortly after the quake struck
efforts to fight the blaze were hampered because water mains were severed as well
from the air ribbons of yellow fire hose carry water from the bay to high - pressure nozzles trained on the site
as onlookers stand behind barricades helmeted firemen and building inspectors survey rows of nearby buildings that were twisted from their foundations and seem on the verge of collapse

called patients in the <unk> the program features fact sheets designed to be easy n to understand
the sheets tell how the medicine works describe how to use it and list its possible side effects
they are designed to be given to patients by their doctors when the medicines are prescribed and include space n for the doctor to write special instructions
in addition <unk> will give pharmacists brochures on the use of prescription drugs for distribution in their stores
consumer groups have long advocated that drug companies and doctors make more information available to patients
we believe that every drug that marketed to a consumer should have a consumer label said <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> affiliate
<unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> is the only company n i know that voluntarily will make consumer information available
according to federal officials and drug - industry studies nearly half of the n billion prescriptions filled each year are n't used properly meaning that money is wasted on some prescriptions and patients are deprived of the benefits of medication
we think n it very important to provide as much information as possible on the drugs n consumers take said <unk> chairman <unk> <unk>
bond prices rambled yesterday as investors kept close watch on the stock market and worried about a wave of new supply
early yesterday bonds rose as investors rushed to buy <unk> securities on the prospect that stocks would plummet in the aftermath of the massive <unk> earthquake
for example some securities analysts warned that stocks of certain insurance companies which face massive damage claims would get hit hard
but when the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> rose instead bonds drifted lower
with stocks not a major focus we waiting for the next guiding light said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> chief economist at <unk> <unk> securities <unk>
if the stock market tremors are behind us then the bond market will go back to looking at the next batch of economic numbers to determine where interest rates are heading
the <unk> benchmark <unk> bond which jumped n point or about n for each <unk> face amount during the first hour of trading ended little changed

<unk> a unit of <unk> <unk> <unk> slashed the size of its note offering from n million to n million
the move had been widely expected
in the multipart offering the company sold a portion of secured notes but shelved all the unsecured notes
a <unk> spokeswoman said <unk> the notes may be offered at a later date
this was not a do - or-die deal she said
i think n this is a market that required some level of security
it did not make sense to offer unsecured paper in an unsettling market
investors have been speculating for weeks about the market ability to place the n billion to <unk> billion of new junk bonds scheduled to be sold by year end
supply troubles were also on the minds of <unk> investors yesterday who worried about the flood of new government securities coming next week
we being bombarded by new <unk> and agency debt offerings said <unk> <unk> <unk> director of money - market research at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>

in the municipal market all eyes were on <unk> debt as investors tried to gauge the financial ramifications of <unk> earthquake
but traders said n the quake had only a minor impact on the trading of <unk> state and local municipal debt
there are certain bonds n traders refer to as earthquake bonds because the issuers are on top of the <unk> <unk> fault said <unk> <unk> editor of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a newsletter for investors
since those bonds already pay a slightly higher yield an extra premium for the earthquake risk they were n't materially affected
but some bond market analysts said <unk> that could quickly change if property casualty insurance companies scramble to sell portions of their municipal portfolios to raise cash n to pay damage claims
insurance companies will foot a substantial amount of the bill to reconstruct <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> chief economist at manufacturers <unk> securities <unk>
he also expects the performance of municipals to lag treasurys as <unk> is forced to issue new debt over time to repair public facilities

the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> two dominant issuers of mortgage securities have a sizable amount of <unk> home loans in their mortgagebacked pools
but their potential quake exposure is seen as small given that they require a financial cushion on all the loans n they purchase

the <unk> <unk> still stands
but the man who built it has fallen
<unk> <unk> yesterday removed <unk> <unk> one of the staunchest holdouts against the reform rumbling through the communist world in an effort to win back the confidence of its increasingly rebellious citizens
but while it was a move that stunned the <unk> bloc it hardly ushers in an era of reform at least anytime soon
for the <unk> replaced <unk> <unk> who had led <unk> <unk> for n years and before that headed its security apparatus with a man cut of the same cloth <unk> <unk> the most recent internal - security chief and a longtime <unk> protege
<unk> <unk> it is clear <unk> is no <unk> where the <unk> <unk> now shares power with the democratically elected <unk> union
nor is it a <unk> where yesterday the parliament approved constitutional changes meant to help turn the communist nation into a multiparty democracy
still any change in <unk> <unk> has enormous implications for both <unk> and <unk>
it raises the long - cherished hopes of many germans for reunification a prospect that almost equally alarms political leaders in <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> was named the new party chief just minutes after the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> convened in <unk> <unk>
although the east german news agency <unk> claimed <unk> <unk> <unk> had asked to be relieved of his duties for health reasons west german government sources said <unk> the <unk> <unk> had asked for his resignation at a separate meeting late <unk>
<unk> <unk> was twice hospitalized this summer for a gall bladder ailment and his physical condition has been the subject of intense speculation in the western media
<unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> a hard - line <unk> who in <unk> supervised the construction of the <unk> <unk> also was relieved of his title as head of state and his position as chief of the military
<unk> <unk> is expected to be formally named to all three positions once the nation parliament convenes later this week
<unk> <unk> ignoble fall culminates nearly two decades of iron - handed leadership during which <unk> <unk> now n years old built <unk> <unk> into the most economically advanced nation in the <unk> bloc
his grip on power unraveled this summer as thousands of his countrymen dissatisfied by the harshness of his rule fled to the <unk>
thousands more have taken to the streets in the last month in <unk> <unk> largest wave of domestic unrest since a workers uprising in <unk>
in <unk> the <unk> administration took a characteristically cautious and skeptical view of the leadership change
the official line was to offer warmer ties to <unk> <unk> provided n he is willing to institute reforms
but <unk> officials have strong doubts that he is a reformer
<unk> <unk> told reporters whether that the leadership change reflects a change in <unk> - <unk> relations i do n't think so
because <unk> <unk> has been very much in accord with the policies of <unk>
one top <unk> expert on <unk> <unk> added there is no clear - cut champion of reform that we know of in the east german leadership
indeed <unk> <unk> said on east german television last night that there will be no sharing of power with pro - democracy groups
he said n while dialogue is important enough forums already exist in which different interests can express themselves
the removal of <unk> <unk> was apparently the result of bitter infighting within the top ranks of the communist party
according to west german government sources <unk> <unk> and several senior <unk> members fought over the last week to delay any decisions about a leadership change
but with public demonstrations in the country growing in size and intensity <unk> <unk> and several key allies lost out in this battle officials say n
those allies included <unk> members <unk> <unk> who has long headed economic affairs and <unk> <unk> chief of information policy
both men were also relieved of their duties yesterday
although other resignations may follow it still not clear to what extent the change in party personnel will alter the government resistance to fundamental change
clearly the central figure in this process is <unk> <unk>
born in <unk> in a <unk> <unk> town now part of <unk> he was eight years old when <unk> <unk> <unk> ended
like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> he represents the postwar generation that has grown up during <unk> division
since joining the <unk> in <unk> as its youngest member <unk> <unk> had acquired the nickname crown prince a reference to the widely held view that he was the hand - picked successor to <unk> <unk>
in fact the two men have had strikingly similar career paths both having served as chief of internal security before their rise to the top party position
moreover both men have hewn to a similar hard - line philosophy
notably one of <unk> <unk> few official visits overseas came a few months ago when he visited <unk> after the massacre in <unk>
he later defended the chinese government response during a separate visit to <unk> <unk>
east german <unk> in particular fears <unk> <unk> in part because of an incident in <unk> n when he was believed to have ordered the arrest of hundreds of dissidents who had sought refuge in the <unk>
however <unk> <unk> also has a reputation for being politically savvy
his shrewd ability to read the shifting popular mood in <unk> <unk> is best illustrated by his apparent break with his old mentor <unk> <unk>
indeed according to west german government sources he was one of the leaders in the power struggle that toppled <unk> <unk>
in recent days <unk> <unk> has sought to project a kinder image
according to a report widely circulating in <unk> <unk> it was <unk> <unk> who ordered police to stop using excessive force against demonstrators in <unk>
he does n't want to have the image of the gun man says <unk> <unk> an expert at the <unk> - sponsored <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> studies in <unk>
he not a reformer he wants to have the image of a reformer
as part of his image polishing <unk> <unk> is expected to take modest steps toward reform to rebuild confidence among the people and reassert the party authority
besides sacking other senior <unk> officials who allied themselves with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> could loosen controls on the news media free up travel restrictions and establish a dialogue with various dissident groups
but will it be enough
west german government officials and western analysts are doubtful
he does n't signify what people want so the unrest will go on <unk> <unk> predicts
at the same time the expectations of the east german people are great and will continue to grow
says one west german official what necessary now is the process of democratization
not just that people are being heard but that their interests are being taken seriously
<unk> <unk> meanwhile has invited <unk> <unk> to open discussions with <unk> on a wide range of subjects
reports in the west german press citing sources in <unk> <unk> suggest <unk> <unk> <unk> may serve only as a bridge between <unk> <unk> and a genuine reform leader
adding to that speculation is <unk> <unk> reputation as a heavy drinker who is said to also suffer from diabetes
this is a dynamic process and we experiencing the first step the <unk> official adds
the selection of <unk> <unk> may also disappoint <unk>
soviet leader <unk> <unk> has pressed hard for a change in <unk> <unk> rigid stance
two reform - minded party leaders favored by <unk> as possible successors to <unk> <unk> <unk> party secretary <unk> <unk> and <unk> member <unk> <unk> were passed over
if <unk> <unk> sticks to rigid policies the pressure from the <unk> <unk> could intensify
in <unk> <unk> <unk> sent <unk> <unk> a congratulatory telegram that appeared to urge the new leadership to heed growing calls for change
according to the soviet news agency <unk> <unk> expressed the conviction that the leadership of the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> being sensitive to the demands of the time will find solutions to complicated problems n the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> encountered
a force of younger pro - <unk> members in the east german bureaucracy has for some time been pushing for relaxation within their country
the older generation has been torn between a fear of tampering with the status quo and a fear of what might happen if they did n't
from the perspective of <unk> <unk> old guard reforms that smack of capitalism and western - style democracy could eliminate their country reason for being
unlike the other nations of the <unk> <unk> <unk> is a creature of the <unk> <unk>
erasing the differences still dividing <unk> and the vast international reordering n that implies wo n't endanger the statehood of a <unk> or a <unk>
but it could ultimately lead to german reunification and the disappearance of <unk> <unk> from the map
which is what the <unk> <unk> fears
i sure n they formulate a reform that will be a recipe for the <unk> future as a separately identifiable state says <unk> <unk> a british journalist whose book on <unk> <unk> entitled the <unk> <unk> was published this month
up to now that recipe has consisted of a dogged effort by former leader <unk> <unk> to establish the country international legitimacy followed by <unk> <unk> campaign to build the <unk> <unk> only successful stalinist economy into a consumer paradise
neither man achieved perfection
early in <unk> <unk> <unk> and his team stopped paying thin compliments to <unk> <unk> and joined with <unk> in rejecting any necessity for adjustments in their systems
the less - self-confident czechoslovaks and bulgarians in contrast declared their intentions to reform while doing nothing concrete about it
the east german media soon began presenting <unk> <unk> speeches only as sketchy summaries and giving space to his opponents
by late n they were banning soviet publications
the country abandoned its former devotion to socialist unity and took to insisting instead that each country in the bloc ought to travel its own road
<unk> <unk> spoke of generally valid objective laws of socialism and left no room for debate
with this year dislocations in <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the drive to democracy in <unk> and <unk> the east german leadership grew still more defensive
<unk> member <unk> <unk> confessed to a grave concern over hungarian democracy
under the banner that proclaims the renewal of socialism he said forces are at work that are striving to eliminate socialism
some loyal voices in and out of the east <unk> <unk> party saw the nation unrest coming
the first signs were economic
despite heavily subsidized consumer industries east germans have for years watched the <unk> pull farther out ahead
in <unk> for the first time economic growth came to a dead stop
gingerly some economists began to blame central planning
some writers in theoretical journals even raised the notion of introducing democracy at least in the workplace
by summer an independent reform movement was saying out loud what it had only whispered before
but they are stalwart socialists
their proclaimed purpose is to cleanse <unk> <unk> of its stalinist muck not to merge with the <unk>
one of their pastors has envisioned a new utopia of creative socialism
meanwhile the man <unk> <unk> <unk> replaces has left an indelible mark on east german society
imprisoned by the nazis during <unk> <unk> <unk> for his political beliefs <unk> <unk> typified the postwar generation of committed communist leaders in <unk> <unk> who took their cues from <unk>
he was a socialist warrior who felt rankled by <unk> <unk> enormous postwar prosperity and the <unk> government steadfast refusal to recognize the legitimacy of his state
finally during his first and only state visit to <unk> two years ago he won some measure of the recognition n he had long sought
but ultimately he was undone by forces unleashed by his own comrade <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> removal was bound to happen says one aide to <unk> <unk>

it does n't make sense to parachute out at this price <unk> <unk> says though he has stopped his takeover talk and now commends <unk> managers operating skills
at the current price the <unk> holding represents <unk> of all the assets that <unk> <unk> manages
a week ago <unk> stock briefly soared above n after a report in <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> might launch a hostile bid for the carrier though takeover speculators say n they were skeptical
if <unk> is worth <unk> as a takeover and the stock went to <unk> the market was saying <unk> <unk> presence was n't worth anything in terms of getting a deal done says a veteran takeover speculator
traders say n this all goes to show that even the smartest money manager can get infected with crowd passions
in trying to raid <unk> <unk> <unk> abandoned his usual role as a passive investor and ran into snags
moreover unlike <unk> <unk> who often holds big stakes in companies for years <unk> <unk> has n't in the past done much long - term investing
<unk> <unk> who runs about <unk> billion for <unk> partners made his name as a gunslinging trader moving in and out of stocks with agility enriching himself and his investment clients
meanwhile his big losses for instance in <unk> crash generally have been trading losses
so some see a special irony in the fact that <unk> <unk> the trader now is encumbered with a massive illiquid airline holding
analysts say <unk> <unk> stock might lose four or five points if the <unk> stake was dumped all at once
as a result <unk> <unk> must reconcile himself to selling <unk> at a loss or to holding the shares as an old - fashioned investment
long - term investing that not steinhardt style chuckles an investor who once worked at <unk> partners
he does n't usually risk that much unless he thinks <unk> he has an ace in the hole adds another <unk> partners alumnus
in recent days traders say <unk> <unk> has been buying its own shares as part of a program to retire about eight million <unk> shares though the carrier wo n't discuss its buy - back program
if <unk> stepped up its share purchases that might be a way n for <unk> <unk> to get out says <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> analyst
but <unk> might not want to help <unk> <unk> he adds n
in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> stonewalled when <unk> <unk> airlines <unk> <unk> <unk> threatened to take over the carrier
<unk> <unk> a much more practiced raider than <unk> <unk> eventually sold a big <unk> stake at a tiny profit through <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> also could take that route
he confers big trading commissions on <unk> <unk> firms
however with airline stocks cratering he might not get a very good price for his shares traders say n
especially galling for <unk> <unk> say n people close to him is that <unk> <unk> <unk> wo n't even take his telephone calls
while <unk> is n't considered absolutely takeover - proof its defenses including the sale in <unk> of a <unk> stake in the company to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are pretty strong
<unk> deal with <unk> <unk> was n't exactly a shining example of shareholder democracy <unk> <unk> says <unk>
since last <unk> the investor has made seven so - called n filings in <unk> as he bought and sold the company stock
such disclosures of big holdings often are used by raiders to try to scare a company managers and to stir interest in the stock
but of course it would be highly unusual for an investment fund such as <unk> partners to take over a company
<unk> and <unk> <unk> wo n't talk about <unk> <unk> at all
analysts say <unk> <unk> has great promise
by the second half of <unk> <unk> stock could hit <unk> says <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>
she thinks n traders should buy the stock if it tumbles to <unk>
but meanwhile <unk> is expected to show losses or lackluster profit for several quarters as it tries to digest <unk> airlines which it acquired
moreover some investors think n a recession or renewed airfare wars will pummel airline stocks in coming months
however <unk> <unk> says <unk> he comfortable holding <unk> as an investment
while he has bought and sold some <unk> shares in recent days he says that contrary to rumors he has n't tried to unload his holding
<unk> <unk> adds that he bought <unk> stock earlier this year as part of a fundamental investment in the airline group
in <unk> <unk> <unk> says <unk> he made money trading in <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
overall his investments so far this year are showing gains of about <unk> he adds n
does <unk> <unk> regret his incursion into the takeover - threat game
people close to the investor say <unk> that was an experiment n he is unlikely to repeat
i do n't think n you find n i making a radical change in my traditional investment style <unk> <unk> says
<unk> resources <unk> said n it called for redemption on <unk> n its n million outstanding of <unk> convertible subordinated debentures due n
the debentures were issued in the face amount of n million on <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> coal mining water transportation and construction company said n
the company said <unk> the redemption is permitted because the price of <unk> stock has equaled or exceeded <unk> for n consecutive trading days a condition set in the terms of the debentures
debenture holders are expected to convert most of the debentures into common because the value of the stock received in a conversion would exceed the <unk> redemption price
<unk> <unk> <unk> said n it will report a loss for the first quarter ended <unk> n because sales of personal computers for the home market remained weak in some major countries
that will mark the second consecutive quarterly loss for <unk> and will raise additional questions about whether it can sustain the turnaround <unk> it had seemed to be engineering
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> had said in <unk> that it was consolidating manufacturing to cut costs and expected to be profitable in the fiscal first quarter
<unk> said that its announcement is based on preliminary information and that the situation could look different by the time n final results are announced early next month
in fact <unk> fiscal fourth - quarter loss was n million narrower than <unk> had expected a few weeks after the quarter closed
still even results approaching break - even would mark a sharp weakening compared with fiscal <unk> first - quarter earnings of n million or n cents a share on sales of n million
reflecting concerns about <unk> outlook its stock has plunged more than <unk> since <unk> closing yesterday unchanged at <unk> a share in composite trading on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the price can be expected to erode further because the loss estimate came after the market closed
<unk> has seemed to be setting the stage recently for progress in the <unk> where its personal - computer sales have been so dismal for years that <unk> is close to dropping off research firms market - share charts
<unk> has assembled an experienced management team it has persuaded many more dealers to carry its products and it has unleashed a slick advertising campaign
but those represent long - term strategies that probably wo n't succeed quickly even if they turn out to be the right ones
in the meantime the strategies will increase expenses
<unk> had been counting on its consumer business to stay sufficiently healthy to support its efforts in other areas mainly in getting schools and businesses to use its <unk> which has slick graphics yet has been slow to catch on because it is n't compatible with <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> machines <unk> hardware
but sales to consumers have become difficult during the past several months even in <unk> <unk> which has been by far <unk> strongest market
the <unk> <unk> and <unk> mainly used for children educational software and games had surprised market researchers by continuing to produce strong sales even though other low - profit personal computers now operate several times as fast and have much more memory
<unk> has said n it expects sales to rebound but market researchers have said that sales of the low - end products may finally be trailing off
stock prices closed slightly higher in the first routine trading day since <unk> big plunge
some issues were affected by <unk> devastating earthquake in the <unk> <unk> area
activity continued to slow from the hectic pace set during the market plunge late <unk> and its rebound <unk> as players began to set their sights on events coming later this week
the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> drifted through the session within a trading range of about <unk> points before closing with a gain of <unk> at n

some n <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> issues advanced in price while <unk> declined
but the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> went down for the seventh consecutive session due largely to further selling in <unk>
the average dropped <unk> to <unk> and has now lost n of its value since the losing streak began <unk> n
<unk> <unk> volume dropped to n shares in line with the level of trading over the past few weeks from n million <unk>
traders cited anticipation of the consumer price report for <unk> due today and tomorrow expiration of <unk> stock - index futures and options as major factors in the slowdown
in addition activity at a number of <unk> <unk> - based brokerage houses was curtailed as a result of the earthquake which knocked out power lines and telephone service throughout the <unk> area
stocks retreated to session lows just after the opening amid worries about the market impact of the quake but quickly snapped back to higher levels with the help of futures - related program buying
the early move essentially established the day trading range and traders said n they saw little of the program activity that has battered the market recently
i did n't expect it to be this quiet
i expected to see more volatility as some of the institutions who were spooked last <unk> did some selling said <unk> <unk> <unk> a market strategist at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> said <unk> he expects prices to show some renewed instability over the next few sessions as institutions re - evaluate their stance toward the market in light of its decline
i would suspect that a lot of investment committees are looking into whether they want to be in stocks at all he said
insurance stocks were sold at the opening amid concerns about the level of damage claims n the companies would receive as a result of the earthquake
but those issues recovered quickly and turned higher because of expectations that the quake and the recent <unk> <unk> would set the stage for an increase in premium rates

<unk> <unk> with circulation near one million and <unk> <unk> with n circulation are legitimate magazine success stories
the magazine <unk> however was for years lackluster and unfocused

could the collapse of <unk> have been prevented
that was the question n structural engineers and <unk> transportation officials were asking themselves yesterday as rescue workers began the gruesome task of trying to extract as many as n victims from beneath the concrete slabs of the double - deck <unk> <unk> in <unk> that caved in during <unk> temblor
after touring the area <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> late yesterday called for an inquiry into the freeway collapse blaming the disaster on substandard construction the <unk> <unk> reported <unk>
the impact of the destruction of this <unk> stretch of highway was tragically measured in lost lives
but there are other long - term effects that raise serious questions about the ability of <unk> infrastructure to withstand a major temblor
it could easily be two years before the well - traveled artery that helps connect <unk> with <unk> <unk> is reopened and the cost to build a new stretch of highway could soar to more than n million said n <unk> <unk> <unk> deputy district director in <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> nicknamed <unk>
<unk> in <unk> said n total damage from the collapsed highway is estimated at around n million
the aftershocks of the highway tragedy are reverberating in <unk> <unk> as well as local politicians spoke yesterday against plans to bring double - decking to <unk> <unk> freeways by n
<unk> plans to add a second deck for buses and car pools above the median of a <unk> stretch of the <unk> <unk> just south of <unk> <unk> near the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> yesterday vowed to fight the introduction of double - decking in the area
caltrans abandoned double - decking in the early n following the <unk> <unk> earthquake that destroyed freeway sections just north of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> explained <unk>
that temblor measured <unk> on the <unk> scale <unk>
so why even consider stacking freeways now
we run out of places n to build freeways in <unk> and the only place <unk> to go is up <unk> <unk> said although he acknowledges n there are many obstacles including cost
but as for safety he says <unk> double - deck freeways built today with the heavily reinforced concrete and thicker columns required after the <unk> quake should withstand a calamitous temblor of <unk> to <unk> on the <unk> scale
reasons for the collapse of the <unk> <unk> were sketchy yesterday
but most structural engineers attributed the destruction to improper reinforcement of the columns that supported the decks and the fact that the ground beneath the highway is largely landfill and can become unstable or liquefy in a major quake
the two - story roadway designed in the <unk> and completed in <unk> was supported by columns that apparently lacked the kind of steel reinforcement used in highways today
while the pillars did have long metal bars running vertically through them for reinforcement they apparently lacked an adequate number of metal ties that run horizontally through the column said <unk> <unk> <unk> a structural engineer in <unk> <unk>
<unk> today uses a variation of the design <unk> <unk> <unk> describes with spiraling steel rods inside
but in the case of the <unk> <unk> the lack of such support caused the core of the columns to crumble and buckle under the weight of the second deck crushing motorists who were lined up in bumper - to-bumper rush - hour traffic on the lower deck nearly n feet below
officials of the state agency did n't have any immediate explanation why the reinforcement did n't hold up
<unk> reinforced the highway in <unk> as part of a n million statewide project using steel cables to tie the decks of the freeway to the columns and prevent the structure from swaying in a quake
<unk> spokesman <unk> <unk> in <unk> declined to identify the engineering firm that did the reinforcement work
liability in the bridge and road collapses will revolve around whether government took reasonable care to build and maintain the structures says <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> personal - injury attorney who specializes in highway design and maintenance cases
the firm brought in to strengthen the structure could be liable as well
the results of the quake certainly raise questions about whether reasonable care was taken <unk> <unk> says <unk>
given the seismic history of the <unk> <unk> it seems to me that a <unk> earthquake is a foreseeable event
<unk> <unk> <unk> defended the agency work on the <unk> <unk>
the work was done properly he said
basically we had a severe earthquake of significant duration and it was just something n the structure could n't withstand
ironically <unk> this year began working on a second round of seismic reinforcements of freeways around the state this time wrapping freeway columns in steel blankets to reinforce them
but only bridges supported with single rows of columns were top priority and the <unk> <unk> supported by double rows was left out <unk> <unk> explained <unk>
the reason is that the technology is such that we not able to retrofit multi - column structures he said
<unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> contributed to this article

he visited the <unk> devastation but not until after local leaders urged him to do so

profit after taxes and minority interests but before extraordinary items increased <unk> to n million from n million a year earlier while fully diluted earnings per share rose to <unk> pence n cents from <unk> pence n cents
the lethal shudders that wracked the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> rated a n on the <unk> scale did n't match the great earthquake of <unk> rated at <unk>
the difference of just n points on the scale designed by <unk> <unk> of <unk> in the n means n the older quake was <unk> to n times stronger says <unk> <unk> director of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the ground ruptured along a <unk> stretch of the <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> added <unk>
in <unk> the rupture was n miles long and a couple feet wide
though the epicenter of <unk> temblor was located <unk> miles north of the town of <unk> <unk> and <unk> miles south of <unk> <unk> its havoc hopscotched up the coast in seemingly random fashion
but the greatest damage was visited on buildings and roadways perched upon landfill as were the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> two areas of maximum devastation
<unk> loose and unconsolidated earth may feel like rock but it behaves like liquid when you shake it said <unk> <unk> professor of geosciences at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a televised interview
it liquefies in a patchwork quilt pattern
our quake behaved much like the <unk> <unk> earthquake where great damage was miles from the epicenter
<unk> <unk> of the <unk> seismographic station said <unk> can be done if it properly compacted
you can drive piles on it and build on it
he cited the example of <unk> <unk> financial district where many new glass towers survived almost unscathed
but the public policy issues raised by earthquake damage will be difficult n to address <unk> <unk> predicted n
the attention span of the public is short he said
we known for years and years n we got lots of old n unreinforced brick and masonry buildings
one old building the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> had its yellow brick facade sheared off by the shock of the quake leaving a wedge of its third floor open to the air while piles of dusty bricks tumbled to the street below narrowly missing rush - hour pedestrians and cars
reinforcing such old building stock <unk> <unk> said <unk> comes down to money
it a danger
we know n it there
and sooner or later we have to do something about it
the urgency is heightened because this week earthquake while major and followed by hundreds of aftershocks did n't release enough pent - up energy tension along the faultlines to preclude more and bigger quakes soon
the big one is still due <unk> <unk> predicted in an interview
the <unk> <unk> has three very dangerous faults the <unk> <unk> the <unk> fault and the calaveras fault
it <unk> quake has n't solved our problem
in <unk> this is the reality

after the confusion surrounding the change of the <unk> formula in <unk> <unk> - <unk> was reluctant to clutter the <unk> name with a brand extension
but now the soft - drink giant appears willing to take the risk
the name <unk> <unk> has tremendous value and they have n't merchandised that name before says <unk> <unk> publisher of the trade journal <unk> <unk>
the <unk> spokesman said <unk> a caffeine - free classic should help increase volume of the original brand
indeed analysts have said that the absence of new products among other factors has limited sales growth throughout the industry
<unk> now leads <unk> in market share in caffeine - free diet colas but trails <unk> in sales of caffeine - free sugared colas according to <unk> <unk>
<unk> introduced a caffeine - free sugared cola based on its original formula in <unk>
it switched to a caffeine - free formula using its new <unk> in <unk>
<unk> has been studying the possibility of introducing a caffeine - free classic for a year a company spokesman said n
he said <unk> large increases in sales of other non - caffeine soft drinks make the timing right now

<unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> third - quarter net income slipped <unk> from a record year - ago quarter
the decline broke a streak of n quarters in which <unk> posted earnings increases
<unk> third - quarter net fell to n million or <unk> a share from n million or <unk> a share a year ago
sales in the latest quarter rose <unk> to n billion from n billion a year earlier
<unk> closed at <unk> a share up n cents in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> composite trading
a spokeswoman said <unk> <unk> is comfortable with <unk> <unk> expectations that full - year earnings will total about n a share compared with last year record net of <unk> billion or <unk> a share
but that signal on full - year profit casts doubt on whether <unk> will improve on its year - ago fourth - quarter net of <unk> a share or n million
<unk> would earn <unk> a share for the year if it equaled that year - ago fourth - quarter performance
<unk> officials were signaling that the company would earn less than <unk> a share this year even before they announced in <unk> a plan to acquire n of <unk> <unk> <unk>
that acquisition could further dilute earnings per share this year the company spokeswoman said n
<unk> has n't said exactly what impact the <unk> acquisition will have on <unk> earnings
<unk> blamed the third - quarter earnings drop on several factors including softer prices for polyethylene and other basic chemicals a slower <unk> economy and a stronger dollar which made <unk> exports from the <unk> more expensive to overseas customers
another problem was a <unk> increase in operating costs at a time when revenue was rising by only n
for the first nine months of the year <unk> earned <unk> billion or <unk> a share up n from <unk> billion or <unk> a share a year ago
sales for the latest nine months rose <unk> to n billion from n billion in the year - ago period
whether or not great cases make bad - law as <unk> <unk> asserted who can doubt that when great confirmation hearings turn on the nominee response to these great cases they make bad judicial history
<unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> how the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> pages <unk> is a spirited narrative of the nastiest of these hearings done with journalistic verve but with a flawed legal philosophy
while the book amply justifies its subtitle the title itself is dubious
what shook <unk> was not a battle for justice but for naked power in which an army of judicial activists rolled over a judge <unk> they had demonized
in its basic structure and style the book is novelistic with piquant character portrayal hard - wire action and devious intrigue of the sort more likely to be encountered in a <unk> docudrama than in a constitutional history
<unk> <unk> seems to believe that the hearings could have gone either way
i doubt that
given democratic frustration with the <unk> victories and <unk> appointments the contingency plans in place and <unk> <unk> paper trail of vulnerable writings it was pretty clear that <unk> <unk> never stood much chance of being confirmed
as <unk> <unk> himself says n the smell of raw meat was in the air
perhaps because they won <unk> <unk> attackers come through more vividly than his defenders
<unk> <unk> was the organizing genius whipping a conglomerate of pressure groups into an irresistible attacking force
<unk> <unk> <unk> was the constitutional heavy laying out legal strategies <unk> for the senators and witnesses to follow
but it was <unk> <unk> who scored most effectively with his searing portrayal of <unk> <unk> <unk> the parade of imaginary horribles that would follow logically he claimed n from the positions <unk> <unk> <unk> had taken over the space of two decades
<unk> <unk> never mind his dubious credentials for the moral high ground emoted brilliantly
i add two others
republican <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> engaged the nominee in a verbal contest aimed at showing that <unk> <unk> was willing to stretch the <unk> in one area free speech while remaining rigid in all the others
it achieved a good media play and enabled <unk> <unk> and others to vote against <unk> <unk> out of conscience
further ammunition came from left legal theorist <unk> <unk> who in the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> painted a picture of a constitutional zombie willfully reading his personal prejudices into the <unk> particularly in the area of original intent
the charge of being outside the mainstream of legal thought gravely undercut <unk> <unk> scholarly standing leaving him bleeding on the platform
the nomination still might have been salvaged if a number of democratic moderates in the <unk> and <unk> had broken party lines
but democratic <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> reminded the little band that anti - <unk> blacks and women could furnish the margin <unk> to punish them in their next <unk> elections
demographics converged with mainstream and demonizing to seal <unk> <unk> fate
the upshot
<unk> <unk> opponents chose the battlefield held it and kept it
yet with the smooth confirmation of <unk> <unk> an n percenter only slightly less supportive of judicial restraint than <unk> <unk> the democrats may have won the battle but lost the war
another upshot however was the chilling message n the <unk> hearings sent into the judicial culture from which the <unk> <unk> draws its talent
the word went forth to every law school that those with federal court ambitions must travel a safe constitutional journey with no paper trail and no bite to their tongue or pen
unfortunately the author simply does n't supply the philosophical frame <unk> to sustain his reportorial talents
he has too readily swallowed the case for the activist law school culture
probing more deeply into the doctrine of judicial restraint he would have found a long history going back to the great decisions of <unk> <unk>
he would discover it also in <unk> <unk> a subtle constitutional scholar <unk> <unk> closest friend at <unk> whose influence on the judge goes well beyond <unk> <unk> reporting
still the long view of <unk> <unk> as constitutional thinker must be a spotty one
his strength lies in his majoritarian doctrine which keeps the <unk> clear of transient group pressures and leaves most decisions in a democracy to elected legislatures and executives
unfortunately <unk> <unk> failed to distinguish between such pressures and the emergence of great issues critical to a society that must be settled judicially if it is to cohere
the question of segregated schools in <unk> vs. <unk> of <unk> was such an issue
in our time abortion has become another best left to a line of <unk> <unk> decisions rather than to the chaos of n state legislatures
a reflective and growing consensus of americans clearly wishes to apply the right to privacy in contraceptive matters decided in the <unk> case to abortion as well
one can understand <unk> <unk> fear that the new right to privacy will become intolerably stretched though a <unk> <unk> composed of men and women with realism guts and a sense of limits should be able to manage it
what is certain is that if americans allow another happening like the degrading <unk> confirmation circus it will be at their peril
<unk> <unk> is a writer and historian living in <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> the world biggest auction house is taking a huge <unk> <unk> - style risk on the outcome of the sale of art from the estate of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> heir
the <unk> <unk> division has guaranteed the <unk> family that it will receive a minimum of n million for the collection regardless of what the bids for the art works total people close to the transaction say n
the collection which includes two early picassos a van <unk> a <unk> other paintings furniture and porcelains went on sale last night in the first of six auctions
what <unk> is doing closely resembles an underwriting by an investment bank
a corporation that wants to sell stock or bonds goes to a <unk> <unk> firm which purchases the securities outright accepting the financial risk of finding buyers
if the investment bank can sell the securities at a higher price than it paid the issuer it makes a profit
at the initial sale last night for example the sale featuring the impressionists masters bids totaled n million
that was slightly above <unk> presale estimate of n million
normally <unk> would have earned n of the total in commissions
instead people familiar with the transaction said <unk> the auction house opted to forgo that percentage in order to obtain the collection and in exchange for taking a bigger chunk of proceeds exceeding n million
art dealers say that while auction houses occasionally guarantee the seller of a highly desirable work of art a minimum price a financial commitment of this size is unprecedented
<unk> <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> <unk> division vehemently denies <unk> it offered the <unk> heirs a money - back guarantee calling such reports inaccurate
buried in the glossy hardbound catalog for the sale however appears the statement <unk> has an interest in the property in this catalog
explains <unk> a <unk> spokeswoman the statement means exactly what it says
we have some level of financial interest in the collection
we do n't disclose specifics
<unk> <unk> a lawyer for the <unk> estate with the <unk> law firm of <unk> <unk> <unk> declines to comment on the financial arrangements
<unk> made the <unk> million guarantee to keep the <unk> collection away from its archrival auction house <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has handled smaller sales for the <unk> family over the years
when <unk> officials asked why the firm was n't picked to sell the <unk> collection representatives of the <unk> family told us n it was a question of financial considerations said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> head of impressionist and modern paintings
collectors who have made their money on <unk> <unk> have become an increasingly important part of the art business and their money has helped fuel the art boom but recently it appears <unk> <unk> has been returning the compliment
in <unk> <unk> <unk> essentially offered a <unk> <unk> - style bridge loan of about n million to australian businessman <unk> <unk> to enable him to purchase <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for n million
it was the highest bid in history for a work of art
but two weeks ago <unk> said that it has the painting under lock and key because the loan had not been fully repaid
<unk> is offering such deals because it an art sellers market at least where the best works are concerned says <unk> <unk> <unk> an attorney and author of the book <unk> <unk>
there seems to be a lot of art for sale but there more competition
the competition gives the seller the ability to cut a better deal he says n
the <unk> family will still receive a substantial portion of the auction proceeds above n million people familiar with the transaction said n
but it likely that <unk> will take a higher than usual commission called an override on the amount exceeding the guarantee
<unk> has been aggressively promoting the <unk> sale
at a news conference last <unk> announcing plans for the auction <unk> estimated its value in excess of n million
more recently <unk> has predicted n the collection will fetch n million
that the highest estimate for a single collection in auction history
the decision to put the entire collection on the block stunned many since <unk> <unk> had served as chairman of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and it had been assumed n many of the works would be donated to the institution
at last night sale <unk> of <unk> works that sold were purchased by <unk> <unk> <unk> the art - acquisition unit of <unk> <unk> a japanese conglomerate that owns n of <unk>
meanwhile <unk> guarantee is raising eyebrows in the art world
the consumer has to throw out the idea that the auction house is a disinterested middleman says <unk> <unk> art dealer <unk> <unk>
while he adds that he has no problem with auction houses who sell works in which they have a financial interest it ought not to be hidden in some small print
in such situations he says the house is going to put the best light on things
for example an auction house comments on the condition of a work of art that is up for sale should be looked at with very open eyes he says n
there more and more of this cash - up-front going on at every level says <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> <unk> an art lender
dealers and auction houses know n if they do n't lay out a half a million for this another one will it that competitive
in <unk> two small <unk> <unk> galleries the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> snatched a major art collection owned by the <unk> family away from rival auction - house bidders with an up - front payment of about n million
a <unk> spokeswoman said that while the auction house sometimes waives its seller commission to attract art works it still gets a commission from the buyer <unk> wo n't offer financial guarantees because <unk> believes n its primary role is as an auction house and therefore as an agent for buyer and seller not as a bank
<unk> <unk> the man tapped yesterday to become <unk> <unk> new leader faces the same task that has fallen to neighboring socialist colleagues reforming a country in crisis
but unlike the other new leaders in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> will face an immediate threat to his nation very existence german reunification
<unk> <unk> age <unk> is known as an old - guard ironfist one likely to continue the method of running a country that the <unk> <unk> made famous
even if he were to change his stripes and become another <unk> <unk> however he would still stand a good chance of losing a country
<unk> <unk> almost certainly will be a younger version of <unk> <unk> his rigid predecessor as dictator
<unk> <unk> has followed much the same career path as <unk> <unk> both spent years overseeing the <unk> <unk> <unk> the youth group that is the communist regime principal tool for stamping young germans into socialist citizens
more recently <unk> <unk> has been in charge of east german security and is the youngest member of the ruling <unk>
faced with another <unk> <unk> so many despairing <unk> germans are likely to flee that the two german peoples will get their reunification de facto on west german ground
but if <unk> <unk> arthritic <unk> does loosen up enough to permit <unk> <unk> to make serious efforts at reform he will face a challenge just as fundamental
abandoning socialism means abandoning the east german state reason for existence and with it the justification for its watchdogs and its <unk>
in this scenario it hard to imagine that a pale imitation of the <unk> <unk> could avoid being pulled into some kind of tie economic federal or stronger with <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> may need a bit of time to consolidate his empire which would do a lot n to promote <unk> <unk> one
cartoonists in <unk> <unk> have already mocked the exodus by imagining an advertisement placed by <unk> <unk> wanted one people
the west german embassies in <unk> <unk> and <unk> are continuing to find refugees at their gates
of course <unk> <unk> true to its tradition could tighten its borders yet further
two of the last gestures of the <unk> regime were to close the border to <unk> and install halogen lights in some spots along the frontier
but with world - wide opinion even apparently in <unk> against <unk> <unk> the country would have to turn itself into an <unk> to clamp down further on refugees
there have been some reports that <unk> <unk> is moving to soften his reputation notably rumors that it was he who kept <unk> <unk> state police off protesters backs at the country dismal n anniversary celebrations earlier this month
but even if he effects a <unk> - <unk> transformation he will face a serious ideological crisis and <unk> <unk> two
the problem is one that <unk> <unk> shares with other half - states such as <unk> <unk> but one n it must shoulder alone in the <unk> <unk>
when <unk> moves to reform it can at least lean on its past however flawed and short - lived <unk> <unk> interwar republic it was a nonsocialist democracy
czech reformers can recall the wilsonian ideals of the same period in their country
even the <unk> <unk> has <unk> the <unk> n to rediscover should it choose to
but <unk> <unk> is merely the land of truly existing socialism
beyond that it has to compete with <unk> <unk> for a claim to the german identity
up to now the main weapon of the worker and peasant state has been the ideology of socialism
with talk today of a second economic miracle in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> no longer can content itself with being the economic star in a loser league
without <unk> military and party behind it <unk> <unk> runs the risk of disintegrating
if it goes capitalist and increases trade with <unk> <unk> it will convert itself willy - nilly into an economic annex of the <unk> <unk>
there a certain cruel logic at work here it particularly appropriate and tragic that the land that produced <unk> <unk> should prove socialism failure in an experiment that uses its own people as controls
there may be forces that would delay this scenario
ideologues are the last n to surrender and germans are an ideological people
the protesters who greeted <unk> <unk> at <unk> <unk> airport earlier this month were n't shouting go <unk> they were chanting <unk> help us
ideologues on the other side of the border can also slow the process
<unk> <unk> governing conservative coalition is proving admirably true to the west german constitution by making more than n people of german descent automatic citizens this year alone
but within the government and in the think tanks outside it many <unk> germans maintain that they do n't want immediate reunification
politically this currently is wisdom particularly given a nervous neighboring <unk>
but it would be ironic if <unk> reunification just like its division eventually were the result of actions in centers of power other than <unk> and <unk>
in a statement that was as close as <unk> <unk> gets to practicing glasnost <unk> <unk> an east german party theorist actually acknowledged the reunification dilemma
the main problem <unk> <unk> said <unk> in an east german radio interview monitored by <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> stems from the fact that the <unk> is different from other east european states

some analysts note that after last week stock market tailspin and <unk> <unk> earthquake it hard to gauge where the central bank wants the key federal funds rate
they say that the earthquake by preventing many banks from operating at full capacity has given the <unk> an additional reason n to keep liquidity at a high level
the <unk> did in fact execute n billion of liquidity - enhancing customer repurchase agreements the third set of repurchase orders in three days

trading on little specific information market players overnight in <unk> began bidding up oil prices
the rally spread into european markets where traders were still betting that the earthquake disrupted the <unk> <unk> area large oil refining plants

for more than the past year even the rumor of a major <unk> <unk> refinery shutdown has been enough to spark a futures rally because the gasoline market is so tight
but yesterday as the morning wore on some major <unk> <unk> refinery operators including <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> unit of <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> their refineries were n't damaged and were continuing to operate normally
most said n they shut down their petroleum pipeline operations as a precaution but did n't see any immediate damage

the analyst said <unk> it will take about two to three months before the mine begins to produce copper in significant quantities
he added that while there has n't been any official announcement as yet the <unk> <unk> mine strike in <unk> <unk> which has lasted more than three months is regarded as settled
another analyst said <unk> the <unk> return to operation may not be as near as some expect <unk>
there are still negotiations taking place on whether there will be a loss of jobs which has been a critical issue all along he said
nevertheless the increasing likelihood that these two major supply disruptions will be resolved weighed on the market the analysts agreed n
both of these mines are normally major suppliers of copper to <unk> which has been buying copper on the world market
the first analyst said that the <unk> as well as the chinese bought copper earlier in the week in <unk> but that this purchasing has since slackened as the supply situation at least over the long term appears to have improved
the focus for some time has been on the copper supply and good demand has been taken for granted he said
now that the supply situation seems to be improving it would be best for traders to switch their concentration to the demand side
he noted the <unk> <unk> report yesterday that housing starts in <unk> dropped <unk> from <unk> to n million units on an annualized basis the lowest level in seven years
along with these factors other economic reports suggest a slowing of the economy which could mean reduced copper usage he said
sugar
futures prices extended <unk> gains
the <unk> delivery ended with an advance of <unk> cent a pound to n cents for a two - day gain of n cent
according to one dealer <unk> said <unk> it has only <unk> tons of sugar remaining to be shipped to it this year by <unk> under current commitments
the announcement was made because of reports <unk> that <unk> would delay shipments to <unk> scheduled for later this year into early next year
the dealer said <unk> the quantity mentioned in the japanese announcement is so small that it meaningless
one analyst said <unk> he thought n the market continued to be supported to some degree by a delay in the cuban sugar harvest caused by adverse weather
the dealer said <unk> <unk> might be the real factor that is keeping futures prices firm
that country recently bought <unk> tons of sugar and had been expected to seek a like quantity last week but did n't
it known n they need the sugar and the expectation that they will come in is apparently giving the market its principal support the dealer said
<unk> and meats
the <unk> <unk> is expected to announce tomorrow that the number of cattle in the <unk> major ranch states slipped <unk> to n million on <unk> n compared with the level a year earlier said <unk> <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
cattle prices have risen in recent weeks on speculation that the government quarterly report will signal tighter supplies of beef
among other things the government is expected to report that the number of young cattle placed on feedlots during the quarter slipped n
feedlots fatten cattle for slaughter so a drop indicates that the production of beef will dip this winter
indeed some analysts expect the government to report that the movement of young cattle onto feedlots in the month of <unk> in seven big ranch states dropped <unk> compared with the level for <unk> n
the following issues were recently filed with the securities and <unk> <unk>

a new drug n to prevent the rejection of transplanted organs has been successfully used on more than n patients at the <unk> of <unk> according to researchers
the drug which is still in the experimental phase has n't been approved yet by the <unk> and <unk> <unk> and its long - term effects are unknown
but researchers say n the drug called n could revolutionize the transplantation field by reducing harmful side effects and by lowering rejection rates
rejection has been the major obstacle in the approximately n organ transplants performed world - wide each year
researchers began using the drug in <unk> on patients who had received kidney liver heart and pancreas transplants
only two of n transplants have been rejected
the drug discovered in <unk> is metabolized from soil fungus found in <unk>
the <unk> patients are the first humans n to be given the drug which is made by <unk> <unk> <unk>
we shocked by it because it worked so fast said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> director of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> at a news conference here yesterday
we consider it a life - saving drug like one for <unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> an immunologist at the <unk> of <unk>
researchers say n they believe <unk> <unk> is n times more effective than the traditional anti - rejection drug cyclosporine made by swiss pharmaceutical giant <unk> <unk>
they are also encouraged by the relatively mild side effects of n compared with cyclosporine which can cause renal failure morbidity nausea and other problems
the side effects of cyclosporine have made the penalty for its success rather high <unk> <unk> said
<unk> <unk> said that n would not be available in the market for at least a year and that the <unk> approval process usually takes three years to five years
there are no firm plans to expand the experimental program beyond the <unk> of <unk> whose hospital performs the most transplants in the world
researchers could n't estimate the cost of the drug when it reaches the market but they said <unk> <unk> will enable patients to cut hospital stays by <unk> and reduce the number of blood tests used to monitor the dosage of cyclosporine and other drugs among transplant recipients
<unk> <unk> said n the research has been largely financed by the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and by university funds and that <unk> did n't give the hospital any grants
he said that the research team had no financial stake in the drug
we known for six months the effect of this drug and our advice to our people has been not to buy the company stock <unk> <unk> said adding that profiting from <unk> would n't be ethical
economist <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> n editorial - page article in <unk> <unk> a man - made disaster decries the control of price gouging swiftly ordered by <unk> <unk> governor after <unk> <unk>
according to <unk> <unk> screaming for price controls occurs when income redistribution threatens to hit home
to be sure the threat has hit home down here
yet in <unk> <unk> rehash of free - market logic human greed and self - interest are the only permissible psychological reactions
allowing uncontrolled prices for necessities would indeed shorten the lines at stores as he contends n
but not because resources are going to their most efficient use leaving scarce goods allocated to those buyers who place the highest value on them
rather lines would diminish because at higher prices many victims could not afford necessities such as food and medical supplies
it is inhumane to imply that a poor unemployed woman can not receive immediate relief for her family at fair prices because she does not have as much n to protect as a rich family
moreover essential relief supplies such as ice must be distributed throughout the population because of potential health problems from spoiled food and possible outbreak of disease
such spillover effects give the state a right to intervene in the marketplace and temporarily coordinate allocation of resources
fortunately volunteers and charities are not motivated by self - interest but by altruism
why should they have to co - exist with opportunists rushing in to turn a quick profit
these latter - day scalawags would be ill - advised to take advantage of the situation if they ever expect to face the people of <unk> <unk> again
the government is actually protecting avaricious ice - baggers and other profiteers who can not see beyond their own short - term gain
<unk> <unk> deserves an a for its quick and timely relief efforts

give him an f for his failure to understand the ethics of economic equity

<unk> <unk> gives us an idea why economists predictions are usually wrong
they set up absurd situations detached from reality and then try to reason from them
i surprised n he did n't advocate letting people loot since that behavior can also be foreseen in a disaster and every individual has an incentive to alter the distribution of income in his favor
price controls were so fervently embraced by <unk> because price gouging in this situation is equivalent to looting
<unk>

<unk> <unk> described one of the more insidious threats n we face when dealing with disasters such as <unk> anti - profiteering ordinances such as that by the <unk> <unk> <unk> as it thrashed about trying to do something
since he concentrated on the economic folly of such ordinances he did n't mention certain other of their effects
they divert law - enforcement resources at a time n they are most needed for protecting lives and property
also rather than increase supplies they reduce them and encourage hoarding
and they or even the prospect of them discourage disaster preparedness in the form of speculative advance stocking of supplies by merchants
<unk> <unk>

would <unk> <unk> also suggest that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> military units police fire departments rescue units and individual citizens cease their efforts to assist <unk> victims because they interfere with his concept of the free market
what about those caring people all over the country who are donating food water and other necessities of life to these people who could be any of us
should they too stop messing with his free market
maybe he thinks n they should also sell to the highest bidder
and what about insurance firms
should they be required to pay claims based on exorbitant costs for labor and materials
<unk> <unk> should beware since he lives in <unk> <unk>
in a free market his insurance rates can be raised to recover insurance - company losses

having been through several tornadoes and hurricanes i have a different perspective
<unk> comes from seeing thriving communities devastated but only temporarily
their recovery came surprisingly fast and always with the help of neighbors
the shock of seeing homes destroyed and city services disrupted may cause some to confuse priorities such as the true economic value of a freezer full of meat
in <unk> after <unk> <unk> major grocery chains used their truck fleets to ship essential goods to <unk> no gouging just good will

we here in the affected areas were dazzled by <unk> <unk> analysis of time values and his comparisons of effectiveness concerning research and development
his theoretical approach and its publication in this venerable paper are no doubt a noteworthy accomplishment for him
too bad theory fails in practice
we consumers tend to have long memories
the businesses subscribing to <unk> <unk> effective price system will be remembered when normalcy returns
perhaps considering the value of our time we will be unable to patronize their establishments in the post - <unk> era
i have a question for <unk> <unk> how do i explain to the single mother of three standing in line next to me for the past three hours that the two bags of ice n she needs to keep her children food edible will take her last n

this seems to be the season for revivals in <unk>
though the cubs championship season ended with the <unk> <unk> playoffs a revival of the <unk> <unk> production of <unk> <unk> a play in nine innings set in the <unk> <unk> bleachers continues within spitting distance of the ballpark
revivals of a different sort also are being offered by our two major theater troupes the <unk> and <unk>
each is more problematic than an unexpected divisional baseball championship but both help explain why <unk> remains a vital center of this country regional theater movement
the <unk> is offering a modernized version of <unk> the misanthrope through <unk> n
the original is a comedy about <unk> a man who sees falseness and vanity in everyone except himself
he is the jealous friend of <unk> and the jealous lover of <unk>
the play is filled with intrigue dishonesty and injustice
twenty - five years ago the poet <unk> <unk> modernized this n comedy merely by avoiding the zounds sort of thing as he wrote in his introduction
otherwise the scene remained <unk> <unk> in <unk>
assuming n modern audiences readily understand that <unk> social indictment covers their world as well as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> concentrated his formidable artistry on rendering the alexandrine french verse into sprightly and theatrical english iambic pentameter
the <unk> translation is remarkable well worth a read and even better seen in the theater if you ever have the opportunity
but if you happen to be coming to <unk> in the next few weeks do n't fail to have a look at <unk> <unk> the misanthrope at the <unk>
if <unk> <unk> translation is a finely ground lens through which we see the pettiness and corruption of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> production is a mirror in which we see ourselves
<unk> <unk> the <unk> artistic director took a recent adaptation by <unk> <unk> and significantly adapted it
<unk> <unk> had slimmed <unk> cast of characters to six and set them in the <unk> media world of thatcherite <unk>
<unk> <unk> transfers the setting to <unk> and transforms the characters into what passes for aristocracy there agents producers actors writers and sycophants
it works
<unk> <unk> managed to more or less maintain <unk> alexandrine verse form n syllable lines in rhyming couplets
<unk> <unk> kept the form but americanized it with <unk> <unk> further help
with a splendid cast led by <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> and especially <unk> <unk> as a <unk> who plays the <unk> game but harbors authentic values and feelings the <unk> production barrels through an all - night <unk> party with exuberance and wit
if this version with its references to <unk> <unk> <unk> and thirtysomething attracts younger audiences who might stay away from the classical version then messrs. <unk> and <unk> are justified in abandoning <unk> <unk>
a n play may be easier n to revive than one merely n
the <unk> <unk> <unk> back from a critical and box office success in <unk> with its adaptation of <unk> the <unk> of <unk> opened the new season with <unk> <unk> the <unk> first produced by the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>
back then <unk> <unk> was not only the angry young british playwright but also the first n to use silences and sentence fragments and menacing stares almost to the exclusion of what we previously understood to be theatrical dialogue
when the <unk> was first produced on this side of the <unk> actors and directors were reverential
silences were lengthy nobody moved or gestured
nobody smiled onstage and nobody in the audience was encouraged to laugh
this kind of theater was new to us
also it was not a funny time over here what with the <unk> <unk> the <unk> democratic convention assassinations and riots
but under <unk> <unk> direction the current <unk> production scheduled to play through <unk> n breaks through the flat and boring ritual that the homecoming had become
led by a near - perfect performance by <unk> <unk> as <unk> the father the play is at once an appalling and hilarious dissection of a family rage bitterness fear and isolation
encouraged by <unk> <unk> sly grins embarrassed grimaces and sputtering rages the audience gets the joke and begins to laugh before the end of the first act
three of the family members <unk> and his two sons <unk> and <unk> live off the flesh <unk> is a retired butcher <unk> a pimp and <unk> an aspiring boxer
<unk> <unk> brother has escaped the flesh by working as a liveried chauffeur and never seeking a wife
<unk> the eldest of <unk> sons has made the most dramatic escape by becoming a professor of philosophy at an american university
though it clearly <unk> wife who held sway here until her death now none of the other male residents of this misbegotten household can challenge <unk>
the play concerns <unk> homecoming with his wife of six years <unk>
curiously <unk> <unk> as <unk> seems the only cast member unable to get beyond the zombie approach to a <unk> character
as <unk> <unk> <unk> a large and beautiful woman who may be our next <unk> <unk> begins almost immediately to overpower each of the men
in the end <unk> returns alone to <unk> leaving <unk> in <unk> chair
we have seen her develop within a few hours from a shy and unknown in - law to a goddess of the flesh who will replace the dead mother and then some
while <unk> was in <unk> with the grapes of wrath <unk> <unk> the president of its board of directors quietly returned to <unk> to buy a piece of real estate in the city rapidly reviving <unk> <unk> <unk> restaurant and theater district
within a year he hopes <unk> <unk> will move into a new <unk> theater on that site
the troupe currently performs in a converted dairy that seats n and provides little capacity for staging anything beyond a simple one - set production
if we wanted to stage death of a <unk> <unk> <unk> says <unk> <unk> would have to live in a ranch house because of the low ceiling
<unk> needs the extra seats even more than the fly space
it currently forced to turn away many potential subscribers beyond the n who can be accommodated in its present digs
for all the attention that <unk> theater has received during the past decade not one new building has been devoted to it
<unk> <unk> a former publisher and real estate developer has put together an n million financial package that includes approximately n million of tax exempt bonds issued by the <unk> of <unk> the first time that a state has used its educational facilities authority to support construction of a theater and approximately n million in grants from the <unk> <unk> for the <unk> the <unk> <unk> and a few other deep pockets
the rest he is confident n can be raised
his board members alone have pledged n and he is just beginning to massage local foundations and corporations
<unk> <unk> compares the importance of <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the n
but <unk> theater company turned out to have a brief one might say a mercurial existence
what will <unk> <unk> do with his new theater building if the allure of <unk> and <unk> proves too much for such <unk> stalwarts as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> chronicles and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the company crumbles
that ok <unk> <unk> replies
let this building be <unk> legacy to <unk> theater

much of the jockeying by <unk> traders and investors centered on shares of companies that might be financially affected by damage from the devastating earthquake in northern <unk>

then if the stocks fell sharply he planned to begin buying them aggressively on the theory that the companies that insure against property damage and accidents will have to raise rates eventually to compensate for the claims n they will pay to earthquake victims and victims of last month <unk> <unk>
as well reinsurers and insurance brokerage companies will have improved profits
many investors expected damage from the hurricane to be the catalyst for higher rates in the industry which has been depressed because of low rates arising from intense competition
but <unk> <unk> said <unk> the hurricane damage was n't extensive enough to prompt premium boosts
the companies just gave back what they had reserved for he said
now they have to increase their coffers to protect for the future and that means rate increases

within minutes after the stock market closed <unk> i called <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> advised him that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> had declined by <unk> points late that afternoon and cheerfully informed him that he and his fellow democrats were to blame
they had dealt a major setback that afternoon to <unk> <unk> capital - gains tax cut proposal which had seemed in the bag after it passed the house overwhelmingly earlier in the month
<unk> <unk> has it in his mind that such a tax cut would unravel the tax reform n he helped engineer in <unk>
but he knows that as many as n of his fellow democrats are disposed to vote for the cut popular among their constituents
as a result he took the lead in arguing that the cut should be blocked on procedural grounds
he helped persuade n of these senators to support him and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on these grounds
the budget reconciliation had to be dealt with by the <unk> n deadline and these <unk> democrats refused to agree to allow a vote n to append capital gains to the budget bill knowing n it would pass
denied a vote on substance the <unk> leadership in the <unk> on <unk> morning was confronted with a hard choice
it could throw in the towel and hope to win on capital gains late this month or it could follow the <unk> <unk> strategy to veto reconciliation unless capital gains was appended
the <unk> <unk> of <unk> has been in the forefront in supporting the <unk> proposal
it endorsed the <unk> <unk> strategy believing it to be the surest way to victory
at noon <unk> a senior <unk> <unk> official advised <unk> <unk> the <unk> chief economist that the <unk> <unk> would not agree to a budget reconciliation bill unless it had firm assurances that a vote on substance would be permitted in the <unk>
two hours later the first word emerged on <unk> <unk> that the administration had agreed to reconciliation with no such assurances from <unk> democrats
<unk> <unk> was shocked telephoning the office of <unk> <unk> director of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> and the administration chief strategist on this issue
he left a message accusing <unk> <unk> of selling out
it was the <unk> republicans though who had edged away from the veto strategy
the stock market reacted as <unk> <unk> did crumbling as it absorbed the news that <unk> <unk> strategy had been abandoned
the stock market after all represents the collective expectations about the value of the future income stream of the nation capital stock discounted to present value
why should it be so surprising that a n cut in the capital - gains tax would have such an enormous impact on the value of the nation capital stock
the total value of privately held assets is easily more than n trillion
the value traded on the exchanges is close to n trillion
if the tax on any gain to those assets was doubled would n't the value fall to the owners of the assets
is n't it reasonable to assume that the asset n you own would be worth more if the government suddenly announced that if you sold it you would be able to keep n more of its gain than you previously believed n
indeed the stock market steady advance this year tracked with <unk> <unk> success in advancing his capital - gains proposal
a n cut in this year capital gains alone amounts to roughly n billion
we talking real money
when <unk> <unk> advised the financial press that the market crash was caused by the setback to capital gains he was generally ignored and mildly ridiculed
instead the press corps readily accepted the notion that a snag in the takeover financing of <unk> <unk> instantly knocked <unk> off the value of the nation capital stock and caused convulsions around the world
<unk> <unk> was pointing out an elephant rumbling through <unk> <unk> while conventional wisdom had fastened on the <unk> flea
why is this happening
for one thing quite a number of the leading spokesmen on <unk> <unk> are not portfolio managers who understand that the value of assets is greatly affected by how government taxes those assets
they are economists and financial reporters who sympathize with the view that a capital - gains tax cut benefits the rich
yet they somehow think that <unk> <unk> is indifferent to losing the tax cut that seemed so close <unk> morning and is now problematic
the market rebound <unk> followed weekend assurances from <unk> <unk> that the administration has other plans <unk> to win the cut which is alive and well
<unk> <unk> argument is that a capital - gains tax cut would be bad for the economy in the longer run
it would inevitably lead to an increase in marginal income - tax rates in <unk> he thinks n when the <unk> <unk> is forced to ask for higher taxes n to meet budget targets
that is with capital gains cut the glue of the <unk> accord will be gone and political realities will push up income - tax rates
the counter - argument which he has heard is that if he and his fellow democrats are successful in killing the president proposal the revenue gap will open up tremendously in <unk> because of the weakened economy
in this atmosphere there would be no serious consideration of tax increases
if <unk> <unk> would permit a vote on capital gains though it would pass <unk> retail sales would be strong instead of burdened by a falling stock market the <unk> economy would be robust and the revenue gains at every level of government including <unk> <unk> would be surprisingly high
no tax increases would be necessary
the struggle over capital gains is the most important game in town

the <unk> currently plans to issue a total of n billion in bonds to refinance its high - interest debt
the <unk> billion bond issue also will help the <unk> meet its goal of not raising rates for another year said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the agency chief financial officer
the bond issue is <unk> first public offering since the <unk> <unk> was created in <unk> primarily to finance the <unk>
but the offering almost did n't happen
the <unk> in fact decided to proceed with the bond offering following an agreement last week with the <unk> <unk> which allows <unk> to keep borrowing short term from the bank for two years after it goes to the public market
the <unk> contended that <unk> could n't borrow from both it and the public debt market

the verdict reached late last week in <unk> may end an eight - year legal battle for the <unk> <unk> carpet maker
<unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> had sued the com pany in n after installing <unk> carpets in their office
the beebes alleged that toxic fumes from the carpets made them sick
as a result of their illness the beebes said n they lost n million in wages and earnings
in addition they said that months of exposure to the chemicals has left them sensitive to a wide range of commonly used substances
the case had been closely watched because attorneys anticipate increasing litigation nationally over the so - called sick - building syndrome
plaintiffs lawyers say that buildings become sick when inadequate fresh air and poor ventilation systems lead pollutants to build up inside

he said that ill effects from new carpets manifest themselves immediately but that the beebes symptoms appeared months later

scientists are only beginning to understand what causes sick - building syndrome and much of that research was unavailable when the beebes filed the case she said n
the beebes now believe that a prime culprit for their injuries was fumes from an adhesive used in the carpeting
but the beebes did n't come to that conclusion until time limits had elapsed for adding the adhesives maker as a defendant in the case <unk> <unk> said <unk>

quotable
in a speech prepared for delivery in <unk> <unk> yesterday retired <unk> <unk> <unk> contested the notion that the last <unk> <unk> term marked a turn toward conservatism commentators who agreed on little else unanimously proclaimed a shift in direction on the court
i take these pronouncements like many that have preceded them in past years with a grain of salt
in an era of sound bites and instant opinion polls it is dangerous to apply broad labels to a single term
during its centennial year the <unk> <unk> <unk> will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of american business history
the <unk> <unk> <unk> when <unk> crashed into <unk> on <unk> n <unk> the holiest day in the jewish calendar lasted barely a month
but one far - afield effect is still with us
the arab states always bitterly resentful of <unk> support toward <unk> realized <unk> they held an irresistable weapon oil
early in <unk> six arab nations in the <unk> <unk> jacked up prices sharply
on <unk> n led by <unk> <unk> the world largest exporter they embargoed oil shipments to the <unk> and to the <unk> <unk> staunchest european ally
the timing was perfect
the arabs had tried embargos before
in <unk> when <unk> <unk> and <unk> invaded <unk> to seize the <unk> <unk> <unk> producers cut off supplies to <unk>
<unk> simply pumped harder
<unk> oil supplies however had peaked in <unk> and <unk> and by <unk> were declining
imports then six million barrels a day came primarily from <unk> and <unk>
but <unk> <unk> supplies were growing in importance
by <unk> the <unk> was bringing in two million barrels of arab oil a day more than n of the n million barrels consumed daily
politics and economics conspired
<unk> and <unk> far more dependent on mideast oil than the <unk> would n't offend the arabs or trade off their precious supplies
the <unk> did manage to supply the dutch with oil by relabeling supplies once oil is shipped no one can tell its source
but car - happy americans panicked and so did the <unk> and other oil - consuming governments
shortage and crisis became buzz words although neither really applied
the spot dislocations that showed up were largely the result of confusion much of it in <unk> though that was cold comfort for drivers waiting in mile - long lines at the gas pumps
the embargo lasted only six months but the price hikes became a fact of life
what the arabs started inflation finished
once and for all <unk> crude oil and n gasoline were history
<unk> may be tough on <unk> <unk> for some but a few bosses are making as much as ever or more
at <unk> <unk> <unk> . for example the <unk> executive officers led by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> got a pay increase to n million for the n period ended <unk> <unk> from n million for the <unk> months ended <unk> n n
the figures do n't include substantial dividends on holdings of <unk> <unk> stock
<unk> <unk> himself was paid n million before an estimated n million in dividends up from n million the year before
the increase is noted in the brokerage firm latest proxy statement filed with the securities and <unk> <unk>
because it operates on a fiscal year <unk> <unk> yearly filings are available much earlier than those of other firms
the latest period includes n months instead of <unk> because <unk> <unk> changed to a fiscal year ending in <unk> instead of <unk>
meanwhile <unk> <unk> <unk> stock and bond salesmen saw thinner paychecks over the past year which the company says <unk> reflected lower commission revenue caused by a decline in investor activity in the markets
however <unk> <unk> on <unk> reported improved earnings for its first quarter ended <unk> <unk> partly because of a <unk> increase in commissions during the quarter
<unk> <unk> <unk> chief financial officer defended the lofty salaries at <unk> <unk>
all of us are on a base salary of <unk> if the firm makes nothing and that pretty low as far as <unk> <unk> goes <unk> <unk> said
however <unk> <unk> has never had an unprofitable year since its founding n years ago
four <unk> <unk> executives besides the <unk> <unk> <unk> were paid n million or more before dividends for the <unk> months ended in <unk>
according to the proxy statement <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> president made <unk> million an executive vice president <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> made nearly n million and two executive vice presidents <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> made about n million each
<unk> <unk> said <unk> the firm has a straight mathematical formula for determining compensation based on the firm earnings
just because a particular element of the firm is down such as stockbrokerage does n't mean <unk> the executive committee should be paid less he said
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> group chief executive officer is taking over the chairmanship of the merchant banking group from <unk> <unk> <unk> who is retiring
<unk> <unk> will remain a member of the merchant bank board
<unk> <unk> is widely credited with refocusing <unk> <unk> energies on its core corporate finance fund management and banking activities over the past year
last year <unk> <unk> shut down its ailing <unk> securities operations
<unk> <unk> said <unk> his move to the chairmanship means n he will take a less active role in the day - to-day management of the group but he added that the merchant bank strategic focus remains unchanged
<unk> <unk> joined <unk> <unk> as group chief executive in <unk> n a few months after the resignations of former <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other top officials because of the merchant bank role in <unk> <unk> controversial takeover of <unk> <unk> in <unk>
<unk> <unk> had advised <unk> on the bid which was surrounded by allegations that <unk> used artificial means to support the bid value
<unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> currently group deputy chief executive will assume the chief executive position
the merchant bank also announced that finance director <unk> <unk> is taking early retirement for personal reasons
his duties will be taken over by <unk> <unk> - <unk> who has been elected deputy chairman
news of <unk> <unk> retirement comes one day after <unk> said that <unk> <unk> resigned as chairman of <unk> banking subsidiary to join a financial services firm
<unk> <unk> said <unk> both <unk> <unk> and <unk> had planned to leave the bank earlier but <unk> <unk> had persuaded them to remain until the bank was in a healthy position
if there any coincidence about the departures it that they are leaving at a time when the business is in reasonably good shape and going forward very well

the spokesman said n he also understood that the inquiry related to the existence of an off - the-record production book
the book noted changes made at the manufacturing level that were n't disclosed to the <unk>
<unk> said n it is cooperating in the investigation
also yesterday <unk> <unk> a former <unk> official who pleaded guilty to providing an <unk> employee an illegal gratuity of <unk> was sentenced by a federal judge in <unk> to one year of community service and a n fine

<unk> <unk> chairman said <unk> <unk> <unk> had taken significant steps n to restore the company credibility and sense of professionalism and integrity
just after midnight <unk> federal spending started to drop by <unk> billion
what do you say we all close down the poker game go home and bank the n billion
that essentially what budget director <unk> <unk> is suggesting and we think n he deserves as much support as he can get
if human beings ca n't cut federal spending honestly and they ca n't let the computers do it
<unk> with a measure of <unk> <unk> complicity has been manipulating the spending accounts for years under the cover of omnibus appropriations bills
indeed without earlier manipulations the current sequester of <unk> billion would have been even larger
we suspect <unk> voters are fed up with the finagling
consider for instance that even yesterday widely publicized sequester is likely to be traduced if business as usual is allowed to prevail
under the law <unk> - <unk> across - the-board-cuts in federal programs are supposed to be permanent
<unk> <unk> and spending for poor people are exempted
however the <unk> <unk> account of the <unk> sequester order signed by <unk> <unk> neatly captured the contempt <unk> <unk> shows toward the notion of a legally binding commitment
lawmakers have been saying for weeks that they plan to roll back the cuts as soon as they agree to a compromise on a deficit - cutting bill
<unk> <unk> inclination to save the sequester was backed up yesterday by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
there is some feeling here that the cuts are the way n to go
it will reduce spending in a very effective fashion
this attitude is being waved away by sophisticates around <unk> as little more than tough talk
it looks to us like a golden opportunity for <unk> <unk> to chop off at the knees all this talk about a timid unserious presidency
<unk> <unk> would be acting in the public interest if he let the <unk> elites who manipulate these budgets the bureaucrats the lobbyists the congressional staffers live for just one year on a restricted diet
ask <unk> <unk> thin is in
<unk> <unk> <unk> pointed out <unk> that in the <unk> years before <unk> - <unk> was enacted in <unk> federal spending grew by about <unk> a year since the law it grown at under <unk> annually
another major factor in this positive trend was <unk> <unk> decision early in his presidency to fight the budget war on the expenditure side rather than raising taxes
<unk> <unk> continued support of the tax dam sustains this strategy of pressuring <unk> to make choices among competing priorities rather than just saying yes to all the grateful special - interest constituencies that fill the <unk> trough
if <unk> elites ever succeed in bursting the tax dam americans will be engulfed in a red sea of new spending programs such as federalized child care
child care was one of the many extraneous bills pulled out of the <unk> reconciliation bill last <unk>
others were the capital - gains cut section n repeal the disabled workers bill and the unprecedented reconsideration of the catastrophic health act
all this stuff still is in the <unk> <unk> reconciliation bill and many members say n they reluctant to pull out cherished bills just to see them die
republicans especially want a guarantee from the <unk> leadership that they get an up - or-down vote on the bills
<unk> <unk> <unk> ought to deliver that promise
this is the way n government is supposed to work with politicians taking responsibility for votes that their constituents can identify instead of concealing them in the great reconciliation garbage truck
we have as much nostalgia as anyone for those leafy breezy days in <unk> when honorable men and women dickered over budgets and even log - rolled a bit to see that the bridges got build roads paved soldiers paid or that the desperately poor were cared for
those days are gone
nor do we see any reason n to believe that a metropolitan <unk> that has gotten fat and rich and lazy in the shadow of the federal colossus will change much on its own initiative
save the sequester and let <unk> scream

the <unk> rally seemed to confirm the view frequently expressed in <unk> in the past few days that the drop in <unk> <unk> was a local problem related to merger and acquisition activity in the <unk>
this time we do n't really have to worry about <unk> said an official at <unk> securities <unk>
nothing has changed fundamentally in the <unk> market
but even though <unk> appears unharmed by recent market volatility analysts and traders say n there are still a few concerns on the horizon
in particular japanese investors will be keeping a wary eye on <unk> <unk> to see whether <unk> <unk> rally holds up as fresh <unk> economic data are released
people are placing small bets
there no huge buying said <unk> <unk> head of equity sales at <unk> <unk> securities <unk> in <unk>
really brave views right now would be foolhardy
yesterday buyers favored real estate construction and other large - capitalization issues reflecting the fact that many <unk> investors now feel safer with domestically oriented stocks analysts said n
they also are concerned about the persistent strength of the dollar against the yen as a weaker yen leads to higher import prices in <unk> and adds to domestic inflationary pressures
currency concerns also weigh heavily on interest rate - sensitive stocks such as banking and other financial issues because of fears that japanese interest rates might have to rise to keep the dollar in check

the stock market dizzying gyrations during the past few days have made a lot of individual investors wish <unk> they could buy some sort of insurance
after all they wo n't soon forget the stock bargains that became available after the <unk> <unk> crash
but while they want to be on the alert for similar buying opportunities now they afraid of being hammered by another terrifying plunge
the solution at least for some investors may be a hedging technique that well known to players in the stock - options market
called a married put the technique is carried out by purchasing a stock and simultaneously buying a put option on that stock
it like fire insurance says <unk> <unk> <unk> the senior options strategist at <unk> <unk>
because a put option gives its owner the right but not the obligation to sell a fixed number of shares of the stock at a stated price on or before the option expiration date the investor is protected against a sudden drop in the stock price
but most investment advisers do n't recommend using married puts all the time
that because the cost of buying put options eats into an investor profit when stock prices rise
this is the type of fire insurance n you only buy when the nearby woods are on fire says <unk> <unk>
you always want your house insured but you do n't always feel the need for your investments to be insured
in addition to hedging new stock purchases the married - put technique can be used to protect stocks that an investor already owns
in either case the investor faces three possible outcomes
if the stock goes up in price between now and the put expiration date the put will probably expire worthless
the investor will be out the cost of the put which is called the premium and this loss will reduce the stock - market profit
if the stock stays at the same price between now and the put expiration date the investor loss will be limited to the cost of the put less any amount realized from a closing sale of the put
the worst - case scenario would be if the put expires worthless
if the price of the stock declines the put will increase in value
once the stock price is less than the exercise price or strike price of the put the gain will match the loss on the stock dollar for dollar
the put establishes a minimum selling price for the stock during its life
when a stock falls below the put strike price the investor simply sells the stock at a loss and simultaneously sells the put at a profit
or the investor can exercise the put by tendering the stock to his or her broker in return for payment from another investor who has sold a put on the same stock
brokers handle such transactions through the options <unk> <unk> which guarantees all option trades
the accompanying table shows how this strategy would work for three stocks
though not reflected in the table an investor should know that the cost of the option insurance can be partially offset by any dividends that the stock pays
for example <unk> <unk> pays a quarterly dividend of <unk> cents which would be received before the <unk> option expires and thus reduce the cost of using the technique by that amount
in this case the investor risk would n't exceed n of the total investment
to simplify the calculations commissions on the option and underlying stock are n't included in the table
there are more than n stocks on which options may be bought and sold including some over - the-counter stocks
but some investors might prefer a simpler strategy then hedging their individual holdings
they can do this by purchasing index puts which are simply put options on indexes that match broad baskets of stocks
for instance the most popular index option is the <unk> <unk> option commonly called the <unk>
it is based on the stocks that make up <unk> <unk> <unk> index
unlike options on individual issues index options are settled only in cash and no stock is ever tendered
but while index options are convenient they have several disadvantages
for one thing an investor portfolio might not closely match the <unk> <unk>
as a result the <unk> insurance may or may not fully protect an investor holdings in the event of a market decline
in addition <unk> options were suspended from trading last <unk> afternoon after the stock - market sell - off got under way and trading in the n futures contract was halted
so an investor who wanted to realize a profit on <unk> puts after the trading suspension would have been out of luck
on the other hand only a handful of individual issues were suspended from trading on <unk>
normally once the underlying investment is suspended from trading the options on those investments also do n't trade
ultimately whether the insurance provided by purchasing puts is worthwhile depends on the cost of the options
that cost rises in times of high market volatility
but it still might be cheaper than taking a major hit
the protection from using married puts is clearly superior to that afforded by another options strategy n some investors consider using during troubled times selling call options on stocks n the investor owns
a call option is similar to a put except that it gives its owner the right to buy shares at a stated price until expiration
selling a call option gives an investor a small buffer against a stock - market decline
that because it reduces the cost of the stock by the amount of premium received from the sale of the call
but if the price of the stock rises above the strike price of the option the stock is almost certain to be called away
and in that case the investor misses out on any major upside gain
these calculations exclude the effect of commissions paid and dividends received from the stock
all prices are as of <unk> close
hopes for quick enactment of pending deficit - reduction legislation faded as efforts to streamline the <unk> version in advance of a <unk> - <unk> conference broke down
<unk> leaders had hoped to follow the <unk> lead by getting an agreement from <unk> committee chairmen under which they would drop items that would n't reduce the fiscal <unk> budget deficit from the <unk> - passed bill before the negotiations with the <unk> began
but the effort became snagged on the question of what would become of other issues ranging from cutting the capital - gains tax to child care to repeal of catastrophic - illness insurance
many members feel n there are important features of the <unk> bill that should be enacted <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said
if there is any support for reducing the bill it is conditioned on their desire to see them passed in another form
now those items will be discussed in a <unk> - <unk> conference which could begin as soon as today with the expectation that they could either be resolved there or placed into other legislation
you got to give these chairmen the opportunity to see if they can work things out said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
this is a democratic process you ca n't slam - dunk anything around here
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has said n he would continue to press to keep the capital - gains provision in the final version of the bill unless the <unk> drops many of its costly provisions
<unk> leaders had hoped to be able to send a compromise version of the measure to <unk> <unk> by the end of the week but <unk> <unk> said <unk> that was n't likely
failure to pass the bill meant that <unk> billion in across - the-board spending cuts took effect <unk> under the <unk> - <unk> budget law
the bill must be enacted before the cuts can be restored

a surprising surge in the <unk> trade deficit raised fears that the nation export drive has stalled and caused new turmoil in financial markets
the merchandise trade deficit widened in <unk> to n billion the <unk> <unk> reported <unk> a sharp deterioration from <unk> <unk> billion and the largest deficit of any month this year
exports fell for the second month in a row while imports rose to a record
this is one of the worst trade releases n we had since the dollar troughed out in <unk> said <unk> <unk> chief international economist at <unk> <unk> <unk>
like most analysts <unk> <unk> was hesitant to read too much into one month numbers but he said it indicates perhaps that the balance in the <unk> economy is not as good as we been led to believe
the number had a troubling effect on <unk> <unk> suggesting that more fundamental economic problems may underlie last <unk> stock market slide
the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> tumbled more than <unk> points after the report release before recovering to close n points lower at n
this bad trade number raises some deeper issues about the market decline said <unk> <unk> chief economist for <unk> <unk>
it raises questions about more deep - seated problems the budget deficit and the trade deficit and the seeming lack of ability to come to grips with them
the trade report drew yet another unsettling parallel to <unk> n
on <unk> n of that year the announcement of an unusually large <unk> trade deficit helped trigger a steep market decline
the slide continued until the record n market drop on <unk> n
in <unk> however the news was the latest in a string of disappointments on trade while the current report comes after a period of improvement
the bleak trade report was played down by the <unk> administration
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> called the worsening trade figures disappointing after two very good months
and <unk> <unk> spokesman <unk> <unk> said <unk> the deficit was an unwelcome increase adding that we hopeful that it simply is a one - month situation and will turn around
but the figures reinforced the view of many private analysts that the improvement in the <unk> trade deficit has run out of steam
the figures today add further evidence n to support the view that the improvement in the <unk> trade deficit has essentially stalled out at a level of about a n billion annual rate said <unk> <unk> a research fellow at the <unk> for <unk> <unk> here
that still an improvement over last year but it leads one to conclude that basically we gotten all the mileage n we can out of past dollar depreciation and past marginal cuts in the federal budget deficit
exports declined for the second consecutive month in <unk> slipping n to n billion the <unk> <unk> reported <unk>
imports on the other hand leaped <unk> to a record n billion
not only was <unk> deficit far worse than <unk> but the government revised the <unk> figure substantially from the <unk> billion deficit <unk> it had initially reported last month
many economists contend that deep cuts in the <unk> budget deficit are needed before further trade improvement can occur
that because the budget deficit feeds an enormous appetite in this country for both foreign goods and foreign capital overwhelming the nation capacity to export
people are sick and tired of hearing about these deficits but the imbalances are still there and they are still a problem said <unk> <unk>
in addition the rise in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies over the past several months has increased the price of <unk> products in overseas markets and hurt the country competitiveness
since <unk> exports have been virtually flat
at the same time <unk> <unk> <unk> international vice president at the <unk> <unk> of <unk> notes clearly the stronger dollar has made imports more attractive by causing their prices to decline
most economists expect the slowing <unk> economy to curb demand for imports
but they foresee little substantial progress in exports unless the dollar and the federal budget deficit come down
the best result n we could get from these numbers would be to see the administration and <unk> get serious about putting the <unk> on an internationally competitive economic footing said <unk> <unk> vice president of international economic affairs at the <unk> <unk> of manufacturers
that must start with cutting the federal budget deficit
<unk> decline in exports reflected decreases in sales of industrial supplies capital goods and food abroad and increases in sales of motor vehicles parts and engines
the jump in imports stemmed from across - the-board increases in purchases of foreign goods

<unk> <unk> took a step back from the frontier of personal - computer technology in an effort to spur sales of <unk> <unk> new machine
<unk> <unk> moved to remedy a couple of his computer drawbacks yesterday by lowering the entry - level price for a next machine by <unk> or <unk> if the buyer chooses a hard - disk drive as an alternative to next optical - storage device
the hard drive which is the storage device of choice for virtually every desktop computer user also now will supplement next futuristic optical device if buyers pay full price
<unk> <unk> <unk> - founder of <unk> <unk> <unk> founded <unk> four years ago in the hopes of fomenting a revolution in the way n desktop computers are designed and used
his <unk> computer introduced about a year ago and aimed primarily at university computer users sports snazzy graphics digital sound built - in networking and a sleek black design
but the computer was proving a hard sell because of its high price a lack of software and an optical data - storage device that was too slow
the machine began shipping at the end of last year
the closely held company has n't disclosed sales
however most universities that have bought the machines say n they are buying small numbers for evaluation purposes
universities can now buy a <unk> computer without an optical storage device for <unk>
a computer with the optical device will still cost <unk> but from now on <unk> will outfit every computer with a hard drive and supply one at no cost to those who have already bought <unk> machines
commercial customers can purchase the same system through <unk> <unk> a computer retailer based in <unk> <unk> <unk> for roughly n more
<unk> <unk> said n the changes were prompted by requests from customers who are frustrated with the performance of the optical device which is n't offered as standard equipment by any rivals
another factor was that customers were asking why do n't you give us a cheaper system <unk> <unk> said <unk> at a conference on university computing here
optical - storage devices can handle very large amounts of data and make it far easier to edit film clips or audio recordings with a computer
but the technology while reliable is far slower than the widely used hard drives
to get around the delays caused by the optical device <unk> which is next exclusive dealer to corporations has for months been advising customers to purchase hard drives with the machines
next decision to rely on the more - established hard drive in every <unk> computer does n't signal a retreat from optical storage said <unk> <unk> <unk> who for years has said n this technology will play a crucial role in the next decade
we extremely committed to optical storage technology he said
we think n everything will go this way in a few years
he said that the next generation of optical drives will be as fast as hard drives but he depends on outside suppliers for the devices
but university computer specialists who welcomed the move called it a necessary retreat from the cutting edge of technology and one that likely to increase next sales on campuses
from the standpoint of being on the forefront of technology this is a step backward said <unk> <unk> <unk> a senior computing manager for the <unk> state university system
but it will definitely boost next sales
universities however say <unk> <unk> prices must go even lower before large numbers of students purchase the machine
we still like to see a student model priced at about <unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> director of academic computing at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which has bought eight <unk> machines
broad acceptance of <unk> computer also is hindered by difficulty in distributing software for it
most software is distributed on cheap floppy disks but the <unk> computer does n't come with a device that reads them
next computer also needs more software applications but <unk> <unk> said <unk> he expects more soon
he said <unk> he expects <unk> <unk> <unk> to introduce a <unk> version of its popular <unk> spreadsheet program in <unk>
educators added that <unk> needs to soon offer a color version of its computer
